Transcrição Completa: 13 Day 13

 

[00:00]"What's this fancy pyramid thing you're showing me, Jeremy, and why is it on day number 13? Great question. This pyramid represents the different pricing structures within my business model."

 

[00:08] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Estrutura de Pirâmide de Preços - 5 Níveis

 

NÚMEROS: 5 níveis distintos de precificação

 

VISUAL: Pirâmide dividida em 5 camadas horizontais, base mais larga representando maior capacidade, topo estreito representando exclusividade premium

 

[00:15]"So, you can see here within this specific layout, I have five different levels. The base to any pyramid where the most real estate is, meaning the most people can occupy, is the attention level."

 

[00:28]"Any business in the entirety of any business ever is built on attention. Meaning you literally cannot go up in life at all whatsoever in a business without attention. Even with the attention of one person, that could get you to a billion dollars."

 

[00:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Nível Base - ATENÇÃO (Fundação)

 

NÚMEROS: Capacidade máxima de clientes

 

VISUAL: Base cinza da pirâmide, área mais ampla, representa fundação do negócio onde toda empresa é construída sobre atenção

 

[00:50]"It doesn't matter. Attention of people are what make money in business. Now, check this out. The top of my pyramid, which is where I like to go next. I place the absolute most valuable real estate because as you can see, it's the top of the pyramid."

 

[01:05]"It's got the best view. There's less real estate up there. There's less room for a bunch of people. Obviously, the service at this kind of level. I mean, you can imagine if you're standing in a pyramid, how wonderful it would be to have all your butlers and your concierge and all the different luxuries and amenities in that kind of environment when they're paying for such a premium real estate service that a lot of other people can't occupy."

 

[01:32] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Nível 5 (TOPO) - Pacote Premium

 

NÚMEROS: $16,000 pacote (mínimo atual)

 

VISUAL: Topo da pirâmide, menor área, representa exclusividade máxima, melhor vista, serviço premium tipo resort 5 estrelas

 

[01:40]"For example, you could emulate a billionaire environment where, I don't know, a five-star resort of some kind might exist. Look at the Porsche Design Tower down in Miami. They have people literally driving their cars in the cars are taking them up a floor and they're dropping off their Porsche 918s. It's pretty sick."

 

[02:00]"All of that is what the people at the tippy top are paying for it. So when they drive into your pyramid, you better be able to car lift them up to the tippy top, serve them at the top because that level right there was a 16k package at the time. That's my minimum now."

 

[02:20] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Nível 4 - Pacote Alto Valor

 

NÚMEROS: $8,000 - $12,000 por mês

 

VISUAL: Segundo nível do topo, área ligeiramente maior, ainda vista privilegiada, serviço de alta qualidade

 

[02:25]"Meaning my minimum, my level number four would now be a $16,000 package. Right now only difference in that is obviously the positioning within the agency itself, bunch of skills, the pricing structure of the level below that costs a little less because they're a little more real estate. Little little less of a view. Still pretty high up on the pyramid. Great service, great business. everything up here in real time between 8 to 12K."

 

[02:55] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Nível 3 - Pacote Social Services

 

NÚMEROS: $4,000 por mês

 

VISUAL: Nível médio da pirâmide, área moderada, balanceamento entre capacidade e exclusividade

 

[03:00]"Right below here I have my social services package which at the time was 4K at the month. Now I'll be honest sometimes I still do on a very low level maybe if we have operational time or maybe if I have a new staff member I sell lower level packages in order to not have as much responsibility on that new staff person. Also a great way to rapid scale if you guys are in that position."

 

[03:25] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Nível 2 - Pacote Entrada

 

NÚMEROS: $1,000 (serviço único, não mensal)

 

VISUAL: Segundo nível acima da base, área ampla, logo acima da barra cinza de atenção, maior capacidade de clientes

 

[03:30]"Now right below that as you can see we have a lot more room on the pyramid. This is right above the attention level here. On that level, right above the gray bar here, this is a $1,000 package. It was a one-time service, not even a monthly transaction."

 

[03:48]"So, this represents a lot of things. A piece of paper that you can use in order to look at exactly what your packages are, how much they cost, how many people you can fit in each section because you can't be a salesperson. You're going to run out of room."

 

[04:05]"If you keep selling packages up here, you don't have enough real estate. And if there's not enough room, but you have room for one more person left, well, damn well that real estate goes up in asset value. They have to pay more for that one spot. If there's only one room left or if there's no rooms left, you got to build a whole extension on top of that pyramid. That's going to cost a lot more, right?"

 

[04:30]"You see what I'm trying to say here? You guys have to look at your business. Like, you got some real estate you're trying to fill. And as soon as the tenants are in there, everything goes up. Soon as your pyramid, which doesn't have a physical location, can move around, aka it can gain value in different locations, aka wherever you position your agency in real life with the different PR strategies you use, the different clients you use, how you're marketing your brand, how you're differentiating your brand."

 

[05:00]"All the things like this can be used for your internal staff, showing other salespeople, showing your team. This is our packages. This is how many people are in these different packages. In my own staff, we also have on the other side of this an extended sheet that we use."

 

[05:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Sistema Visual Impresso - FedEx Kinko

 

NÚMEROS: $50-$100 custo de impressão

 

VISUAL: Poster grande formato da pirâmide, impressão profissional para parede do escritório, ferramenta visual para equipe

 

[05:20]"We printed off this very thing on a big FedEx Kinko board. They print off these things like 50 bucks or maybe maybe 100 bucks. Good pro tip by the way. FedEx Kinko, they have so many promo codes online. You can go take this exact thing, get your own graphic designer to mock it up."

 

[05:40]"And on FedEx Kinko, go and edit in your order so you can print off one of those mega signs and then go open up a new tab and maybe you want to Google some FedEx Kinko discounts. All in all, this might be about 50 bucks, 100 bucks near you."

 

[05:55]"You have the opportunity to paste this right up on your wall. Look at it every single day. have everybody in your company recognize it. And on top of that, you'll see a few things over the next few days that I call visual systems."

 

[06:10]"Guess what? It's day 13 of sales. You know what else this is used for? The opportunity to show your people that are in your pipeline where they can fit. 35% of the people in the world are visual."

 

[06:25] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Estratégia de Vendas Visual

 

NÚMEROS: 35% das pessoas são visuais

 

VISUAL: Conceito de mostrar aos prospects onde eles se encaixam na pirâmide, ferramenta de fechamento visual

 

[06:30]"Show them how much things are. Show them where they're at in the pyramid. Explain to them the environment, the services and the amenities and the luxuries of that particular space within the pyramid. Tell them, 'Hey, listen. You might be more of a number one than a number, but you're talking to me like you're number four on the pyramid. I want you to know some of the services.'"

 

[06:55]"And as you guys can see, if you go download this, there's specific explanations with all the prices right below this. Once again, upwork.com, fiverr.com. Download these things, specify what you want changed, publish in your words, change the company name, change the company logo, change the colors. You're done."

 

[07:15]"You now have it branded. It's all you. Congrats. This is exactly why I give this to you is because you need stuff like this to visualize the flow, visualize your systems, visualize where people at. Go make some money."
