Transcrição Completa: Day 4 - Justifications and Mental Blind Spots

 

[00:00] I'm going to talk to you about justifications. I'm going to be your psychologist right now. And I need you to understand that in real time, every single time that you ever have a little bit of pain in life, it's a good book. It's called Vitalize and Simple Truths.

 

[00:15] You're taking the 30-day sales challenge. You don't have time to read right now anything other than sales and stuff about negotiation. So, do not buy that book and read it unless you're going to put it off afterwards as a reward for hitting your 100 per day.

 

[00:30] But, hear me out. Vital Lies and Simple Truth is a pretty cool book. It gives you a perspective on yourself. In the first chapter, it actually shows you there's this little dot and it says if you cover one of your eyes and you pull the book about six inches to 8 inches away from your face, the dot on the book that you're staring at actually disappears.

 

[00:50] And it represents that psychologically you have blind spots because your mind actually is in real time only able to focus on this little spot in front of you. And every single thing that's inside your entire perspective, including how you actually think, is built upon previous images, including the previous experiences you've had.

 

[01:10] Including maybe these last three days where you're probably thinking to yourself, I haven't been getting a lot of communications. Is this stuff that Jeremy's talking about actually working? Am I in real time doing the right thing, sending the right stuff? Am I...

 

[01:25] Listen, soon as you experience a little bit of pain, right? When you're a little kid, you go up, you touch that first hot thing. Maybe it's your mom's curling iron or flat iron or something or the stove or a fire. I don't know what you touched. You get the idea. You did some dumb shit.

 

[01:40] You learned, "Ah, it's hot." You stopped. You dropped it. You were in pain. You moved away. You realistically haven't done that since. At a very young age, you can represent little decisions like that. Simple things, just simple pains, things you won't do again, right?

 

[01:55] You get in a car accident, you don't want to get in a car accident. That sucks. You're going to drive a little different the next time, right? Your behavior changes after you do something that you experience a little pain in. Whether you realize it or you don't, here's the cool part.

 

[02:10] Vitalizing simple truths will show you from a psychological perspective that there's blind spots within our memory. If we go through something and we experience any kind of pain through it, our own psychology will not only bury it, it will almost erase it and create a blind spot within our mindset itself on what just happened, how it happened, what the experience was.

 

[02:35] All truths are true when you're doing anything. So like, you're right, I'm right, everybody's right. But hear me out without going too deep on you and reminding you you still have to hit your 100 per day.

 

[02:48] Here's what you might be doing right now. You might be thinking to yourself, "Uh, I didn't have as many people as I wanted to hit me up, Jim. I had to follow up too much, Jimmy. I had to do my job, Jimmy. My girlfriend. I had to work out the food, the fucking computer, the internet, the fucking data. It's too long. My webcam, my video, my I don't know what to say. Fucking objection."

 

[03:15] You are in the DMM. You have every single possible answer you ever need. You don't know what you don't know. But your inability to go out and look for the right resources in real time when you choose to stop and not hit your 100 per day is only making you less money than it could be if you would hit your 100 per day.

 

[03:35] I want you to remember something, okay? You have an opportunity right now to cash out and deliver immense value to people in the market, but the only thing and the only person that's going to hold you back is you. Nobody else gives a fuck about you making money other than you. Did you know that?

 

[03:52] I'm here to help you right now having you take the 30-day sales challenge trying to direct your attention to exactly what works. You have to trust the process. If you're not already cashing out and you're taking the 30-day sales challenge, guess what? You're in real time having to give up the ability to agree or disagree.

 

[04:10] You just have to trust the process because the process is what's going to get you the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, big dog. Go out, hit your 100 per day, and don't justify whatever it is that's happening as something that's going to pull you away from the environment.

 

[04:25] Once again, vitalizing simple truths in itself will show you that when you touch that hot thing, you're not going to touch the hot thing again. But you also might forget how painful that experience was. Did you know that women actually can't remember how painful things were unless they relive the pain itself in real time?

 

[04:42] Meaning, if a woman has a kid, for example, did you know how painful it actually is? I don't. If you're a male, you probably don't. And if you're a woman, boy, do I respect you if you've had a child or you're about to because the amount of pain that you're going to bear or that you've seen as a man, a woman bear when having a kid is immense.

 

[05:00] Women because of that amount of pain actually are built on a psychological level from vital lies and simple truths justifying to self from whatever perspective that self builds as to why there wasn't pain through all of the vital lies and simple truths about why you want to perceive it the way you want to perceive it. So the pain goes away.

 

[05:22] That's how our mind takes ourselves away from a worrisome, anxious, fearful state and puts us into a confident, certain, absolutely crystal clear state where we don't and won't go back to what was painful because we've now learned we have solidary beliefs that are created whenever we have pain.

 

[05:40] But those solidary beliefs, reasons, that leverage on why we do or don't do something that's painful again, all comes from whatever we justify and create a vital lie for on why we're going to do or not do something.

 

[05:55] So, seriously, if you've only hit little baby numbers over the last few days for whatever fucking excuses that you want to try to tell me right now in the comments, go ahead. You can tell me literally anything in the comments. It doesn't matter what it is.

 

[06:08] Listen, if you have a family member die, if you've had something from like a perspective of health, I completely get it. But listen, you're in the middle of the 30-day sales challenge. If you're in any other situation or circumstance and you're not hitting anything other than 100, seriously, once again, I'll say it to you just in case you don't remember what I said in the other video.

 

[06:28] You and your excuses if you are not in real time going to hit your 100 per day. You do not have the capacity, the ability to say anything if you are not hitting your numbers.

 

[06:40] And if you are hitting your numbers, go follow up with everybody. Download the HubSpot sales tracker. Go figure out who is opening your emails. Send the oneliners. Follow up. If you're in the sales process and you're about to get to the next steps, I'll tell you what to say tomorrow because you need to hit your 100 per day.

 

[06:58] You create it as a discipline. And do what Jim Rohn says. Discipline's an opportunity to get excited about doing the things that you don't want to do because the easy decisions are also easy to not make. 100 today is easy. It's literally easy.
