01 What is a Business Playbook - YouTube.mp4
Right now in Atlanta, Georgia, sits a literal vault protecting one of the most valuable brand assets in the world. It's the secret recipe for... Coca-Cola. And yes, it is, in fact, housed inside an actual vault inside the actual Coca-Cola headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. Now, that may sound seem a little bit ridiculous, but consider this. On that simple recipe card rests a significant amount of the value of all of the Coca-Cola corporation, which is easily one of the most valuable brands in the world. So when you think about it that way, it kind of makes sense that they would want to protect their secret. Well, what we're going to be doing in this session is starting the process of building out the secret recipe vault for your company. That's right.
It's time to start crafting your company's playbook library. Now that you've mapped your value engines, the next step in the process of creating the set of algorithms that make up your company's operating system is to identify the truly critical stages within these value flows so that they can be documented and turned into step-by-step checklists and standard operating procedures. We call these checklists and SOPs business playbooks. So, what is a business playbook? Very simply, business playbooks are a set of actionable, step-by-step checklists that document the individual task that must be completed, as well as the order. Those tasks must be completed in to execute a repeatable process or activity. In other words, it's not just about figuring out, 'Okay, this is generally what you do and how you do it.' Give it your best shot.
It is the specifics of 'do this,' then 'that,' then 'that,' and then run it through this checklist when you're done, just to make sure you did it right. While value engines give us the big picture, Playbooks give us the down and dirty, in the trenches, detail that we actually need to get real work done. Now, as a way of introducing this concept. I want you to tell me if any of the following frustrations sound familiar. The first is what we refer to as the shoulder tap. You're familiar with the shoulder tap, right? This is when you're sitting there, minding your own business, just trying to get some work done, and somebody knocks on your office door, hits you up on Slack, or literally taps you on your shoulder just to ask, 'Hey, got a second?' You and I both know that a second is never a second.
It's always measured in minutes, if not hours, and even if the interaction is rel- short, the interruption causes a break in concentration that can take anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes to recover from. So why does this happen, right? I mean, you've got good people. They care. They know what they're doing. So why did the shoulder taps keep happening? Well, I believe shoulder taps happen because good people simply don't trust themselves to do the job that you have entrusted them to do. Now, I'm going to say this again because it's really, really important, all right? It's not that you don't trust them. The issue is that they don't trust themselves. So why, right? Why don't they trust themselves? Again, it's not because they're lazy or incompetent or they don't care.
In fact, the opposite is probably true. They're hard workers and they do care. The problem is they lack certainty. Fortunately, playbooks will give them the certainty they crave, which means less shoulder taps and interruptions for you. Another common frustration is the 'oops, my bad,' I'm guessing you've heard your fair share of 'oops, my bad's at this point in your career. The 'oops, my bad' happens when a good person who is trying hard simply messes up, right? We're talking about a classic case of human error. Now, let's be honest. We all make the occasional bad hire. Right, the person who isn't a fit or who just can't do the job that you hired them to do. These scenarios aren't a lot of fun, but they're fairly simple to address, right?
We help them. We work with them, and if they still can't get the job done, we part ways. It's simple. But what happens when good people who do know what they're doing simply mess up? How do we prevent that from happening? And what do we do when it happens? Again, it's one thing if someone is completely incompetent. What do you do when a competent person simply screws up? When does human error cross over into careless negligence and how do you address the issue without creating a culture of fear? Well, you can never completely eliminate human error, but we absolutely can reduce it, and we can also put systems in place to ensure that everyone learns from it. From the mistake, so that the company is actually better for it.
And it's playbooks that make this possible. Okay, so we talked about shoulder taps. We talked about the oops, my bad. Now we come to the most dangerous of all the frustrations. The dreaded black box. Black boxes are created when someone within the organization hoards their knowledge and refuses to share it with anyone else. On the team. Rather than documenting and sharing what they know, they hold it. They hold it close and they say, 'you know,' no, this is mine, as though, you know, they're Gollum, right? It's their precious kind of thing, as though it's, you know, the golden ticket that will ensure that they always have a job at your company. Well, I don't know about you, but I utterly despise politics, turf wars, and culture of toxicity that is created when one or more people black box their knowledge.
So we don't allow it, right? We do not allow this at the company. In fact, one of our core values is document and share what you know. And you should know that we take our core values very seriously. We hire, train, and, if necessary, fire by our values, which means... means that black boxing information is quite literally a fireable offense. But what if the biggest offender of black box creation is you? Well, that brings me to the final frustration, which is feeling trapped. Nothing ever happens unless I do it. Have you ever heard yourself say that? If so, we want to eliminate that completely. And again, business playbooks will allow you to do just that. So the goal of this session is simple. We want to help you clone your best people and get more work done in less time, the right way, the first time. That's what this session is all about. And the way that we're going to accomplish it is by building your business playbook library. So, let's get started.
