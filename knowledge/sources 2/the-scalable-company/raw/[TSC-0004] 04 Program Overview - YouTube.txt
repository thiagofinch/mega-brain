04 Program Overview - YouTube.mp4
This program is broken into three phases. Phase one is the build phase. During this phase, we'll leverage the six tools in the ScalableOS framework to document your company's algorithms, design your communication, architecture, and build your clarity compass. This phase takes about six to eight weeks and will include the bulk of the heavy lifting in this program. Phase two is the install phase. During this phase, you'll hold a two-day strategic planning meeting with your leadership team. This will then be followed up by a company-wide rollout of the new operating system. This phase typically takes around two to three weeks, and in my opinion, is the most fun of all. Phase three is the optimize phase, and this one never truly ends.
During this phase, you'll meet every 90 days with your leadership team to plan for the next quarter and make any necessary upgrades to your company's operating system. By the time we're finished, you'll have a fully customized and scalable operating system that can scale your business without you so that you can step out of the day-to-day and achieve your version of the entrepreneurial dream. And I want you to know, at The Scalable Company, we really want this for you. It's quite literally our mission. We want you to hit your number. We want you to build wealth. And we want you to make the kind of impact that not even you know that you're capable of making right now. And this, what we're doing right now, this is the first step in that journey. So again, welcome to the Scalable Operating System Accelerator. I'm so glad you're here and I can't wait to get started.
