03 Growth Engines Explained - YouTube.mp4
How do customers... happen? This is the question that we are answering when we map our growth engines. Now, I want you to imagine something. I want you to imagine that you are a pirate and you have accumulated a vast treasure that you have buried for safekeeping. There's just one problem. You forgot where you buried the treasure. This sounds a little bit silly, but it's actually what happens to a lot of businesses. They generate customers, their treasure. But they don't remember exactly how it happened. So they're not able to access more of this treasure in the future. The good news is that the process of mapping... growth engine is a bit like rediscovering that lost treasure map. And that's what we're doing. We are creating a map to the long-lost treasure.
That is an endless stream of customers and clients for your business. Now, this process of mapping how customers happen is actually a lesson that I had to learn the hard way. So picture this. The year is 2006, and I'm sitting alone at a bar in Dallas, Texas, drinking by myself and feeling very, very sorry for myself. Just three years prior, I had made the entrepreneurial leap. My little side projects, my little side hustles were finally generating enough income that I could quit. My job and focus on my business full time. My simple little business had finally broken through the six figure sales barrier and I was confident that my first million dollar year was just over the horizon line. But fast forward a few years and that simple and profitable little business had transformed into a bloated money-sucking monster.
Now I had a team, I had an office, I had really expensive software subscriptions, and to put it bluntly, I was not doing well. My profits were non-existent, my sales were in decline, and without even realizing it, I had somehow managed to rack up $250,000. In credit card debt and personal lines of credit. Just trying every tactic, buying every piece of software, and hiring every consultant I could find in a desperate attempt to turn things around. Oh yeah, and to top it all off, it all off, my wife and I had just purchased a brand new home with a brand new mortgage to make room for the brand new baby that we had just brought home from the hospital a few months earlier. To put it bluntly, I was terrified.
Nothing was working and I felt like an absolute failure. So there I sit at a bar. In Dallas, Texas. By myself, just trying to figure out how everything went so wrong, so fast, when for a time at least, everything seemed to be going so well. At the time, my only option, it seemed, was to just quit. To shut down the company, lay off my employees, declare bankruptcy, and ask for my old job back. But it was in that moment that a just kind of random memory popped into my mind. It wasn't a significant moment, just a conversation that I'd had with a friend at the same bar a year or so before. And what we were talking about is how all the best business... ideas were conceived on the back of a napkin.
I mean, think about it. Some of the most amazing and impactful business ideas, whether it was the idea for Ethernet or the idea for Southwest Airlines or even JK Rowling scribbling out the basic plot lines and character traits for the Harry Potter book series, whether you realize it or not, all of those came about on the back of a napkin. There's just something magical about the simplicity of a napkin, my friend and I ultimately decided. Now, that conversation might have lasted maybe only a minute or two. Again, it really didn't seem like all that significant of a moment at the time. But for some reason... That conversation, right? That tiny little insignificant moment in time popped right back into my head while I was sitting at that bar by myself at my lowest low.
And that's when it hit me. I had made things too complicated. My business was too... complicated. I didn't know how any of it worked anymore, which is why I'd lost my Midas touch. The treasure wasn't gone, I just forgot where it was buried. So, I made myself a deal. If I can describe how my business works, if I can document the simple concept of how customers happen using just a single napkin. Then I'll keep going. I'll pay my tab. I'll go to bed. And in the morning, I'll start working my napkin plan until I physically and financially just can't go on. And if I fail. If I fail to document how customers happen on this napkin, I'll pay the tab.
I'll go to bed and, in the morning, I'll start the process of shutting down my company and declaring personal bankruptcy. At that moment, I looked up and, sure enough, there was a stack of cocktail napkins within arm's reach. I grabbed one off the top, borrowed a pen from the bartender, and got to work. And what I wrote that night— sitting alone at a bar on that simple little napkin. Quite literally changed my life. For the first time in my life, I had documented how customers happened. And that made all the difference. Today, that silly little napkin sits in a frame in my office and I refer to it semi-jokingly as my million dollars. napkin. Now, I realize that's a little bit corny, but what I wrote on that napkin didn't just turn my business around.
It didn't just get me out of debt. Within 12 months of creating that napkin, I had generated $1 million in revenue for the first time in my entrepreneurial career. Since then, we've gone on to launch dozens of companies. We've generated hundreds of millions in sales. We've had three companies on the Inc. 500 list simultaneously. We've had two eight-figure exits and a lot of seven-figure exits. And not to be weird, but life is pretty good. And the best part is I now have the ability to do only the work I truly love doing while creating a life for myself, my family, and my team that I could only dream of living when I was sitting alone at that bar in Dallas, Texas. So why do I tell you that story? Well, here's the lesson. Never. Never underestimate the power of simply documenting how customers happen in your business. This one process that started on a napkin at a bar continues to this day with sticky notes and whiteboards— quite literally— changed my life. And I'm confident it can change yours too.
