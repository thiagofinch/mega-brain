04 Design the Playbook - YouTube.mp4
Once you have defined the process that you're going to be documenting, the next step is to actually design that process in the form of a step-by-step checklist. Most people get this completely out of order. What they do is they say, 'All right, this is the process that we need to design, so let's start.' Documenting. They get out a sheet of paper or they open Excel or a Google doc and they just start documenting away, right? They're like, 'Okay, step one is this. Step two is this. I'm pretty sure. That, you know, step three is this, you know, and four and so on and so on. Look, don't do that. Okay. Don't do that. I promise, if you do, you are going to miss steps. So here's what you need to do instead.
The person who actually does this process on a normal basis, again, this should be the playbook owner. They need to do the task. That's it. Just have them do the task like they normally would. Then, while they're doing the task, have them document what they're doing while they're doing it. Now, if for some reason it isn't practical for them to document what they're doing, doing in real time, just have them document what they did immediately after they complete the task while it's still fresh on their mind. Now comes the important part. Once this task has been documented, have the person who does the task, the person who created the actual documentation, right? The playbook owner, have them do the task again. But this time, ask them to blindly follow their own process.
So, let's say the process owner, this playbook owner is named Bob. Bob would do the task. Bob would document the task in simple checklist form while he is doing it or immediately after, and then Bob would do the task again. But this time, Bob would do the task while blindly following the step-by-step checklist that Bob just created. What you'll find, 9 times out of 10, is that Bob, even though he does this task every day, and even though he's following his own process that he literally just created moments earlier, will likely say something like, 'I forgot about this step.' And oh, dang, I forgot about this one too. All right. It happens all the time. So do not allow yourself or anyone in your team to skip this.
Step once the process has been documented, go back and perform the task again, following the checklist that was just created. I promise. All right, I promise you will see things that were missed. Okay, so we've done the task, we've documented the task, and we've done the task again, following the documentation. Now it's time for a field test. For the field test, all we're doing is handing the documentation, which, at this point, again, it should just be a simple step-by-step checklist. With, you know, perhaps some additional descriptions or an accompanying walkthrough video, you're just going to hand this over to someone in the organization who, and this is critical, has never... formed this task before. For example, let's say the person who is field testing Bob's process is named Jan.
So you would say, 'Hey Jan, I want you to follow this. Process step by step so we can see if we missed anything.' Don't worry if you get stuck or confused. We aren't testing your knowledge and abilities. We're testing the accuracy of the documentation. Now I want to pause here because that last part is really, really important. All right. So I don't want you to miss it. Make sure that the person who is performing the field test, right? Make sure that they understand that they are not being tested, right? They gotta know this. They gotta know that they're not the subject of the test. The goal is to check the accuracy and completeness of the documentation. So if your field tester gets stuck or confused, that simply means they're doing their job.
Also, try to select a field tester who has, you know, a general understanding of the task, but who rarely, or again, ideally never performs it. If someone has too much content, if they know too much, they're going to wind up filling in some of the missing steps even without realizing that they're doing it. This is known as the curse of knowledge. On the other hand, if someone has zero contact, they're gonna wind up asking questions and you know get stuck in places that no documentation is able to fix. So make sure that you select someone who at the very least understands your customer. They need to understand your products. And they need to understand the general objective of the task.
You might even want to spend some time, you know, just walking through the associated value engine, just so they fully understand the context of the task and how it fits into the overarching business model. Once an initial field test has been performed, have the original documenter, again, in this case, our friend Bob, make any necessary tweaks and adjustments. If significant updates were needed, then you're going to need to run another field test with a different person and repeat this process until the documentation is delivering the desired end result. Only then can you add this checklist to your playbook library, which is exactly what the next step is all about.
