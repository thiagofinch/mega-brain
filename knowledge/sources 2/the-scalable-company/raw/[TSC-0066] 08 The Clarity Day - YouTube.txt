08 The Clarity Day - YouTube.mp4
During the session, we talked about how to build your clarity compass. But remember, I don't want you to build your clarity compass out right now by yourself. Again. I don't want you to build it right now. Okay? The goal of the clarity compass is to create both clarity and alignment between the company and your team, as well as the company and your customers. And it's not going to accomplish either if you build yours in a vacuum. So brainstorm lots of ideas and take lots of notes. But do not complete your clarity compass and, definitely, definitely, definitely, do not share a draft of your clarity compass with your team. Prior to your first quarterly strategic planning meeting, and speaking of your first quarterly planning meeting, if you haven't already scheduled that, now is the time.
planning session will kick off with a clarity day where you will finalize your clarity compass and then it rolls into your first quarterly sprint planning meeting. So... If you're ready to build out your clarity compass, then get your first two-day planning meeting scheduled because the first day is all about creating clarity. So that's the clarity compass. I'm excited to see how it helps align the vectors in your organization. I know it's been one of the most powerful and valuable tools in our operating system, and I'm confident it's going to be one of the most valuable in yours too.
