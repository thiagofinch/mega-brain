01 How to Facilitate a Quarterly Sprint Planning Session - YouTube.mp4
Where this is going to begin, the way that you're going to lead off this particular session is just with a general welcome and overview. So we've got a very, very simple cover slide here that I would encourage you to drop in your company logo. Talk about what quarter and year are you planning for, and then what's the date. All this is good for posterity. It's also good sometimes— We just forget this stuff. It's nice to go back and to be able to reference. We've got a simple sample agenda for you here. You know, so you can say in the morning, we're going to go over the ground rules, meeting goals. We're going to review the 12Q plan. I didn't put times on here and I encourage you not to put times either.
A lot to be flexible. So we have like, hey, as our goal, we would like to, before we break for lunch, to brainstorm our quarterly pillars, right? So whatever the quarterly pillar and themes are for this quarter, we would like to generally have that done before lunch, but I wanna encourage you, make sure everybody knows. Look, if we're falling a bit behind, that's okay. You know, we will get caught up. Now, this next section is really, really important. When we get into the ground rules, your tendency is going to be to skip this. I know because I've been doing this for a long time. I've been, you know, as we've been sharing this with the folks, they're like, 'No, no, no.' I'm not going to go through all the ground rule stuff.
My team knows how to act. This is so important for so many reasons. Number one, there's a good chance they don't. I mean, even as full-grown adults, sometimes we get into meetings and you know, we're distracted. We're checking our phones. We're doing different stuff. We're not focused. We're not in the moment. frankly, just behaving like children. Also, there's going to be times during this meeting where it can get a little bit tense. There's going to be times when you're digging into numbers and... maybe you're falling a bit behind, right? Or maybe there's projects that somebody really believes in their heart of hearts that they need to get done and others don't. We need to create a foundation of trust. We need to create a, just kind of this baseline of this is what we all agree to.
This is what we all believe to be true. Now, again, remember in this moment, I want to kind of set the scene. This is day two. All right. Remember the previous day, you either did your clarity day. If this was the very first time that you were doing a quarterly sprint plan. Or, you did the monthly business review. Now, hopefully, that session on day one was followed by some trust-building activities. Hopefully, you had a chance to go out to dinner, to break bread together, to really forge some of these relationships. And during one of those meetings, there's a good chance that you already set these ground rules. And so this is more of a review. But it's here anyway. And even if you did go through these same ground rules the previous day, trust me, they are worth reviewing here.
So the way that I would do this is simply say, 'Okay, everybody, welcome. Remember the ground rules.' I know we talked about this yesterday, but remember the ground rules. Number one, be honest. All right. Tell it like it is. Conflict is good. We're not going to be mean, obviously, but let's not hedge. And certainly, let's not spend stuff. We want to practice total honesty. Also, be present. Right. Be present. So make sure if we take a bathroom break, we take a lunch break, be back here on time. Right. Be in the room. Be present. Also. You know, put your phones away, right? Get off of email, right? Now is not the time to do that. We'll take some breaks. We'll do it. If there's a big enough emergency, people will let us know.
All right, so don't check email. Be here, be present. Obviously, if there's an emergency, you can step out. Barring an emergency, let's just be here together. Thirdly, be focused. All right, focus. Let's try to avoid tangents. That's why we have, and this is where, again, kind of as an aside, this is where you would reference. The bottleneck and opportunity list, that's why we have the B &O list. Right? So there's going to be times where something comes up. And if it seems a little bit off track, I'm going to say, 'Hey, let's hold on that.' I'm going to add it to the list. Okay. So you're telling them right now, how are you going to deal with tangents? You're teaching them about the biennales. That way, they know how this works.
Another reason why these ground rules are important. And then, lastly, be humble. Tell them this is not a place for ego. This is not a place for blame. This is a place to figure stuff out for the benefit of the company. And then you're going to close this and say, before we move on, can we all agree to these ground rules? Can we agree? And I would encourage you, just like if you go, you know, when you go and sit in an exit row in an airplane and they're like, 'I need a verbal yes that you can do all these things.' I'm like, 'Yes, yes.' I would go around the room, even if it's a little bit awkward, and say, 'Can we agree to this?' Yes. Yes. Yes.
Great. Now, I like to start off all of our different meetings with a mantra. All right. And so in this case, you know, the mantra for the quarterly sprint plan is what needs to be done in order for this to happen. Right. So this is the thing. And again, it's just good to reference. And so if I were getting to the section, I'm leading this meeting, I would say, 'OK, team.' So. Our mantra... What you probably will hear me say this, by the way, just kind of as an aside, you may even want to write this on the board, right? So you may want to write this up here just so that it's there for all to see that you can reference, right? Okay, everybody.
Our mantra for this meeting is what needs to be true in order for this to happen. This is our mantra. This is what I would want to say. So don't say... You know, it can't. Don't say, that's not how we do it. Right? And by the way, what I just said, again, just kind of as a side note. is in the presenter notes. If you look in the presenter notes, it says, don't say it can't. Don't say that's not how we do it. So we're not going to do that. We're banishing those ideas. We're banishing the idea of, but we can't. We're banishing the idea of, that's not how we do it. We're banishing... the notion of, yeah, but we tried that before and it didn't work. All right.
Instead, the question we want to ask—when we come up against something that seems truly difficult—is: What needs to be true in order for this to happen? Can we all agree on this mantra? Yeah. Now again, the reason that we're doing this, right—because we're inoculating against possible future objections. You know, if somebody's... You know, two people on your team are really duking out this music, but we can't do that. We just can't. We don't have the resources. You can suddenly be like, 'Hey, remember our mantra? We're not going to say you can't.' We're going to say what needs to be true. And maybe what needs to be true is we have to be able to defy gravity and build a time machine. And then we decide we can't.
But we're at least going to ask the question. All right, so we got the mantra, got the agenda, got all the ground rules. Now, what's the goal? Setting the intention. So our goal is really, really simple. What we're going to do is we're simply going to review the results and share learnings from the previous quarter and align on goals and critical areas of focus necessary to stay on track for our 12Q plan. All right, so you would just read this part. Once you have done that, by the way, everything I just showed you shouldn't take any more than 15, 20 minutes. Maybe get it done in 10. If you don't ramble on as much as I do. But once you have done that, then you're ready to move on to the next step.
All right, so the next step in the quarterly sprint planning facilitation process is to review your 12Q plan. All right, so at this point, hopefully you've already created a 12Q plan with your team. If not... What you been doing? Because we talked about it earlier on. It's a part of the Clarity Day, so hopefully you've done it. So we're simply going to say, all right. Let's review our 12-cube plan. On the slide deck, there is a not-so-lovely, it's an intentionally ugly slide that says, 'Replace this slide with your 12-cube plan.' And what you're going to do in this section, it's really, really simple. It shouldn't take that long. We've allowed about 20 minutes for this, but really it should only take maybe five to 10 minutes.
You're simply going to look at a 12-Q plan, go down to the quarter in question, and say, 'Are we on track ahead or behind? How we doing? Generally, on track, looking good. Are we falling a bit behind? Are we ahead? And you say, 'What kind of... And based on that, this is really about setting the tone. Okay.' It's about saying, okay, we're behind. So we need to be thinking as we're going through today, we're behind. We need to get caught up. Right? That's you setting the tone. Or, you know what, we're on track, we're doing okay. We're living with the plan, so. When you look for areas of opportunity, we don't want to fall behind. Where can we optimize or, we're ahead.
Maybe we need to depending on how, what comes out this meeting, we may need to even increase our goals. But this section is simply about, let's agree on what is, is, right? Let's agree on what reality is. Let's get everybody in the company on the same page, agreeing like, yep. We're ahead. We're behind. We're looking pretty good. This is so important when you have multiple teams. Because you might have one team, maybe the sales team is like, 'We're crushing it. We're great. We're the best.' And maybe your product team is like, 'We're struggling.' What this does is it is one tone, one foundation, one truth. That everybody in the room agrees to, and you're referencing back to an objective document that everybody played a role in creating.
All right, so that's it. Again, 10, 15, maybe 20 minutes if there's some discussion. Just check out your 12Q plan. Are you on track? Are you ahead? Are you behind? Set the tone. Once you've done that, you can move on to the next step. So this next section in the quarterly sprint planning process is what we call the look back and 90-day game plan. So what we're simply going to do is contextualize our reality. So we want to look back over the previous 90 days and we just want to get a sense of, what was good? What was bad? What were the lessons? What can we take from it? And it really is just. I don't know, it's this very freeing kind of moment that clears the mechanism.
It just sort of gets everything out so that you can prepare to put new in, right? It's kind of the emotional equivalent of spring cleaning, of going in and just getting all the clutter out of your closets and deciding what can we get rid of and what do we want to keep. All right, so the way you're going to kick this section off is to look at the quarterly sprint plan. If this is the first time, you can delete this slide, but you're simply going to look at the quarterly sprint plan for the previous quarter, and you're going to ask the question, 'Did we do what we said we would do?' But again, we're setting the tone. 'Did we do what we said we would do?' It is your job as the leader, as the facilitator, to set the tone.
This is what we said we would do last quarter. Did we do it now? If this is the first time that you're doing one of these, you obviously won't have this stuff, but I do still think it's worth just kind of having a conversation. Hey, let's think about last quarter. What are some of the things we said we would do? So you can have a general conversation. Once you've done this once, it becomes very, very, very clear and very objective. Did we do it? This is what we said we would do. Now, this is also important because... Sometimes you'll look at the quarterly sprint plan from the previous quarter and you would say, 'This was really good and it was working and a lot of these projects aren't quite done.' There's a lot here that we should plan on extending into another quarter.
So, what you would ask, and again, this is in the presenter notes: 'Should this plan be extended another quarter or do we need a fresh plan?' If everybody agrees, look, the plan for last quarter was great. We just needed more time. And this is going to be a really short planning meeting. I'd still go through the motions. I would still go through the process. But if everybody generally agrees, like... That was a good plan. We just need more time. It's going to be a short one. If everybody agrees, no— we need a new plan. Because either we did all that stuff, or we did it and it didn't work, so let's do something new. Either way. You want to be clear. What are the things from last quarter that we want to bring into this one?
What are the things from last quarter that we either shouldn't bring or we can't because they're done? All right, so that's kind of the first step. And don't spend too much time dwelling here. You know, five minutes or so is enough. Then what you're going to do is you're going to move on to the 90-day plan— game plan. I love this exercise. Again, this is an exercise that we do every quarter as a team is an exercise that I do personally as an individual. It's an exercise that we do every quarter with our mastermind members. And it's one that I would encourage you to do with your team. And that's why we have built it into the quarterly sprint planning process. What we are doing with this 90-day game plan is we are doing business with the past.
We're anchoring the present and we're envisioning the future. In other words, we're contextualizing everything. We're getting crystal clear. Again, just taking some time before we get started on... Getting everybody literally on the same page in some cases, getting their thoughts, their words, their ideas on this page. Now, the reason that we do this is you got to do business with the past. You cannot move forward in life until you have looked back and acknowledged that previous reality. If you don't do that, then whatever happened in the past, bad or good—maybe you had some really big wins that you're like, 'now you're walking around like you're God's gift of business' and you're bringing all this positivity into the future with you, also known as like ego and arrogance.
You don't want to bring any of that stuff with you. The only thing you want to bring with you are lessons. Okay, so we got to do business with the past. We're gonna be doomed to bring it forward in the form of an anchor, right? So I do business with the past. We're gonna uncover some obvious bottlenecks and opportunities that are going to inform some of these you know key initiatives and other projects and possibly even some success metrics. We're just gonna clear the mind. We're just going to clear the mind. You probably have heard about inbox zero, this idea of getting completely clear, not your inbox, getting it to zero. Think about this as mind box zero. All right, mind box zero. Now, the way this process works, right?
The way this process works is: you pass out these worksheets to everybody who's in the room and you say, 'Okay, everybody, step one, we're going to think about pride and regret.' So I'm going to put two minutes on the clock, right? I want you to focus on the first column and I'm simply going to ask. For you specifically, what are you most proud of over the last 90 days and what regrets do you have? Now, the question I just asked you there, the question I just posed, again, it's in the presenter notes. You don't have to remember that. Read the presenter notes, right? What are you most proud of over the last 90 days and what regrets do you have? You got it.
Okay, so ask the question, put two minutes on the clock, and just let everybody sit there in silence. It can feel a little bit weird. but it's important. Right. This is doing business with the past. Now, what you want your team to do is you want them to acknowledge, 'Hey. Regrets are okay. It's okay if we have some regrets. So I would actually spend a little bit of time, and we're going to talk about this, having them share some of these things. But this is about letting them know, 'Hey, we're not going to deny our failures. We're not going to spin them.' We're going to linger in a moment, and learn from them, and bring the learnings forward. Okay. Now, what I like to say here, and again, it's in the presenter notes, is, okay, everybody.
Our failures and our regrets don't define us. They simply point us towards areas of opportunity. All right, so let's take them. I'm glad they're here. Let's learn from them. That's great, but we're not going to linger on them any more beyond this point. Deal? All right, let's move on to step two. Right, step two. What are you most confident in? Where do you feel you are lacking? So where do you have a lot of confidence for yourself, maybe for your team? Where do you feel that you're lacking? Again, the quote is in the presenter notes. So for example, you know— maybe you feel really strongly about our product line, maybe you feel like some stuff's lacking there. Maybe you feel really strongly about some of the folks that are on your team.
Maybe you know there's some critical roles missing, right? Maybe you feel really good about the processes. Maybe you feel like the processes have failed you. Again, these examples that I've given that I would encourage you to call out as well, they're in the presenter notes. Two minutes there, silence. Okay, let's move on. Step three. Excitement and worry, right? The question here is, what are you most excited about as we look forward into this next quarter? What worries you? All right, so again, just kind of. I want to make sure that we're clear on where we are. Step number one, we looked back into the previous 90 days. We talked about kind of some areas of pride, some areas of regret.
We then thought about our now, our present, where are some areas we're really confident, where do we feel we lack, and here, now we're beginning to look outward. forward. Right. What are we worried about? What are we really, really, really excited about? The new product launch is emerging. Is there a new hire that's going to start? Maybe you're considering a sale or a merger. What are people excited about? Then what you do is you have everybody say, 'Please take two minutes' and I want you to write down three to five projects that you believe. If completed, would make the next 90 days more successful than the previous. I write down three to five projects. Also known as a key initiative, by the way.
We're beginning to get people to think about those key initiatives, but what are three to five projects that, if completed, would make the 90 days more successful than the previous 90? What we're doing, in addition to clearing the mechanism and all the other things, we're beginning to brainstorm key initiatives. Now, this is the most important part of this exercise: share. Share time. And so after they've gone through this exercise, I would go around and I would say, 'Okay. Who's brave? Who's willing to share what they wrote? And you just go around the room and you let people share. And I always think it's interesting if somebody points an area of pride or regret to say, 'Who agrees with that? Who agrees? Raise your hand. Who had that on theirs? Yeah. Okay.
Y'all had it. Who disagrees? And allow for there to be some discussion. Right? So if somebody says something, who agrees? Yep, that was on my list. Does anybody disagree? I completely disagree. Great. Get it out. It can be a little bit scary at first to think about, perhaps there being some conflict, but it's critical. It's absolutely positively critical that that's there. What about some wins? What were some wins? Like who had that? Who had that as their win? Oh my gosh, you completely forgot about that, right? So it's a really good way to open it up. Where are you confident? I'm confident that, yeah, I had that on mine. Okay, so in all these things, when somebody shares, your follow-up questions are: who else had that? Who disagrees? Somebody shares.
Who else had that? Who disagreed? Who else has it? Who disagrees? You go around the room. Now, once everybody's had a chance to do this, and again, it's very cathartic. It feels really good to get all this stuff out. That's when you're going to flash this very simple slide right here, which is maybe one of the most powerful slides in this entire deck. Are you ready to turn the page? And the words, which I'm going to read them verbatim, just as I would encourage you to do, are as follows. So the slide comes up right from the page. And you would say, 'We can't change the past, but we can learn from it, which is exactly what we have done.' So let's leave the past in the past.
The good, the bad, and the ugly. Right? Now, can we move forward? It's an acknowledgment. We can't change the past, but we can learn from it. We can't change the past. But we can... take all the little bits and pieces that we're gonna bring forward and we can do that. And that's exactly what we've done. Now. Can. We. Move. forward. And it is critical at this juncture that you go around again to each person in the room, just like you did with the ground rules. Can we move forward? Yes, yes, yes, yes. You were basically wiping the slate clean. You're saying, 'I don't care what happened last quarter.' Bob, I don't care if Jan pissed you off. Can we move forward? If not, you had an opportunity to chat about, can we move forward?
It's absolutely critical. That you achieve this in this moment, or everything else that we're going to do is going to just, again, feel like it's got an anchor around its neck. All right. 90-day game plan, critical exercise once you've done it. Once you complete it, once everybody has agreed that they're willing to move forward, then you're ready to move on to the actual quarterly sprint planning process, which is what we're going to do in the next lesson. All right, so when you move into the actual quarterly sprint planning process, it's helpful just to review the process as a whole, to give people a sense of what is it exactly that we are doing. Now, it would take no more than about kind of 10 minutes to do this, but it's a good reminder.
It's also good if you have any new people on the team. So basically, okay. Here is how we do quarterly planning at this company. So everything kicks off with the leadership team doing a quarterly planning meeting. That is what we are doing here. All right. What we're going to do when we're done here is we're going to take the plan that we come up with here today. And we're going to push that down to our teams. We're going to share it with the teams. And we're going to ask the teams to come back and share what are some key initiatives that maybe we forgot. Right. So they're going to review it, say, 'Hey, what about this?' 'What about this?' Or I don't think we can get this one done.
I don't think we have the resources. They're then going to push that back to us. We're going to review and we're going to integrate. We're going to take all the different... bits of advice and feedback from all the teams. We're going to integrate it together. And then what we're going to do is we're going to finalize that integrated plan down to the team. We're going to reveal that at a meeting that is forthcoming. We're going to ask for buy-in and we are going to get started. So where are we in the process? We are right here at the start. All right. Now, the tool that we're going to be using here together is this quarterly sprint plan.
And what I would simply do, I'm not going to go through all this with you because I already went through this with you earlier, but I would explain to them how it. Works right. So this is where you would go through and you'd say, 'So the first thing we're going to do, let's get clear on the time period.' Right? Uh, let's get really clear on, you know, we're gonna just decide what our theme is. Okay. So you go through The same basic explanation that I went through with you. Leading off your meeting. So if you want to kind of go back to that previous lesson and review how I explained this. Watch it. It's an example of how you would do that as well, but you're simply walking through.
All the different areas. This is the theme. We're going to come up with our success metrics. We're going to define our strategic pillars. We're going to define those key initiatives. That is what is going to make up the quarterly sprint plan. Again, even if you're dealing with a team that's been around for months, years, if you've gone through this a dozen times together, I encourage you to review it. Review it for their sake. Review it for the sake of any new people. Review it because, frankly, as humans, we just flat out forget. Once you've reviewed it— Be ready to dig in and start the brainstorming process. So let's do that now. So the first section when we're going to get in and really start actually building out the quarterly sprint plan is just to brain dump, to brainstorm.
And specifically, we're looking to brainstorm. Possible key initiative ideas. Now, if you recall, we kind of began this process when we asked people their focus five back in the 90-day game plan. So we said, what are kind of three to five? projects that, if completed, would make the next 90 days more successful than the previous. Remember that? That was kind of a part of that process. So what you would simply do when you get to this slide is you would have this slide that you can see on your screen right now. You would put it up. And you'd say, 'Okay, everybody.' So this is what we're going to be doing for the next little bit. We're going to be brainstorming possible key initiative ideas. All right. You would simply say.
What I'm going to do right now, everybody, take five minutes. I'm going to put five minutes on the clock. You can tell them, just brainstorm one idea per sticky note. You can say, go back and look at your 90-day game plan, because you probably wrote some things down in there. You could say, hey, let's look at the 12Q planning canvas, because if you recall, there's a section there— where you put in some key initiative ideas— but just say. Brainstorm, right? What are all the open, and this is big, and should be open projects? So it's both of those. It's what are the projects that you're currently working on, and what are the projects that you believe you should be working on? Five minutes on the clock, one idea. Per sticky note, go.
And then you do just that and you let everybody work. In relative silence then. You come back and you say, 'Okay, everybody, now what we're going to do is we're going to present our key initiative ideas.' All right, so. Who's willing to go first? Let's take five minutes per person. So we've allowed about 30 minutes for this. It may go a little bit longer if you have a larger team. You know, this step, maybe 30, 40 minutes. What you're going to do, though, is you're going to have somebody come up. And I like starting with the person who has the biggest stack of stuff. Right, so you're like, 'All right, Jim.' Seems like he got a whole lot of stuff over there. Big old stack. So why don't you come up here?
And then what Jim would do. Is Jim would come up to the whiteboard and would find an area on the whiteboard that was relatively clean. So right here, you know, this is why I like having multiple whiteboards. So Jim would just go, 'Okay, so I... you know. We need to rebuild our home page. You know, that's an important one that we're working on.' There's this new product over here that we've been working on that we need to finally kind of build the sales page for that, get that going. I need to hire somebody new. And so Jim just goes and puts all this up and kind of briefly explains it. It's like, 'Hey, thanks, Jim. Who wants to go next?' And then Sally comes up.
So you go, 'All right, Sally, looks like you got a fairly large stack of post-its there as well. Why don't you come out?' He's like, 'Yeah, you know, I had, Jim had hiring this person. That was on mine too. I also had that we need to really update our tech stack in this particular area. We need to get a new kind of email solution. Our current one is a little bit lacking. Right.' And so, as each person goes, not only do they put up their ideas, but when they have something that is the same as somebody else's. They stack it. All right, this is incredibly important because this stacking method is sort of like a you know, a passive voting tool. If a lot of people in the room had the same thing, well, guess what?
That's probably a good candidate for a key initiative that really is going to need to make the list. Okay, so everybody goes around and they do it. Everybody puts theirs up. So, okay, this is all the stuff. Everybody had a brain dump. Great. Great. Now... What are some general themes that we're starting to see? So if you just look at the board, you'll see certain themes begin to emerge. Right? Certain themes you start looking at and you're like, 'Oh, you know, it seems like we're doing a lot of things around, you know, we're going to launch a bunch of new products.' All of these over here were related to launching new products. We had a lot of things here that were about launching the new.
And there was also a bunch about hiring. Upgrading our talent, like that was a biggie. Everybody sort of agreed to that, you know, and there's one here for that as well, right? You take the different ideas and you begin to group them. and you begin to theme them. So in doing so, what you're doing is not only beginning to define some of your key initiatives, you're also beginning to define some of the sub-themes that will ultimately make up your strategic pillars. Now, as you're going through, right, you're going to discuss, you're going to prioritize. So when you go into the individual pillars, sometimes it's helpful to say, 'Okay. What do we think is more important? You know, this one right here or this one. So that's how you can literally begin to stack rank.
the difference. Key initiative ideas, right? Just by going through and moving them around. Now, once you've done this enough times, you're going to find that there are a couple of them that are sort of on the outside looking in. There's a couple of key initiatives that they just don't fit within a particular pillar. That's fine. All right. A couple of things that can happen with these. Sometimes you're looking and go, you know what? This is just... Not something we need to do now. We're not going to trash it, but we're going to say... This one is going to happen later. Sometimes you're going to see that there are key initiatives. This one isn't really anything new. Like, this is just kind of your job, Bill.
So we don't need to put this one up here, right? We can kind of take this one down because that's just something you do anyway. It's an open project, but it's an ongoing one. It isn't anything new. What we're mostly focusing on is the new stuff. And sometimes you're going to find that there are things where you go. God, these right here are important. They don't really fit. We're not going to ignore them. They need to probably find their way on somewhere, but let's just acknowledge they don't necessarily fit, but they are critical. OK, so all those things can happen. What we're looking for, though, is— we're looking to begin to group ideas to the best of our abilities in general. Three. We've got these three pillars.
If we've got, you know, a half a dozen at most kind of key initiatives underneath that, we're starting to get a general sense of what are our priorities. Moving into this particular quarter. So once you've done this, once you've got them kind of drafted and laid out, congratulations, you have brainstormed both your strategic pillars and your key initiatives. You're now ready to move on to the next step. So the next step, once we've gone through the process of that initial just brain dump. right? We got all the things that everybody generally believes need to get done. Now you're going to go in and begin to brainstorm your success metrics. Now those success metrics are the particular metrics that we're going to focus on this quarter. This is where I would really encourage you.
Go back and open up your company's scorecard. And hopefully, at this point, you have created a company scorecard. So go back and open up and just review your company's scorecard and get a sense of what are the metrics that are right. Right? Because, probably, a lot of the metrics that are red, if they're important, those might be metrics that maybe they should make the list. Also, Once you've kind of begun to think about your key initiatives, saying, 'What are some of the metrics that we believe?' Like, so we want to launch these products. Why? Why do we want to do it? We can't just do it because we want to work more. Why? Why are we going to do this? What metrics are we trying to move?
So what we're seeking to do in this step is just kind of brainstorm and activate in our minds. If we do these activities, what... you know, what changes would we expect it to make, you know, with regard to our key metrics, those key performance indicators, right? So it's just worth... Looking at your current company scorecard. Because remember, the idea of this is not to necessarily come up with new metrics that should be tracked. We're thinking about, of the metrics that we're already looking at, which ones deserve... particular emphasis this quarter. All right. Now, similar to the previous step, what we have here is an exercise to help you brainstorm your success metrics. Again, you have this slide here that would come up on the screen and you would say, 'Okay, everybody, like we did last time, let's do a brain dump.' All right, let's do a Brained Up.
Let's take five minutes, and I just simply want you to write one idea for a Post-it Note. What metrics do we need to focus on and/ or optimize to achieve our Q2 goals? Again, the exact quote is on the screen. Right? The exact one is on the screen. Also, it's worth looking at the metrics that were there the previous quarter, right? What were those? Are there any of those should be pulled over? Okay, so everybody is going through. They brainstormed all of their different success metric ideas. Going nuts. They're all over the place. You go through the same exercise that we did last time. Okay, Bill, why don't you go up? You know, why don't you go first? I said this one. I said this one. Who agrees? Yep, I had that too.
You're doing the same type of voting mechanism. Right? And you're generally getting an idea of what the people believe should be tracked. What are the metrics that everybody generally believes we should be focusing on for this quarter? Now, once you've done that, something interesting will happen. Sometimes somebody will present a metric idea. That you hadn't thought about and you're like, 'Oh, that is a good one.' But we don't really have any key initiatives up here that would move that. But yeah, we definitely need to do this. So that's why this next step, this new idea step, you would say, okay, let's just take 10 minutes before we move forward. Right before we move forward, let's take 10 minutes and I just got to ask, does anyone have any other ideas for projects or initiatives that could affect this metric?
Either that, we have, or that we haven't yet identified. So this is kind of that 'speak now or forever' moment in the meeting. We brainstormed key initiatives. We leveraged these key initiatives, plus what we already knew to be true, to inform. Success metric ideas. We now have a general idea of, like, yep, these are the metrics that we absolutely positively want to move now. Does anybody have any new ideas? Has this whole metrics discussion... triggered any additional ideas? 4T. You know strategic pillars, initiatives, stuff that we got to do to move these if not, then we're basically set. Okay, deal. Now the next step. Can take a little bit of time and it just varies from company to company. Once you've established the success metrics that you need to move, it's important just to take some time.
This can take about an hour to just run the numbers. To just run the numbers to say, okay. If we were to move this metric here from where it is right now to where we believe it should be, what impact would that have on the business? If we were to do these things, what impact would that have? Do we believe it would have on those metrics? It's important that you go through this step just to test your assumptions. Okay, you got to go through the steps just to generally test the assumptions. It's sort of like a dry run. Right, okay, so. We execute these projects that increase the number of leads that we're getting every month from 1,000 to 2,000.
Okay, so if we've done that, the additional like 2,000 leads, how many sales calls should that turn to? Well, it should turn to this many more. Okay, great. How much revenue will that generate? Okay, it will generate this much revenue. Okay, will that allow us to achieve our quarterly revenue targets that we had in our 12Q plan? Yes or no? Right. That's just kind of the exercise that we're going through at this stage again. It would take about an hour to do that. And then the last step is what we refer to as the gut check. All right, the gut check question. So once you've gone through all of this entire process, you would ask this question. The slide comes up. And you would say, okay, everybody.
Do we have any reason to believe we can accomplish all of these initiatives this quarter in enough time to realize the benefits? What bandwidth, budget, knowledge, or skills gaps have we failed to consider? It's basically just a way of saying, 'All right, everybody.' Are we just pie in the sky at this moment? Right or is it true if we do all of these things? We're going to achieve. These targets, we're going to be able specifically. to go from this actual to this target. We're going to close this gap. If we do these things, we'll close this gap. We're going to get them. We're going to achieve these targets. And we know because we ran the numbers, we know that by closing that gap, it's going to get us closer to our quarterly revenue targets.
Are we good? Did we think about everything? It's that last kind of gut check question. Once you have gone through these steps, once you have fully brainstormed your pillars, you've fully outlined the success metrics that you know are going to make the difference, you've run the numbers, so you've got a sense of how this is going to work, and you've asked the gut check question once you've done all these things. You're ready to move on. We're coming down the home stretch. All right, don't give up now. I'll see you in the next step. All right, so the process that I just went through there is what we refer to as a bottom-up planning method. So we started with the key initiatives.
And the key initiatives essentially inform the success metrics, which, as you'll soon see in a second, those begin to inform the theme. All right, we haven't got to the theme yet, but... They'll kind of inform the theme. The other way you could do it is top-down. So top-down, sometimes you'll come into this meeting and everybody will generally know. We've got to move this number. And the success metrics, the gaps that need to be closed, the targets that need to be hit, they will inform the project. So we can go both ways. I found it still is better off to do the brain dump. But just know that these can move in multiple directions and, while I'm kind of presenting it here in a linear fashion, don't be surprised if, when you're facilitating this as well, you find that you're bouncing around just a little bit.
That's totally okay. All right, so now, before you go through and actually finalize your quarterly sprint plan, you need to really pause here and go back to your bottleneck and opportunity list. So we like to pause here and just do what we call the B &O review. All right, and so this is a really simple process, and maybe there's a chance. If everybody's been super aligned and super focused, you could have almost nothing. On that, like, bottleneck and opportunity list, but we don't want to move forward until we've addressed it. Right, because if somebody had a pet project, a really critical idea, if we move forward and seek to finalize before we've addressed what's on that list. One, you could potentially miss a really big idea, but two, you could just alienate somebody in your team.
I don't think you want to do either of that. Now, I recommend starting with the bottlenecks first, right? So you would simply say, 'Okay, before we finalize this team, let's go and look at our bottlenecks and opportunities.' First, let's take a look at the bottlenecks. We'll do the opportunities first. And you would simply go through this review process. Okay. You would go through this process of reading. So step number one. Okay, everybody. Take one minute to review the list. So you're just going to pause, and I would encourage you. Put a minute on the clock, absolute silence, okay? Everybody take a minute. Look at it. A minute seems like a really long time, but it's important. Are there any questions? Does anybody need any additional clarity? Right, is there something that's up?
On this flip chart, is there something that's on the B &O list that you're like, I don't remember what that is? Any additional clarity? Just want to take a moment to review it, make sure we're talking about the same thing then. We're going to reduce and prioritize. So first, kill. Alright, what should be removed? Sometimes things are removed because people realize, okay, that's already been addressed over here. We talked about that. It's been addressed. Sometimes it can be killed because you realize that, in the context of everything else, just get it gone. Sometimes somebody says, I think that should wait. Okay, but just have that discussion. What should we remove from the list? What can we just X off? What should we combine, right?
Is there anything on the list, any issues that really they can be combined with other issues? And then finally, what do we need to keep? What do we absolutely positively need to process? You'd be surprised when you go through this together, a list of like eight, 10, 12 things can turn into a list of three. Pretty quickly and easily so you want to go through that step. The next step is to actually process through the issues when you process through the issues. I would simply put these questions up on the screen. So first of all, we're going to start with issue number one, this one right here on the top. Who has a really strong opinion? Does anybody have a particularly strong opinion? It's important that you start there.
Usually it's the person who wrote on the board, but you want to find out— does anybody have a particularly strong opinion? So Bob says, yes, I have a very strong opinion. Great. What is it? I think we should do this. Awesome. Thank you, Bob. Now, who has an opposing opinion? Does anybody disagree with Bob? This is super important because I've been in meetings before, I've led meetings before, where we talked for 30, 45, an hour long. And nobody actually disagreed. So people are like... Like, we need to do this. There are people like, I agree. And we're going back and forth and talking about stuff. And finally, I was like, wait a minute. So does everybody agree that we need to do this? Yeah. And why are we still talking about it?
Let's just do it. Right? So you want to ask, does anybody disagree? Now, Thank you. If there's no disagreement, you can say, okay. It sounds like everyone's on the same page. So what I'm hearing is that the solution is as follows. You repeat out the solution that you heard. If everyone's in agreement, what do we need to do next? Okay, so if there's no general disagreement, you can kind of move on. If there is, you know, disagreement... then you can say, okay, let's talk about it, right? Who has an opposing perspective? Now, so you've asked, who has a strong opinion? Who has an opposing perspective? We have two sides that have been heard. Great. Who has something to add that hasn't been said? It's so important.
Who has something to add that hasn't been said? Because very often people want to add things that have already been said. That's not necessarily helpful. So, and you'd say, who would like to propose a solution? In light of everything that's been talked about. Who would like to propose a solution more times than not? It's the person who had the strong opinion. Very often, it's the person who had the opposing opinion and maybe they begin to agree. Who's my brave person who's willing to come forward and propose a solution? Would anybody like to propose an opposing solution? And I want to say, These questions that are on the slide that you would have up, I would have them there for everybody to see the entire time so they could begin to anticipate.
And then he's saying, Who's going to render a verdict? Is anybody willing to break the tie? Is anyone willing to say it? Now, as the leader. If you're the leader, if you're the facilitator, if you're the... highest paid person in the room, so to speak, ultimately it's up to you to break the tie. It's going to be on you. But I think it's far better if the team can reach some general sense of consensus. But if they can't—don't just kick the can. A decision must be reached. Somebody had a strong opinion. Somebody had a strong opposing opinion. They talked about it. Do not, do not, do not kick the can. All right, make the decision that we're going, it could be we've decided we're not going to do anything this quarter.
That's fine. We will leave this on the list. We can pick it up next quarter. But don't just let it sit there, okay? Now. Next thing you say, all right, last chance. And you'd go through that, by the way, everything I just said, that process would follow for every bottleneck and every opportunity. All right, you process through all the bottlenecks, you process through all the opportunities. Say okay. Great. I'm glad we talked about all that stuff. Now, last chance, do any of the bottlenecks or opportunities that we just discussed. Suggest a change to our theme, success metrics, strategic pillars, basically. Anything we just talked about doesn't change anything that we've done over here so far. Yes or no? What do we got?
And if the answer is, yeah, I think it does, okay, well then you kind of got to go back to the drawing board. 99 times out of 100, the answer is going to be nope. I think we're good. Okay, great. Let's move on. All right, so as we come to the end, remember, we have done a lot of brainstorming, a lot of mind dumping, a lot of... hopefully healthy. uh, arguing. um We've got a plan. It is now time to finalize the theme and pillars and prioritize those key initiatives. So what I would encourage you to do is basically take what we've done up here. Now, we haven't necessarily finalized a theme yet. You know, leading up to it, very often you'll see somebody be like, 'I think our theme should be this.' So perhaps over here you've written in a couple of theme ideas.
This would be the time. If you haven't done so yet, this would be the time to say, 'Okay, I think our theme should be this,' or better yet, who's willing to propose the theme? So you propose the theme. That gets written in. We're clear on all of our metrics, right? And I'll also say this. There's a good chance that at this point... All we need to know is what is the metric that we're tracking. We don't have to know the actual yet or the target or the gap in general. Okay, we can know it in general, but we don't have to know it exactly. That can be... you know, for the next step of the process. We know our theme. We know the metrics that we're going to place particular emphasis on.
We've got our Strategic Pillars decided. We have our key initiatives up there. Now what we simply want to do is go back and begin to prioritize those key initiatives. Which ones are we going to green light and win? Now, we leverage a very simple project board in Trello that there should be a link to our template and a video showing you how to use that. You could use anything, though. All right. Any type of project management tool. But this is basically when you're going to take what was scribbled up here. You're going to finalize it on the actual quarterly sprint planning canvas that we have provided to you. And all of the projects that are up here. Need to find their way in some type of project management solution.
Even if it's just another whiteboard. But they need to get up and they need to get prioritized. So once you have finalized your quarterly sprint plan in Canvas, once you have prioritized the key initiatives that are due to be completed so we know when, generally, who? Now you're able to move on to one of the final steps, finally close out this part. Alright, so at this point, you have been together facilitating this all day. Everybody's probably a little bit tired. Everybody might be a little bit cranky. That's okay. That's a part of this process. But you can't just say, 'Okay, great, we figured out a quarterly plan. Let's go.' All right. We need to just do a very quick operating system audit now. Ideally, this is very very very quick.
But what you can do is you're gonna pop up this slide on the screen and you're gonna ask this question: In light of the plans we have set today, What changes, if any, need to be made to our company's operating system? All right, in light of all the stuff we did today, what changes, if any, need to be made to our company operating system? Let's think about our scorecards. All right. And so you start with the scorecard. What changes need to be made to our North Star metrics? If you recall, the company scorecard has metrics by team, and then at the top, there are those North Star metrics. Well, what are the North Star metrics? The North Star metrics are these. These are your primary flagship success metrics.
If nothing else, you need to say, 'Yep.' We need to update our company scorecard, get those success metrics in the North Star area. Maybe there's some other team metrics that'll wind up changing. Your team can decide that, but in general, we're good. We can move forward. All right, what about our value engines? All right, and the question you would ask here, and again, it's on the screen. Just read the words on the screen. Do we need to add a new value engine or make substantial changes to an existing value engine? All right, based on all these processes, are we adding a new one, making some changes? Now, sometimes the key initiatives are going to result in the creation of a new value engine. So you say, 'Yeah, of course we will.' This one over here.
That is us creating a new value engine. Okay, great. So we're going to add a new one. No changes to existing now. Great, we can move on. All right, our HOT canvas, that high output team canvas, are there any critical changes in personnel or responsibilities? As a result of this, have we decided that we're going to be... moving anybody to a different team, a different role. Somebody getting a promotion, a demotion, a termination, right? Probably you didn't decide that here. Hopefully that was decided a different time, but in general. Have there been a significant change of responsibility with respect to the team that would change? The areas of accountability, those key areas of responsibility. On our High Output Team Canvas. And then... Lastly, The Clarity Compass.
Did we fundamentally alter our 12Q plan? Strategic anchors, value or purpose? That we fundamentally offer. Now, this is delivered in an area of things that are most likely to change from quarter to quarter, namely your company scorecard, to the things that are least likely to change. So my hope, right, is that you have a clarity compass that stands the test of time and doesn't change with each and every quarterly plan. So this is a good opportunity just to reaffirm that. Nope, we're still on track. Now, sometimes what you say is, 'heck yeah,' we're making a change. We're making a change to our 12Q plan. We need to up our goals. We're so far ahead with what we're talking about here. We're going to crush the ones that we had planned for the next quarter.
So, yep, we're going to up those goals. Hopefully, that's the only change that results. Maybe you decide, you know what? As a result of some stuff we did last week, we added a new core capability, a new strategic anchor, so we can add that. But in general... The answer to this one should be nope. No change. No change at all. Still good. Let's get to work. Once you've done that, you're ready for the last, but still critically critical important step, which is: how do we go about rolling this out to everybody else on the team? Let's get to that now. All right, so as you come to the end, what you simply need to make sure to everybody in the room is, okay, remember that quarterly sprint planning process?
Well, that's step one, right? That, that quarterly planning meeting, we did it. We just did that here. Now the next step is: we need to present this to the rest of the team. So, when is our next all-hands meeting? Now, hopefully, in scheduling this meeting, you had an all-hands meeting scheduled either later on that week or very early the next week. But within a matter of days of doing this planning meeting, you want to have that next all-hands meeting where you can present to the entire company. Here's what we figured out. This is what we figured out. This is what we're doing. And you would simply show. This is kind of a working theme. These are success metrics. These are the strategic pillars and these are the key initiatives that we believe we have greenlit.
We're open to ideas and suggestions, and you would say, 'Okay, once we've decided what we're going to be covering, when are you going to share it with your team?' Now, this is so incredibly important, all right? So you need to agree on what is going to be shared and when is it going to be shared. You do not want somebody on your leadership team sharing, especially if it's a significant change that impacts another team. You do not want them sharing that prior to a leader on another team doing it. So saying, 'Okay, so.' Starting tomorrow, everybody's going to meet with their teams and share this. And that's what needs to be the first thing. So starting tomorrow, you're going to meet with your team and share this plan and share the changes.
Now, hopefully they've got a team meeting already on the books. So they would just share it at that meeting. Maybe they need to call a special meeting. Once all the teams have been shared, all the relevant information, then you do a company-wide all-hands and you share it there as well. Following that, team planning and the all-hands, that's when the teams are coming back with their own key initiative ideas, things that maybe were forgotten, things that they don't know that can get done. That's what gets pushed back up to the leadership team. So you would plan at this meeting, okay, so over the next couple of days, everybody's going to be with their team. Great. And then, you know, a week from today, we're going to do the all hands. Fantastic.
Then what we need to do is plan on gathering and meeting again once everything's come back together to say, when are we going to finalize this and say, it's good to go. Now, this entire process— from when the very first quarterly sprint planning meeting to when it is finalized— so you've announced it, got the feedback, should not take more than two weeks. Okay, ideally you can get this done over the course of a single week or starting in one week, going over to the next one. Okay, 7, 10, no more than 14 days— if you take longer than that. You're gonna be spending your entire life in planning mode. All right, so we're going with a higher frequency but shorter kinds of durations of the actual planning period.
Alright, so but the biggest thing to take away... From this section, really from... A lot of what we're talking about here. It's about clarity. Right? What's most important? What changes, if any, are we going to make? So make sure that once they've been agreed on at the leadership level, that everybody's on the same page about what is going to be communicated and when is it all going to be communicated. Set the date for that kind of final gathering when you're going to gather up again and say, 'Yep, so this looks good.' It doesn't always have to be a formal meeting if there's no big changes. But once that has been finalized, then you're ready to get to work and actually begin the sprinting process. Look, I know this was long. I know there's a lot here to do, but this meeting is quite simply the most important and impactful thing that you will do. As a leader, to align your team to achieving its goals. So I would encourage you. Go through the process. Even if it's imperfect, go through the process. You're going to be really glad you did.
