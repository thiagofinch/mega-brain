[00:00] Welcome to section five. This is all about creating market leader positioning and carving out your niche. Niche will get you rich.
[00:08] So in this section, we're going to talk about the power of a niche, defining your who, what, and why, and creating your niche tagline.

NÚMEROS: $700K (cirurgião cerebral), $300K (clínico geral)
VISUAL: Comparação lado a lado de dois profissionais médicos, destaque em valores salariais contrastantes, representação visual da especialização versus generalização
[00:30] So, the concept here, brain surgeon versus general practitioner, you know, why is the average salary of a brain surgeon 700K versus the average salary of a general practitioner 300K? It's because they're niche. It's because they're specialized.
[00:45] So I want to illustrate here if in your organization right now you're doing everything and you're a generalist, it's going to be tougher to compete. It's going to be tougher to acquire and retain top talent. It's going to be tougher to sell and you're not going to yield as much profit.
[00:59] So always be thinking about why should I be niche? Think brain surgeon versus general practitioner.
[01:05] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Examples of Niches Within the Agency Space
NÚMEROS: Não especificado
VISUAL: Título destacado, preparação para exemplos contrastantes de posicionamento de agências
[01:07] Here's some examples of niches within the agency space. Okay, I'll start with the not niche.
[01:13] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Company X is a full-service creative agency located in Fort Worth, Texas with talents in web design, video, social media, and marketing consultation."
NÚMEROS: Não especificado
VISUAL: Exemplo de posicionamento RUIM - texto genérico, múltiplos serviços listados, localização geográfica, aparência diluída e sem foco
[01:15] Okay, so Company X is a full-service creative agency located in Fort Worth, Texas with talents in web design, video, social media, and marketing consultation. The [expletive] is that? It's it's all over the board. It's it's way too much, right? You can't be great at all of that unless you have a huge company and even then it's diluted.
[01:35] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Company X - We generate and grow your customers. We are the market leader at growing revenue through e-commerce sales and lead generation."
NÚMEROS: Não especificado
VISUAL: Exemplo de posicionamento BOM - foco claro, proposta de valor específica, nicho definido (e-commerce e lead generation), linguagem assertiva de liderança
[01:37] Versus the company here, company X, we generate and grow your customers. We are the market leader at growing revenue through e-commerce sales and lead generation. Right? Do you see the difference here?
[01:49] These guys are just saying we're full service. Anything you'll do, anything you want, we'll do. From web to video to design to marketing, whatever you need, we'll come do it.
[01:57] Versus this company says all we do is grow your customers and we grow revenue only through e-commerce and lead generation. Okay?
[02:05] So now imagine if somebody is looking for lead generation and they Google Fort Worth Digital Agency and they come here or here, who's going to win that? Who's going to get the call? Who's going to get the lead? It's going to be this company, right?
[02:18] This company's not going to get that opportunity because they're too wide, right? They're they're not being niche in their positioning and it's hurting them.
[02:27] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: What Are the Benefits of a Niche? - "Inch Wide and a Mile Deep"
NÚMEROS: Não especificado
VISUAL: Lista de benefícios, conceito visual de profundidade versus amplitude, ícones representando cada benefício
[02:28] Okay. So, what are the benefits of a niche? And I love this. I always say inch wide and a mile deep.
[02:35] So, some of these things here is simplified processes. Okay. When you do one or a couple things, you become really good at it. Your processes become tighter, your delivery becomes better, you have less room for error because you're simplifying it because you do one or a couple things really well.
[02:52] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Market Leader Content Creation
NÚMEROS: Não especificado
VISUAL: Ícones de conteúdo (white papers, podcasts, case studies), representação de autoridade de mercado, exemplos de formatos de conteúdo
[02:54] The other is you have the ability, which we're going to get into, to create market leader content. So, if you become an expert at whatever it is, digital marketing, generating leads for insurance agents selling life insurance, okay, well, guess what? Over the course of several months or a year, you're going to have a lot of case studies about how you generated qualified leads for life insurance agents that's going to position you as a market leader.
[03:17] You can go write a white paper about it. You can go get more press about it. You can create a podcast about why you're the leader at doing life insurance leads for insurance agents using digital. You see what I'm getting at? The niche allows you to do that. When you're too wide, it's tough to create that market leader content.
[03:34] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Top-Notch Talent Acquisition
NÚMEROS: Não especificado
VISUAL: Comparação visual entre agência especializada vs agência generalista, ícones de talentos, representação de competição por profissionais
[03:36] Second, you want top-notch talent. Think of this if you're a leader in doing SEO for dentists. Okay? And I'm just using random examples here. That's what you do versus a company that does SEO, web design, marketing, and PR, and they're looking for the best SEO individual. Who do you think's going to win that key talent?
[03:56] The guy that's great at SEO wants to do SEO, he's going to go to the company that focuses on it, right? Niche will allow you to get better talent and retain them because they want to keep working in that key area of focus.
[04:08] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Better Delivery, Better Results, More Proof, More Profit
NÚMEROS: Não especificado
VISUAL: Lista progressiva de benefícios, cada item destacado, fluxo visual mostrando como um benefício leva ao próximo
[04:10] Better delivery. Again, back to when you have simplified processes, you can deliver faster, you can create more margin, you can over-deliver for clients because you're so good at what you do, right? Think about it. It's like working out. When you train and you condition a muscle and you do the workout over and over and over again, you just get better at building that muscle. The same thing here in your business.
[04:32] When you're niche, you get better at delivery, better results. Again, if you're focusing on one area and you're constantly optimizing it, tweaking it, this ad didn't work, this copy we'll try this copy, this button, etc. Your test ground becomes smaller, and you're constantly improving because you're doing one thing.
[04:50] More proof, you're going to have more case studies, more profit. Again, brain surgeon versus general practitioner. If I'm the best in the country at doing SEO for dentists and I have a shitload of great proven results and I have the top-notch talent, guess what? That's a premium. I can sell more. I can charge more and eventually my company will be worth more money.
[05:12] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Higher Enterprise Value
NÚMEROS: Não especificado
VISUAL: Gráfico de valor crescente, representação de avaliação empresarial, ícones de venda/exit strategy
[05:14] Higher enterprise value. You're going to hear me talk about that and intertwine it with the word value. Again, the more niche you become, especially if you're on a path that you want to sell at some point, the more niche you have and the more of these things, the higher the value of the company is going to be.

[05:48] All right, it's game time. So, now we're going to get out the one-page attack and conquer plan. We're going to start creating your who, what, and why, and I'm going to use this example. This was a former digital agency I had that I've tweaked to help frame up how you do this exercise.
[06:04] So, again, if you haven't downloaded it, download it. This is the exact template that you'll be seeing here. And let me go over this for you. And as I finish it, think about how you would frame this up.
[06:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: WHO YOU ARE - "The market leader in digital results marketing for Fortune 2000 companies"
NÚMEROS: Fortune 2000

[06:27] Okay, look at listen to that. When I say it out loud again, I'm not saying advertising. I'm not saying general marketing. I'm not saying direct response. I'm saying digital marketing. And what am I saying it for? I'm deciding who my market is for Fortune 2000 companies.
[06:44] Okay? So, I've eliminated that I'm not going after Fortune 500 companies and I'm not going after Fortune, you know, 2,000 or or one 1,000 to to to 500. I'm staying in the 2000 Fortune 2000 companies. Okay.
[06:59] Market leader, digital results marketing for Fortune 2000 companies. That's the who you are. So quickly and clearly they know I do digital results marketing for the target Fortune 2000 companies.
[07:11] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: WHAT YOU DO - "We use digital marketing, testing, and advanced analytics to generate qualified leads and sales"
NÚMEROS: 3 métodos principais (digital marketing, testing, advanced analytics)
VISUAL: Segunda seção do template, breakdown de metodologia, conexão visual com a seção anterior
[07:13] Second, the what you do. Okay, we use digital marketing, testing, and advanced analytics to generate qualified leads and sales. So, I'm taking it one level lower, and I'm defining my version of digital marketing into me only doing three things.
[07:30] Digital marketing testing and advanced analytics to generate leads and sales that rolls back up to Fortune 2000 companies. You tracking right? You see the nuances and the difference?
[07:40] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: WHAT PROOF DO YOU HAVE - "On average, our clients see 40%+ increase in qualified leads in sales via digital marketing"
NÚMEROS: 40%+ aumento
VISUAL: Terceira seção do template, estatística em destaque, símbolo de porcentagem proeminente, validação de resultados
[07:42] Okay. And then taking it a step further and this is where you're going to have to start challenging yourself. What proof do you have? Okay. So now I've made the claim digital marketing Fortune 2000 companies. I'm doing it through digital marketing testing, advancing analytics to generate leads and sales. That's my claim and my statement. But what proof do I have?
[08:03] Right? On average, our clients see 40% plus increase in qualified leads in sales via digital marketing. Right? That's a huge stat, right?
[08:12] So, think about this right now. Brainstorm. Write these things down. How many years have you been in business? How many clients do you have in your niche? What on average are the results that you're delivering?
[08:23] Listen, people buy success, they buy proof. So, if you're going to make a claim and you're going to plant a flag, you're going to create a niche, you're going to say you're great, where's the proof? Is it years in business? Is it results? Is the amount of clients, you've got to convince them of why you're great. And if you're not there yet, then you need to start taking on more accounts. And you've got to get there. You need the proof.
[08:46] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: WHY PEOPLE WANT IT - "We are the thought leaders in our space and are so confident in our results that we will work based on a pay per performance. We don't win unless our clients win."

[08:48] Okay. And then why people want it. Okay. We are the thought leaders in our space and are so confident in our results that we will work based on a pay per performance. We don't win unless our clients win.
[09:01] Okay. Think about that. That's a big claim. Okay. So now I've created this whole market leader positioning. Who you are. I clearly am in digital results marketing for Fortune 2000 companies as the audience.
[09:15] How I do it. The what you do is digital marketing testing advanced analytics to generate leads and sales. What proof why you should work with me? On average I generate 40% higher than other agencies leads and sales and I'm so confident that you want it that I'll do it on a pay per performance.
[09:33] Okay? Do you see how I framed all that up? That becomes your new pitch, right? That becomes repeatable. Everybody in your organization should be able to answer this question. Every client should be getting this pitch.
[09:45] Now, you have to make it your own. And I'm not suggesting everybody does pay per performance, but why people could one, it could be a multitude of different ways, okay? But it's key that you frame these things up the way that I've presented it here to make you more niche and to position you as the market leader.

[10:26] Who you are, what you do, what proof do you have, why people want it. And if it's too broad, you're not there yet. And if you don't have a strong enough proof, bounce this off a potential client. Run it past them to see. And this is something as you grow and as you build, you'll continue to refine, but you always have to have it.
[10:45] Okay, stop. Put a timer on. Make it an hour. Go fill this out. And I'll see you in the next section.
