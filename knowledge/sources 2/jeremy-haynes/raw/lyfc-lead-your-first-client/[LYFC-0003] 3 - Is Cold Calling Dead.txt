Transcrição Completa: Is Cold Calling Dead?

[00:00]
"People ask me all the time, is cold calling dead? I answer very directly. It's not dead. It's simply ineffective stacked against other cold pitch mediums that you could be using."

[00:13]
"I found in my personal experience and my sales team's experience, meaning people like me who have the level of confidence I have and brand new sales guys coming into my business, as soon as they learn how to do my perfect cold video pitch, their probability of closing sales and getting responses every time they send that video off goes through the roof exponentially comparatively to cold calling people and interrupting their day over the phone."

[00:40]
"Especially my voicemail on my phone, this is for you says, 'Hey, it's 2018. It's 2019. If you're a real person and not a robo dollar, just shoot me a text. Probably call you right back, but shoot me a text. I'm probably doing something. Okay, I gotta go. Bye.' People text me right after that."

[01:00]
"My point is, business owners are the same way, guys. They are doing something and cold calling, trying to go through the gatekeeper, trying to have a script that you're pitching off every time. It's wildly ineffective and inefficient comparatively to showcasing the value on a custom basis for what you're going to do for somebody and sniping your perfect clients."

"Cold calling is like taking a shotgun that you're not even aiming in the general direction of your client that you're trying to hit and just pumping it all over the place trying to get some deals closed. Meanwhile, you're expensing much more time, energy, and attention than the people who are going deep instead of wide. Okay?"

[01:48]
"Focus. Take the 50 caliber sniper approach. Build your perfect list of ideal customers that you actually want to work with. Build a video pitch for each one of them showing what you could really do to help them in their business drive leads and sales."

"The best metaphor I have for you is, would you rather get in a car with the emergency brake pulled and choose to try to get to 120 miles an hour, or would you rather get in a car that has the right tire pressure, that's been well-maintained, has nice oil, and it's an exotic vehicle that can drive 0 to 20 in a much faster period of time."
