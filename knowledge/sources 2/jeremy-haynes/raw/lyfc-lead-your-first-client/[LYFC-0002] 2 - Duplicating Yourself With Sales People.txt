Transcrição Completa: Duplicating Yourself With Sales People

[00:00] Whether you're first getting started, you're scaling up your business, one of the greatest things you could do is duplicate yourself into salespeople, a lot of the questions revolving around how to do that or where to get them, what to do once you do get them, how to commission them properly, and in addition to that, how to inspire them as a leader.

[00:20] So, I'm going to go over these four questions centrally inside of this video, duplicating yourself in a sales guys.

[00:27] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Where to Find Salespeople"

NÚMEROS: Não especificados neste momento

VISUAL: Título principal sobre recrutamento de vendedores, layout introdutório

[00:29] Number one, where do you find them? Well, there's tons of places you can run ads on all the famous job boards. Uh, you can go to monster.com. Uh, you can do job job boards on Craigslist or Common. You can post on your personal Facebook profiles. You could tap your friend network for friends of those friends who are hustlers.

[00:50] You could go to places where there are already salespeople likely in lowpaying jobs. For example, all retailers usually have cell phone kiosks inside of them. They'll potentially have direct TV representatives, both of which I was in the past. By the way, you'd also have all kind knife people.

[01:08] You know, you going to Costco, maybe you got the Ninja blender people there, the whatever the other one that's all expensive is. Vitamix. You want to get people who you can tell are hustlers who have a lot of energy, don't necessarily know where to place it.

[01:24] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "College Campuses Strategy"

NÚMEROS: Não especificados

VISUAL: Estratégia de recrutamento em universidades, ícones de campus universitário, conceito de prospecção direta

[01:26] College campuses, such a great place for this, especially if you're direct as a millennial and you print off a nice opportunity sign on a piece of paper and go and just plaster it all over the campus. Hand it out to people, you know, get serious about scaling your business. Execute on some of these ideas I just mentioned.

[01:45] Finding those people quite simple. It's more about qualifying the people once you find them.

[01:51] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Qualification Tests"

NÚMEROS: 3 tipos de testes mencionados

VISUAL: Três categorias de avaliação: EQ Tests, IQ Tests, Personality Tests, layout comparativo

[01:53] I'm a big believer in EQ tests, IQ tests, and personality tests. There's all kinds of different studies that show personality tests might not work if you're in the Carl Jung psychology bucket, but there's always two sides to every coin. Depends on which personality test that you're using.

[02:10] Disc assessments can be great. I like to rely on a company called Culture Index.

[02:16] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Culture Index"

NÚMEROS: Não especificados

VISUAL: Logo ou referência à empresa Culture Index, ícones de CIA/inteligência, credibilidade institucional

[02:18] Culture Index is a company that was created and run by a guy who used to work for the CIA back in the day. And he has a lot of different people that helped develop his personality tests that I'm in high assurance are quite accurate.

[02:31] Long story short, with the three different tests that you can run on every salesperson that comes into your business, you'll have a better perspective of where they're at in their IQ, where they're at in their emotional intelligence, and where they're going to be at in a relative personality test, so you can use them in the best way to help scale your business and help make their dreams come true, too.

[02:51] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Salesperson Characteristics"

NÚMEROS: Não especificados

VISUAL: Características de vendedores: energia alta, comportamento esporádico, gráfico de altos e baixos emocionais

[02:53] You want to make sure that you understand salespeople should be quite hungry, but they're also going to be some of the most sporadic up and down type of people that you're going to have because they're such high energy.

[03:04] And usually depending on what type of salesperson that you bring into your business, all of that energy can both be healthy and unhealthy depending on the person's habits.

[03:13] So, to be clear, you're going to need to be a leader to these people and you're going to want to make sure that those people are ready to be led. Meaning, you want people who are seeking mentorship, seeking better opportunities in life, and overall want to develop, excuse me, overall want to develop themselves personally.

[03:31] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Commission Structure"

NÚMEROS: 15-20% comissão principal, 10% comissão recorrente

VISUAL: Estrutura de comissionamento em dois níveis, percentuais destacados, ícones de dinheiro

[03:33] When you identify the correct salesperson, you want to make sure you tell them about the money because that's what they're going to care about. Have a nice 15% to 20% commission for them. Have a nice 10% recurring commission that can go to them when they help manage the accounts that come in.

[03:50] And give them a process. You really want to build out a salesperson's day.

[03:55] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Interview Questions"

NÚMEROS: Não especificados

VISUAL: Lista de perguntas para entrevista: experiência passada, histórico de vendas, renda mensal, objetivos financeiros

[03:57] When you're going through the interview, ask them about their past experience. Ask them about what sales jobs they've worked before. Ask them about how much money they've been making on a month-to-month basis, if you can do that inside of your state, depending on laws.

[04:11] And also make sure you ask them about what their financial goals are, what they want to materialize in their life, what kind of things they want.

[04:18] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Salesperson Motivation Profile"

NÚMEROS: Não especificados

VISUAL: Ícones materialistas: carros, casas, roupas, dinheiro, representação de objetivos tangíveis

[04:20] I find sales people are the most materialistic driven people out of anybody that you could have in your agency when you're first starting off or scaling up. Meaning, they want cars, they want houses, they want nicer clothes, you know, they want a lot of money.

[04:35] And that's great to be in that specific position, especially when you want those types of things because that is one of the highest paying positions in your agency. It's also one of the best positions to be in. You want to make sure that you articulate this the right way.

[04:49] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Case Study: Leo Guran - First Sales Guy"

NÚMEROS: 2-3 meses de operação da agência no momento da contratação

VISUAL: Estudo de caso, linha do tempo, conversão de empreendedor potencial para vendedor

[04:51] Back in the day, my first sales guy ever that I turned into my VP of sales today, his name is Leo Guran. Leo came to me and he was like, you know, Jeremy, I think I want to start my agency. And I was just maybe two, three months into running my agency at the time.

[05:08] And he was like, you know, I'm thinking about starting my agency. What, you know, what should I do? Should I do it? And I was like, you know, no. I mean, you should probably come work for me.

[05:17] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Sales Position Benefits"

NÚMEROS: Não especificados numericamente

VISUAL: Comparação visual: vendedor vs proprietário, lista de benefícios, menos responsabilidades destacadas

[05:19] It's probably going to be easier for you because you're just going to do the selling. And let me be clear, selling is great. You know, you make all the money, you get the commission from it. Although it's not a salary job and it's just commission, it's still incredible because it's very predictable.

[05:35] You know, the amount of people that you pitch to equals the probability of you being able to get more deals closed. And my team and I, we're great at delivering for the deals that are closed.

[05:44] So, long story short, you'd be in the best position. You don't have to deliver. You don't really have to deal with running the business itself, which is also a pain in the ass. You don't have to deal with the tax liability. You don't have to deal with all the business liability.

[05:57] And on top of that, I'm the one that has to expense everything else and be in control of the business overall. I'm the operator.

[06:03] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Sales = Best Position in Agency"

NÚMEROS: Não especificados

VISUAL: Destaque para posição de vendas, ícones de dinheiro e lazer, comparação de benefícios

[06:05] So, long story short, when you're in the sales guy's position or the sales girl's position, you're in one of the best positions you could be in within the business. And you're really making the most money out of anybody and one of the most leisurely jobs. So, it's probably the best thing you could do.

[06:20] And it made a ton of sense to my sales guy. It made a ton of sense to me, too. And I got I got my first sales guy at that point. This was somebody who lived in San Antonio and still does today. Whereas I was in Miami at the time.

[06:33] And long story short, the best part of this, he's still with me today.

[06:37] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Sales Team Scale"

NÚMEROS: 12-13 vendedores simultaneamente

VISUAL: Gráfico de crescimento de equipe, números de vendedores ao longo do tempo

[06:39] I've had up to 12, sometimes 13 different salespeople at one time in my agency, depending on the time of year and how much money I wanted to make at that given time, specifically with my agency.

[06:51] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Quality vs Quantity"

NÚMEROS: Não especificados

VISUAL: Balança comparativa: qualidade pesando mais que quantidade

[06:53] Now, to be clear, when you are hiring salespeople, it's not about quantity. It is about quality.

[06:59] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "The 33% Law"

NÚMEROS: 33% excelentes, 33% ruins, 33% temporariamente bons

VISUAL: Gráfico de pizza dividido em três partes iguais, cada seção com características distintas

[07:01] And you'll end up having the 33% law realistically apply to you. What I found is 33% of the salespeople that I had, they stuck really well. They were great people. I could develop them. I could mentor them. They were very revenue driven and they were very goal oriented.

[07:18] You know, they would role play. Uh they would abide by policies and just general principles of the company. And they had great culture. They aligned and really fit in with everybody.

[07:28] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "The 33% Duds"

NÚMEROS: 33% categoria ruim

VISUAL: Ícone de burro/donkey, representação visual de baixo desempenho, energia negativa

[07:30] Another 33% of them were absolute Uh they had no ethics. They had no work ethic. More importantly, they had no drive. It was like a donkey, you know? You had to you beat a donkey to get it to move. it doesn't really do anything that you tell it to do or lead it to do instead.

[07:48] So, I found it a little tough with 33% of the staff that would come in.

[07:52] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "The 90-Day Burnout Pattern"

NÚMEROS: 33% categoria temporária, 90 dias de produtividade

VISUAL: Gráfico de desempenho ao longo do tempo: subida nos primeiros 90 dias, depois queda acentuada

[07:54] Whereas another 33%, they would be great for about a 90-day period of time and then they'd be complete duds. It's is almost as if they heard of that that there's great salespeople for 90 days that then die out and they lived that life themselves.

[08:08] Meaning, they would have high levels of productivity, high amounts of discipline and daily determination to go close some deals. They'd be following up. They'd be following best practices. They'd make a little bit of money and then they'd kind of burn out.

[08:22] They'd stop closing deals because they either made too much money and got too over the top in themselves and stopped keeping their eye on the prize or even worse, they just flat out had a high level of productivity and then just dropped off for other unknown reasons.

[08:36] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Outflow = Inflow Potential"

NÚMEROS: 33% taxa de retenção

VISUAL: Equação visual, funil de entrada e saída, fluxo constante de recrutamento

[08:38] So, if 33% of your sales people stick, it's the same thing. Outflow equals inflow potential, right? You got to have more sales people, but you got to do it in a healthy way.

[08:49] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Mass Hiring Case Study: 12 People at Once"

NÚMEROS: 12 pessoas contratadas simultaneamente, 11 permaneceram inicialmente

VISUAL: Layout de caso extremo, múltiplas pessoas, cenário de Beverly Hills

[08:51] if you take on more sales people at one time. As an example, I hired 12 people at one time. 11 of them stuck just for sales. Well, I was in a co-working space out in Beverly Hills.

[09:06] So, what I had to do, I had to put them all in the parking garage downstairs. We had to get some janky uh you know, like outside tables and just a bunch of random like beat up old office chairs.

[09:17] I had to feed them three times a day. I had to go down there and train them three times a day for one hour. One in the morning, one in the afternoon, one in the evening. I had to make sure that each one of them was taken care of.

[09:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Extreme Housing Solution"

NÚMEROS: 4 pessoas em 1 RV, 1 pessoa veio de outro estado

VISUAL: RV/motorhome, solução de moradia criativa, logística complexa

[09:32] Four of four of them I put into an RV together because they were all coming from like two hours away. One of them came from across the country.

[09:40] And to be clear, these are all great people. You know, every single person that came and participated in that I'm extremely thankful for. But it was quite interesting to see the process of what it was like to have that many people come and work for me at one time.

[09:53] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Leadership Time Drain"

NÚMEROS: Não especificados

VISUAL: Transformação de líder em babá glorificada, tempo consumido completamente

[09:55] It immediately kind of uh, you know, just took all my time away from me and put me into a glorified babysitter position.

[10:02] And on top of that, the 33% law applied. So 33% of them stuck. 33% of them were and 33% of them were good for a bit, but it wasn't over 90 days. It might have been a few weeks that they were good.

[10:16] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Infrastructure Costs"

NÚMEROS: 3 escritórios totais (1 terceiro escritório adicional para vendedores)

VISUAL: Múltiplos espaços de escritório, custos crescentes, expansão física necessária

[10:18] Now, when I also had that many people at one time, it required me to expense a lot more money. I ended up having to get a third office just for the sales guys to go into because there were so many of them.

[10:30] And because we were so loud, we were constantly doing video pitches both on the computer and on phones and of course on on sales calls.

[10:38] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Office Space Requirements"

NÚMEROS: Não especificados

VISUAL: Requisitos de espaço físico, níveis de volume alto, necessidade de isolamento acústico

[10:40] So long story short, sales guys, especially if you have them in person, they require office space. they require you to likely have your own office space or at least a place that you can operate with a high frequency of volume around uh which sometimes can, you know, disturb the piece depending on where you're at and where you're operating.

NÚMEROS: Não especificados

VISUAL: Expansão de mentalidade financeira, limite de crenças vs potencial real

[11:25] I find that even my greatest salespeople have hit that point where they make whatever amount of money that they thought was a lot and then I have to expand their mentality to really understand what is a lot of money.

[11:37] Otherwise, they'll have that mentality that they made enough and then they'll kind of fizzle out until they run out of money and need to make more.

[11:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Reward-Based Incentives"

NÚMEROS: Não especificados
