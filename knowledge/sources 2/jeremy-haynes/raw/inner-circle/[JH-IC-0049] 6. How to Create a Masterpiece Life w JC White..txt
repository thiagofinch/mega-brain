So a lot of people don't understand the differences between these things and what it actually is. Okay. So if we think of DNA testing versus blood work, DNA testing is more biological. Okay. If you think of it in business terms, it's the structure of your business. What actual business are you running? Okay, that cannot change."
[03:48] "Your blood work is kind of like your KPIs. Looks in real time actually what's going on in your business. You can adjust your KPIs, but you cannot adjust your DNA. Does that make sense?"

So, we can see huge increases in energy, see huge increases in performance, and see huge increases into your output. If you're not doing this stuff on a on at least two to three times or four times per year, looking at your blood work and adjusting your nutrition and supplementation from there, I guarantee you're leaving money on the table.

There's other markers and other things that are really important and critical to this."
[04:55] "For one, what is the actual optimal range of testosterone that's going to be solely person dependent, okay? And we have to look at different markers. Some of them are called free testosterone. Other ones are called sex hormone binding globulin because that's going to help us understand what your body's actually utilizing for these things such as focus, drive, performance, muscle mass, strength, and bone health.

But when it comes to the things that help to support that, we don't have anything. We have no vision. We have no intentionality."
[07:25] "And we've been taught to compartmentalize these things. But really, life is just one. It's a whole. And when we are not in alignment, I guarantee you when one of these falls off, it's going to affect your bottom line. And we all just recognize that if our relationship goes to shit our attention gets off of our business. If our mental health goes to shit our attention gets off our business."
[07:48] "And the fitness one's pretty easy. If you're not healthy, if you're not feeling good on a day-to-day basis, you're not going to be able to perform at elite level in your business. Does that make sense? Cool."

So one we already have it done for business. Now we have to start to do it for your fitness. We have to start to do it for your relationships. And then we have to have goals for your mental and your spiritual health."
[09:20] "Story time for you guys. So in few years ago, my business really started to scale. We really started to take off during that time period. Um I broke up with my ex-girlfriend. Things just weren't working out, kind of growing apart. Um I was changing and growing, developing as a person."
[09:40] "And I had set up the business in a way where I really didn't have to do much. I had a front-end sales team. I had a front-end setters. I had coaches to do all the fulfillment. I was just sitting back rolling in the money because my vision at that time was not big enough. I already hit my goal."
[09:58] "So what does a man do without a vision? That was flying chicks from all around the country come and see me. I had a girl every single day of the week. I don't know why that's a flex in our society. It was terrible at the time, but when I think about it now, it's actually kind of funny."
[10:15] "Have you guys ever fucked a random and then went into the bathroom and cried? Shit's empty as fuck. Empty. And I knew at that time that if this was all I was going to see for my life, I was ultimately going to self-destruct."
[10:30] "Yeah, for sure. I knew I was ultimately going to self-destruct and I knew the vision had to get bigger and I knew that there was other contributing factors to ultimate success cuz like I was saying like you guys realize relationship goes to shit so does business go to shit. So as we were scaling started to do this. Why do you think it's obvious, right? My attention went elsewhere. The energy went elsewhere."
[10:55] "So, having these being intentional about every other area of your life is only going to help to amplify everything. So life is like a mirror. I say as within so without. Your outer world is just a reflection of your inner world. And I know that may sound a little woo woo and foofy. But trust me, if we're not doing this self-development on ourselves, if we're not taking every other area of our life seriousness, it's going to limit your potential when it comes to getting this money. It will. I guarantee it."

We have the business and finances, right? Super easy to develop KPIs around that, but we have our relationships."
[11:45] "How do we define something that's qualitative in nature? So, you say you want to get closer with your wife, we have to break that down exactly what that means. If you're in a relationship with somebody, right, and you have a girlfriend and you want to get closer to her, does that mean you want to get engaged by the end of the year? Like, what does that actually mean? Then reverse engineer that. What is that process?"
[12:05] "Does that mean we have to do two date nights per month? Okay, cool. That's what we put up there in that box there. And we make it very quantifiable about what these actions mean. If you have kids, how do you get closer with your kids? What are the actions that and steps that need to be taken to get closer with your kids?"
[12:22] "When it comes to the mental and spiritual, if you want to grow more enlightened, okay, what kind of books are you reading besides just business books and understanding how to run and operate and scale a business? What are you doing with things to improve your mindset?"

[13:20] "Cuz people think all the time of like fitness and everything like that, I need to be held accountable. I need to be held accountable. No, no, no, no. That just means you're not connected to the outcome. You can't clearly see it. You still identify as who you currently are, you have not walked into that new person."
