Transcrição Completa: How to Have it All and not self destruct with James Swanwick   [00:00]  Thank you, Jeremy. Thank you, everyone. Great to be here. I'm going to be 50 next year. And so, by virtue of the fact that I've probably got 20 more years on the planet than many of the people here in this room, I wanted to share with you guys the fact that you can have it all.   [00:17]  Health, wealth, love, and happiness simultaneously at the same time. It's amazing that we're all here and Jeremy's given us the this big G up, so to speak, to get us moving forward in our wealth and taking big risks.   [00:31]  And I want to challenge you guys to take a big risk in your happiness because in my experience, the happier you are, and to put it another way, the less unhappy you are, the greater ability to be able to create financial wealth.   [00:46]  So, I want you guys to entertain the idea that happiness is the ultimate currency.   [00:51]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Happiness as Ultimate Currency - Scientific Benefits"   NÚMEROS:  15 fewer sick days/year, significantly higher income, 10 years longer life, 12% more productive   VISUAL:  Dados científicos do National Academy of Sciences (US) e University of Warwick, estatísticas de saúde e produtividade relacionadas à felicidade   [00:53]  In fact, according to a National Academy of Sciences of the US study, happier people have an average of 15 fewer sick days a year. Imagine how much more money you guys would make if you weren't sick 15 days of the year.   [01:06]  Happier people earn significantly higher levels of income. Happier people can live up to 10 years longer. So just by virtue of the fact that you're on the planet 10 years longer than anyone else, you can make more money.   [01:19]  Happier people are 12% more productive according to a University of Warick study.   [01:24]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Wheel of Life Assessment"   NÚMEROS:  Scores de 1-10 em diferentes áreas (exemplo: Family 9-10/10, Money 10/10, Health variável, Career 3/10, Personal Growth 2/10, Friends 1/10)   VISUAL:  Diagrama circular dividido em seções (saúde, riqueza, amor, felicidade, crescimento pessoal, família, carreira, amigos), comparação visual entre roda equilibrada vs desequilibrada   [01:26]  Anyone know what this is? A wheel of life. It's like if we break it down into health, wealth, love, happiness, personal growth. And some of us may feel on this example that our family life is at a nine or a 10 out of 10. Our money is at a 10 out of 10, our health.   [01:43]  But look on this example here. The career might be like a three out of 10. The personal growth might be a two out of 10. The friends might be a 1 out of 10.   [01:51]  And when your wheel of life is like this, where you have strong wealth but not much health, or strong health and not much wealth, and so forth, it's kind of like trying to ride a bicycle that's got a punctured wheel.   [02:03]  Or it would be one of us going out into the driveway here and putting diesel fuel in one of Jeremy's Ferraris or Rolls-Royces. Right? when he wakes up tomorrow morning, he starts to drive. It's going to be really clunky. Life is going to be clunky if we are out of sync.   [02:19]  So, through ups and downs, two big downs, which I'm going to share with you here in my story in just a moment. Right now, as I'm standing here going into 50 next year, if I judge success by a wonderful combination of health, wealth, love, and happiness, I often feel like I'm the most successful person I know.   [02:38]  Now, I'm sure there are more there are people who make much more money, who have better health, better love life, better family life, but in terms of having it in sync, so I have a a smooth motion. Sometimes I'm just walking through life going, "Man, how did it get this good?"   [02:54]  And because I'm happy, or another way to say it is because I'm not unhappy, business grows. I attract people who can help create a big impact in the world.   [03:05]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Cautionary Tales - Success Without Inner Work"   NÚMEROS:  Sam Bankman-Fried (bilionário), Elizabeth Holmes ($6B valuation, 12 anos prisão), Will Smith (Oscar incident), Brad Pitt (casamento destruído), Travis Kalanick (CEO Uber forçado a renunciar)   VISUAL:  Fotos de celebridades e empreendedores de alto perfil que tiveram colapsos públicos, comparação entre sucesso externo e falha interna   [03:07]  Now, I don't mean happy like Sam Begman Freed here. There are cautionary tales everywhere because guess what, guys? We can make a billion dollars. And excuse my French, fuck it all up.   [03:21]  Because we didn't do the work, because we didn't face our childhood trauma, because we didn't do personal development, because we didn't understand that mommy loving us too much or not enough as a child resulted in all of this misbehaving in adult life.   [03:36]  Will Smith, amazing entrepreneur, producer, rapper, actor. He gets to the very top of the mountain five minutes before he's about to receive the highest accolade you can get in acting in entertainment. And what does he do? He walks up and he has a meltdown. He slaps Chris Rock.   [03:54]  Now, on the surface, we'd go, Will Smith, incredibly successful person. We can learn so much from him. But he hadn't done the work. I would submit that he was very unhappy in areas of his life.   [04:06]  We've got Elizabeth Holmes celebrated on the cover of Forbes magazine, $6 billion valuation, I think it was. She's doing 12 years in prison right now. Okay. Now, on the on the Forbes magazine, happy, successful, celebrated, she's now in prison.   [04:23]  Brad Pitt married one of the most beautiful women of the world arguably then and Angelina Jolie was a producer as an actor. Women all over the world wanted to be with him. Men wanted to be like him and then he goes and drinks alcohol on a flight gets drunk.   [04:38]  Puts his hand allegedly around Angelina Jolie's throat, hits his kids. Angelina Jolie files for divorce.   [04:45]  Travis Kick, former CEO Uber, launched arguably the greatest transportation company in the history of the world, and then has meltdowns, argues with an Uber driver, gets captured on video, forced to resign from the company that he created.   [05:01]  So, what I'm trying to get at here, guys, is that we can be wealthy, we can create riches, we can learn the best funnels, we can scale our advertising spend, but if we're broken inside or we haven't faced that trauma, it's going to come back and bite us in the ass big time.   [05:19]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Definition of Happiness - Survival Psychology"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Conceito psicológico de felicidade como percepção subconsciente de probabilidade de sobrevivência, teoria evolutiva de emoções   [05:21]  friend of mine's writing a book called Paradise is a state of mind and I asked him what is the definition of happiness and he said it's your subconscious perception of probability of survival. Your subconscious perception of probability of survival.   [05:37]  So humans are not designed to be happy. We're designed to survive. And anything that our subconscious believes is going to help us survive feels good to us.   [05:48]  You'll learn later on as I go through this. Some of the happiest that human beings feel, some of those moments is when we're eating food with allies. Just like today, we're here, we're eating food, and we're with friends and we're with allies because that increases our chances of survival.   [06:05]  A, we're eating food, okay? And B, we have allies. So, when the aliens come down from the heaven and start shooting us, we've got a group of guys here that we can all rally together, which will increase our chances of beating the aliens. Does that make sense?   [06:20]  So that's why we get so much pleasure from being in these masterminds because we've got allies around us.

And so if you'll allow me over the next 20 minutes or so, I just want to share with you some of the success habits and happiness habits that I learned from this array of people.   [07:23]  Now, it's going to seem like I'm flexing a little bit because I'm going to show you some photos of me and Hollywood celebrities. And at the time when I was interviewing these guys in the 2000s, Hollywood celebrities were like everything. They were today's billionaires, right?   [07:38]  Fast forward to today and to to borrow an Australian colloquialism, I couldn't give a rat's ass about Hollywood celebrities, most of them. But at the time, they were gods.   [07:48]  And I got an opportunity to interview them as they were promoting their movie or uh interview them as they were promoting their uh album. And I always made sure to ask them a question about success. What's the secret to your success? So, I'm going to share some of those.

What's his background?   [08:16]  So, I'm going to ask you to get in the Delorean and come back through time in a time machine back to about 1993. And that is me on the left, believe it or not. And uh couple years later in '95, that's me. Look at look how ancient I am. You can see the computer there. It looks like I don't know what it looks like. Looks like a refrigerator with keys on it.   [08:38]  But I was a journalist. I worked for a Rupert Murdoch owned newspaper in Brisbane, Australia. And I did that straight out of high school from age 17 until 23. And I did the traditional thing in life, which was get a job and forge your career.   [08:54]  But even at 22, 23, there was something inside me which was I need to get overseas and experience life. I got to do something different. So I made the choice to resign from that career and I went over to London.

I ended up living there for four years. Uh I was a journalist over in the UK for a time and then I made a big mistake which was I fell in love with a British woman who broke up with me and broke my heart and I used that then to book a one-way flight to Los Angeles, California in 2002.

[09:56]  I was there for a couple of months. My money was running out and I was thinking, how am I going to survive in America? How am I going to live this American dream that I keep hearing people all over the world talk about? Go to America. Live the dream.   [10:10]  I had some journalism experience. So I thought, okay, I'm going to see if I could interview movie stars. I'm living in Los Angeles.

[10:32]  One publicist at one studio, Sony Pictures, her her name was Anna Wheel and she invited me into the studio. I went there the next day. She told me how it all worked. She kind of was taking pity on me a little bit because I was this Australian journalist. I didn't have really any connections and I was living in a hostel for goodness sake. I didn't tell her that.

[11:19]  And then she said, "Would you like to interview Jack Nicholson?" I was like, "Yes, I would."

[12:20]  And then very quickly, publicists started saying, "Do you want to interview Arnold Schwarzenegger for the film Terminator Salvation? Can you interview Jennifer Aniston and and Ben Stiller for the movie Along Came Polly?   [12:32]  Now, I didn't realize I was an entrepreneur at this stage. I actually just still considered myself a journalist. But really, what was happening is that I was creating myself being an entrepreneur. I was hustling.

So essentially, I was working for Disney and I had to check in at a certain time and had to leave at a certain time. And I didn't like that. There was something inside of me that still had that entrepreneurial spirit.   [17:43]  And so I made the choice in 2012 after two years of hosting this show, hanging out with people like Magic Johnson in the ESPN cafeteria, meeting people like Tim Tibo and Meta World Peace and Reggie Bush, getting to meet my childhood idol, John Bonjovi.

And as he asked that question, who here wants to be mentored by me, $25,000? My hand kind of went up like this.   [19:46]  And I was thinking, now Jeremy's talking was talking earlier about taking a big risk. My heart was like pounding as I put my hand up because I thought, "This guy here is going to show me how to be an online entrepreneur. I know this is going to be right for me." But I didn't have $25,000 at least in my US bank account.   [20:05]  A week later, I transferred $32,000 Australian currency over to his Bank of America account and Tai mentored me, mentored me for 18 months.

[21:04]  And I thought, why don't I start a little program? So, I committed to creating this program called the 30-day no alcohol challenge. I recorded 30 pieces of content. Took me 30 days.

I'm like, "Block the blue light? What are you talking about?"   [22:00]  And then he went on to explain that all the artificial light that comes from our screens and from lights messes with our sleep, causes us to be um irritable, frustrated. The only problem was is that he looked like a meth chemist trying to block the blue light.   [22:16]  So I came up with this idea because I was just vain enough at the time living in Hollywood that I wanted to look cool of just producing a stylish pair of blue blockers. at least a pair of blue blockers that weren't ugly, like you know, you you look like a meth chemist.   [22:32]  And so my brother and I teamed up and we did some prototypes and we launched what I think at the time was the first pair of stylish blue blockers. We didn't try to invent blue blockers because they were already on the market. They were just freaking ugly. We just tried to create a stylish pair and make it a stylish brand.   [22:50]  We launched the first year we did a million dollars in sales. Just came out of the gate. It just popped. That was about the time that biohacking was starting to take off and we had a lot of success.

[23:15]  I I strategically took two pairs of Swanies glasses with me. So when uh I was hoping that Schwarzenegger would ask me like, "Why are you wearing those orange glasses?" And then I go, "Well, I actually have a pair here." So I could give it to him and then get this photo, which I did.   [23:31]  And then we used it in digital marketing until his management company contacted us and said, "Either give us like $200,000 or take it down."   [23:40]  Associating with Tai was fun. We got to go to the Golden Globes, met Elon Musk and uh Mark Cuban, and life was going pretty well, I would say, in the sense that the alcohol-free business was doing modestly well. was doing pretty well. The Swanies blue light blocking glasses was doing very well.   [23:58]  People started to go, "Oh, you're James Swanik. You're the guy with the blue blockers." And I made me feel good.

We broke up and I left and I went to this very hotel, the courtyard by Marriott in Santa Monica. I checked in for three nights. I got up, checked in, got into the bed and I literally curled up into a ball and I cried like a little girl.   [24:54]  Not because the of the end of the relationship. That was part of it.

When they learned that I was mentored by him, they would kind of cozy up to me and think that I was really cool as well.   [25:24]  And it was again, it was kind of feeding my ego. But I realized that I was chasing significance. I was envious of other people's success.   [25:33]  I would submit many of us here in this room right now are probably talking to people who are far more advanced than us in terms of the money that they make. And we might not want to admit it, but secretly we're probably envious, right? Oh, I must be doing something wrong. Everyone else is crushing it except for me. Has anyone ever felt that feeling? I can see some people nodding their heads.   [25:54]  I was irritable when my parents would phone from Australia. They'd always seem to phone at the most inopportune time. I'd be talking to friends. I'd be at a meeting. My phone would buzz. I'd check it. It's my mom. I go, "Oh, fucking hell. My mom." My dad would call. I go, "Fucking hell, my dad."   [26:10]  I was arrogant. I was pompous.

[26:48]  I did another program called Elevate Leadership Community. that I went back to Landmark a week later and did the Landmark advance course. Then I went back and did Elevate Leadership Community Advance course and that was all over about 10 to 12 weeks.

This is me when I was 6 years old. This is back in Australia. About two 3 minutes before this photo was taken, my mother came up to me and she said, "James, you're going to get up and give a speech and you're going to thank the coach in front of your rugby teammates and all the other parents and you're going to give a speech."

Everyone in Australia when I was a journalist was, "That's the greatest job ever. You stay in Australia and you get a mortgage and you marry Jenny Davies and you live happily ever after."   [28:28]  And I was like, "Society, you don't get to tell me what to do. I'm going over to London." Then my girlfriend dumped me. I'm like, "You don't get to tell me what to do." Then I move over to Los Angeles. Then I'm in Los Angeles. Like, you don't get to tell me what to do. And so forth.   [28:42]  A lot of us here are living life like that.

I went back to Brisbane, Australia. I said to my dad, who hadn't hugged me since I was 10 years old, "Hey, Dad, this is going to seem really awkward cuz I know I'm in my 40s and you're in your 70s, but we haven't hugged since I was 10."   [29:22]  And it feels weird for me to fly back from America, see you, and the first thing you do is hold out your hand and we shake hands. And it feels weird for me, Dad, that when I leave and you say, "See you, son." And I know I'm not coming back for a year or two, you hold out your hand and you shake hands.   [29:40]  So I went and met him for lunch in the Queen Street Mall, which is a mall area in downtown Brisbane. And I sheepishly said to him at lunch, I said, "Do you think like when I fly back in and when I fly out, instead of us shaking hands, we could um hug?"   [29:57]  It was super awkward. Super awkward. I mean, I grew up in Australia. My dad's like an alpha male, strong guy. Australian culture. We don't hug. We shake hands for the most part, depending on, you know, the family that you grew up in. And he looked at me and he went, "Okay."   [30:15]  And I was like, "Okay." And then I'd been watching Entourage. Anyone watched the TV series Entourage? And Ari Gold's character is always like, "You want to hug it out, bitch?" So I said to my dad, "Do you want to hug it out, bitch?"   [30:28]  And my dad looked at me cuz he doesn't watch Entourage, so he didn't know what I was talking about, but he got the notion and he went, "Okay." And then we stood up. This is in the middle of the day in downtown Brisbane and we hugged and he kind of goes gives me this really awkward tap on the shoulder and I'm kind of feeling really awkward and then we stopped the embrace, said our exchange pleasantries and I walked off and as I walked off tears started streaming down my eyes.   [31:00]  Jeremy earlier was talking about that big leap, pushing yourself. That for me was a huge leap to be able to ask my dad for a hug. That was my big risk. And I got to tell you, everything from there, from that moment has been beautiful. Health, wealth, love, and happiness.   [31:20]  All of us here can crush it in life with wealth. But if we still got these wounds from childhood, we're still envious, we're still chasing something, we're still chasing significance, we might make the money, but we're going to lose the money.   [31:35]  Or we might never make the money because we're being held back because of relationships with our parents or friends at school or stories that we're creating in our life.   [31:45]  So, I want to invite you guys to really consider what is that big leap that you can take. Not just doubling your ad spend, not just buying a house in cash, but actually going and making peace with your parents, with yourself, and leaning into personal development.

[32:23]  So anyone read Atomic Habits by James Clear? One of the big things I got from him when I interviewed him was create visual cues.   [32:32]  Now, as that relates to health, I prepare my gym clothes the night before. So, these this is a photo on the left many years ago of me preparing gym clothes the night before. So, when I wake up in the morning, I see those gym clothes. I think about the gym. I put the clothes on and the likelihood that I'm going to go and exercise increases exponentially. This is what James Clear is talking about when he talked about visual cues.   [32:58]  On the right here, we have glass mason jars. If I'm in any place for any lengthy period of time, I will buy glass mason jars, about six of them, and I'll put them around the house. Why? Because it makes me think of water.   [33:13]  So, when I see the glass mason jars, I fill it up with water and then I drink. Whereas, if I don't have the glass mason jars, I end up drinking probably five times less water throughout the day.   [33:25]  The other thing about a glass mason jar is that it has a really big mouth as opposed to these plastic bottles that we're sipping from. You know, you like have a little sip. glass mason jar, you just automatically drink three, four times more water than if you were sipping from a plastic container.

Two biggest things that I submit that you guys can do to sleep better is expose yourself to natural sunlight first thing in the morning.   [34:53]  Our skin has receptors in it and when the sunlight hits the skin, it tells our body's internal clock called the circadian rhythm, this is daytime. And what that means is our body then floods with daytime hormones. Plus, it puts on this timer that 16 hours later, your body's going to want to naturally flow with melatonin.   [35:15]  The challenge is most people here are waking up, staying indoors under fluorescent lights, not getting out, not getting sunlight, and their sleep patterns are all messed up. So, first thing in the morning, get as much natural sunlight as possible.   [35:30]  And then at night time, about an hour before you go to sleep, you want to wear a pair of quality blue blockers. I'm biased because this is my company, but whether you choose my brand or you choose another brand, wear these blue blockers in the last hour before you go to sleep.   [35:45]  To be clear, you don't go to sleep with them on. You just wear them in the last hour, remove them, and then you fall asleep. The orange lens blocks the artificial blue light that is responsible for messing with your melatonin production.   [35:58]  Wear these glasses consistently, an hour before sleep. You'll fall asleep quicker. You'll sleep deeper. You'll wake up feeling more refreshed.

Who here drinks seven drinks a week? Who here would drink one drink a day? I'm not going to chastise anyone, but who here? Okay, great.   [36:21]  So, there was a study that came out in the UK in 2022 that showed even one seemingly innocent drink per night, seven standard drinks uh a week, was still enough to cause some level of brain degeneration.   [36:35]  More specifically, gray and white matter in the brain gets destroyed when you drink alcohol because alcohol is simply attractively packaged poison.   [36:45]  Now, as an entrepreneur, you guys can remember when you were drinking, right? Drinking consistently, you're a little bit out of shape. Let's do a little mathematical equation here. Okay?   [36:56]  If you were drinking consistently, you weren't an alcoholic, but you were drinking consistently, how would you rate your performance in your business on a scale of 1 to 10? in terms of productivity, clarity, focus, making good decisions.   [37:11]  Let's think back to a time when you were drinking considerably and consistently. Would it be a six out of 10, five out of 10, seven out of 10? Someone throw up a number. Five out of 10.   [37:22]  Okay. So, let's just say you have a business that's doing a million dollars in revenue and you feel like you're a five out of 10. You sleep in some days, you're distracted, you're irritable, you don't make great choices.   [37:35]  If you then consistently go alcohol-free, what's going to happen? You're going to have more clarity, focus. You're going to sleep better. You're going to have a more positive mindset. So, you might then improve your performance up to seven out of 10 or an 8 out of 10.   [37:50]  Now, the difference could be $200,000 in additional revenue because you have that clarity and that focus and that energy. So, you can make the argument that your drinking habits in this hypothesis out of five out of 10 is costing your business $200,000 a year at least. Does that make sense, guys?   [38:09]  This is just math. I mean, we're talking here about Jeremy's giving us these great ideas to double the ad spend and put in half a million dollars for a month and scale the business. But what's the ball and chain that we've got around our ankle? In many cases, it's alcohol. In many cases, it's eating poorly. In many cases, it's not doing the inner work.   [38:30]  So, I can tell you this with the greatest amount of confidence. Your drinking habits are probably costing you guys millions and millions of dollars just because you're operating at a five or a six out of 10 when you could be operating at an eight out of 10. Right? So, just something for you guys to ponder.

Shallow work is when you're unfocused because of distraction and you keep switching context. Deep work focus without distraction. Shallow work unfocused because of distraction.

But the moment you allow someone to come in here and distract you, you're off that task. And now it takes 23 minutes for you to get back to it.

Automate it. I mean we are we are human beings we are crazy. We will not do this one basic simple thing. Money will come into one account and then we'll start spending that money on various things.

[42:20]  So the idea just to use this example this isn't a this isn't profit first example but it's a you know example of automating. Your money comes in, then you've got a savings account, a brokerage account, money that goes into a credit card, other bills, Roth IRA.   [42:35]  You ref, you heard Jeremy speak earlier about how he has an operating account, but then he siphons it off automatically. Now, what I do is I have money come in and automatically every month money goes into the US stock market, some money goes into crypto, some money goes into life insurance. It's just automated, automated, automated.   [42:55]  And I read this book called Misbehaving by Richard Thaylor. And he's a professor of behavioral economics at the University of Chicago. And he really highlighted highlighted how we just make dumb decisions when we don't automate things.   [43:09]  We got a whole bunch of money in our bank account and then we manually go and distribute it as opposed to automatically distribute it. I would highly recommend reading this book because you'll you'll understand how crazy we are.

Our digital marketing manager, Blake, here with the white shirt, just put your hand up, Blake, is running our ads at the moment. He's probably cycled through maybe 40 or 50 of my ads.   [45:48]  One of them right now is driving traffic to our VSSL, which is, I guess, in the context of the history of the business, crushing it. But we had to test 50 ads to find that one. Does that make sense?   [46:02]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "WEALTH HABITS - Hire A Players"   NÚMEROS:  7 figures (alcohol-free business histórico), 3-4 meses de crescimento acelerado recente   VISUAL:  Adrian Nichols (sales manager/strategic direction), Blake (digital marketing manager), ops manager referida por Adrian, nova social media manager, Jeremy como A-player advisor   [46:04]  Number five is uh hire a players and ensure you feel like you're always one of the dumbest people in the room.   [46:12]  So the alcohol-free business has been generally speaking a lifestyle business. It's done very well. It's made seven figures and it's done it's done well. It's been a great lifestyle business.   [46:24]  And then I teamed up with Adrian here. Adrien Nichols, you want to put your hand up? Adrien runs our sales department and sales manager and has been very influential in strategic direction of the business.   [46:37]  And Adrien is what I would describe as an A player. Blake here who sits next to him. Again, an A player. We then brought in an ops manager who Adrien referred. She's incredible. And just right from the word go, she was just on.   [46:52]  We've now got a new uh social media manager who's just on, who's obviously an A player. We are noticing in the last three or four months just the level of sophistication in our business.   [47:04]  I invested in in hiring Jeremy as an adviser. That was a big risk. Cost a bit of money. Didn't really know him, but I understood that he did well with one of our competitors. So I thought, okay, that's a risk worth taking. We consider him an A player adviser.   [47:20]  The growth, the level of growth, the speed of which we're growing now is a result of hiring A players where for years I was hiring, I guess by comparison, you might call them B, maybe C plus. Pretty good. Did a good job, but not at the level where we're at in the business now.

This is probably where I'm least uh experienced or expert in to be able to talk about, but first thing I would say is make peace with your parents. Repair those relationships.   [47:54]  We're all messed up because of our parents. Even if they gave us the greatest upbringing in our life, even if they provided a safe home and they pushed us and they were loving and they were caring, we're still messed up because of that.   [48:08]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Parental Impact Patterns"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Lista de padrões comportamentais resultantes de diferentes estilos parentais: conditional love → transactional behavior, shamed/abused → hiding true self, toxic home → explosive emotions, ignored → people pleaser, no approval → perfectionist   [48:10]  Couple of examples. If we receive praise or affection only when things were done to a parent's standard, then we tend to behave in business as if love is conditional or transactional.   [48:24]  If we were shamed, insulted, or abused when we were younger for being ourselves, we grow up hiding who we truly are. So, we end up pretending to be someone that we're not.   [48:36]  For me, that showed up pretending to be cool and happy all the time, living in Hollywood, being a great guy and having lots of friends, but inside I had this energy drip of not being as happy as I could be.   [48:49]  If we grew up in a toxic, abusive, or neglectful home environment, we can grow up to internalize emotions, so we're prone to exploding at a moment's notice. Does anyone here yell at their staff or have yelled at their staff or just lost the plot one particular day, got into an argument with their loved one? No one wants to admit they have done. Thank you. Appreciate it.   [49:11]  If we were ignored, we'd become people pleasers. If we never got our parents approval, we grow up as perfectionists.   [49:20]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "LOVE HABITS - Companionate vs Passionate Love"   NÚMEROS:  2 anos de pico para amor apaixonado, 60 anos de declínio depois, crescimento constante para amor companionate   VISUAL:  Livro "The Happiness Hypothesis" de Jonathan Haidt (NYU professor), dois gráficos comparativos de intensidade ao longo do tempo   [49:22]  Number two, consider marrying or partnering for companionate love versus passionate or romantic love. There's a great book called The Happiness Hypothesis by Jonathan Height. One of the top three books I've ever read. Incredible book. He's a professor out of New York University.   [49:41]  And if you look on this graph here, the the uh the broken graph, the one with the dots, this represents a couple who are madly in love. They're plastering photos of themselves all over Instagram. The woman's a model. He's so happy. He's showing her off. She's thrilled with him cuz he's got lots of money. They just look absolutely picture perfect.   [50:00]  The intensity is there. They're making love every single night. It's hot. It's passionate. And it's high for about 2 years. and then it drops and then over the next 60 years look at it stays pretty low.   [50:15]  Jonathan height the professor at New York University looked at this people who married or had long-term relationships in a companionate relationship where in the beginning they've said I'm going to partner with someone I can grow with. Maybe it's not so passionate. Maybe I'm not like super in love with this person but I love this person. Look at how that's like compound interest. It just improves over time.   [50:39]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Love Advice - Don't Marry Who You Love"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Dr. Shefali quote, John Gray "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus" (highest selling book dos anos 90), conceito de empatizar vs consertar problemas femininos   [50:41]  Dr. Shafalia actually also says, "Don't marry the person you love. Don't get married because you love your partner."   [50:50]  John Gray, who wrote the highest selling book in the '90s, Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus. This is particularly pertinent, I think, because we're 99% guys in this room. Don't try to fix a woman's problem. Just empathize with her problem.   [51:06]  Telling you, we can all have much more harmonious romantic relationships if we just adhere to this advice.   [51:13]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "HAPPINESS - The Daily 20 Gratitude Practice"   NÚMEROS:  20 coisas para agradecer toda manhã (antes do telefone)   VISUAL:  Conceito de Reticular Activating System (RAS), appreciation vs expectation, mindset positivo vs negativo   [51:15]  Now, happiness is the most important thing. As we head for home here, number one, live a life of appreciation, not expectation.   [51:24]  We have our clients do what's called the daily 20, where every morning when they wake up, before they are allowed to turn on their phone, they must write down 20 things they're grateful for.   [51:36]  And what it does is it activates a bundle of nerves in our brain called the reticular activating system, otherwise known as the RA. And when we write down 20 things that we're grateful for, what tends to happen is that the remainder of the day, we continue to see more evidence that everything's working in our favor. There's more things to be grateful for.   [51:58]  So, we end up living with a positive mindset as opposed to a negative one.   [52:03]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "HAPPINESS - Always Be Learning"   NÚMEROS:  50% pessoas 40+ não aprendem nada novo semanalmente, 60-80 anos participantes, 3-5 classes/semana, 3 meses = cognitive abilities de meia-idade, 12 meses = cognitive abilities de jovens, avó Hazel viveu 103 anos   VISUAL:  Dr. Woo (UC psicologia professor), estudo de 40 pessoas idosas, comparação avó Hazel (crosswords diários, sharp até 103) vs padrasto (80, demência, sem aprendizado)   [52:05]  Second point is always be learning. So, I spoke about this before, personal development programs, hobbies, business seminars.   [52:14]  This is frightening. 50% of people over the age of 40 do not learn any new information on a weekly basis. That is astounding.   [52:25]  This is a professor of psychology at University of California, Dr. Woo, and she studied 40 people aged between 60 and 80. The participants took three to five classes a week for three months. Okay?   [52:39]  And after 3 months they had increased their cognitive abilities to middle-aged levels. And after 12 months they had increased their cognitive abilities to young people levels. So always always always be learning stimulating your mind.   [52:56]  It can slow down the chances or reduce the chances of getting dementia and later age and sharpen the acts of your mind.   [53:04]  My grandmother, she lived to 103 years old. Her name was Hazel. She did a crossword every day for the ent for as long as I knew her. That's an example of learning having her do a cognitively demanding task. And when she died at 103, she was still as sharp as attacked.   [53:23]  My mother's husband is 80. He's got dementia. He's not as sharp as attacked. He is he is going down very, very quickly. He didn't do crosswords. He didn't learn. He just drank booze, hung out with his mates. There was no commitment to ongoing learning.

I knew nothing about art history. On a whim one day, I said, "I'm going to learn something that I know nothing about." So, I went and did a Christiey's art history course in London. I went to New York and did a Sury's art history course.   [53:59]  Now, I can look at this photo and tell you that's a Mark Rothkco painting and that's a Jackson Pollock painting. Not because I'm now cool, but because I was learning.   [54:09]  This will give me no real business advantage, I don't think. But most people in this room are probably only learning stuff about business, right?   [54:18]  I was at dinner the other night and the question was uh what you know discuss a win and a challenge and you can't talk about your business. We went around the table. It was like watching guys just struggling. They didn't know what to talk about other than their business.   [54:33]  So, I'm inviting you guys, as much as we're talking about business here over the next two days, push yourself to learn something new just for the sake of learning something new.

Be intentional with your words. We're all walking around going, I have to, I need to. creates a very dark energy. Whereas if we just change one word, if we change it from I need to to I get to, I have to to I choose to, completely different meaning.   [55:23]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "HAPPINESS - Create Strong Relationships (Harvard Study)"   NÚMEROS:  80 anos de estudo, desde 1938, 2 grupos de homens, 30% aumento risco heart disease/stroke, 50% aumento risco demência, preditor mais forte de suicídio   VISUAL:  Harvard Study longevidade, quality vs quantity de relacionamentos, social isolation = 15 cigarros/dia ou 6 drinks/dia   [55:25]  Last one here, create strong relationships. There's a Harvard study tracked the lives of two groups of men over 80 years since 1938. Participants were regularly interviewed and surveyed about various aspects of their lives, including health, relationships, work, and overall well-being.   [55:45]  The result was is that relationships are the most important predictor of happiness and well-being. Participants who had strong social connections with friends, family, and community were happier, healthier, and lived longer than those who did not.   [56:01]  And the quality of relationships was found to be more important than the quantity. Again, a lot of us here in this room, we're thinking about, I've got friends, I've got acquaintances, I know all these people. Maybe just going deep with some people might give you a greater edge.   [56:18]  Mark Manson, who wrote u subtle art of giving a fuck he actually wrote about this about social isolation. Social isolation is as damaging as smoking 15 cigarettes a day or having six drinks a day.   [56:32]  Loneliness increases the risk of heart disease and stroke by 30%. Chronic loneliness can increase the risk of dementia by 50%. It's also the strongest predictor of su uh suicide.   [56:46]  Have a social group, guys.   [56:49]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Practical Relationship Improvement Strategies"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Lista de táticas: comer com amigos/aliados (survival probability increase), apoiar amigos, Maya Angelou quote sobre fazer pessoas se sentirem bem, Elevator Theory (up or down), curiosidade genuína, compliments, arte de ouvir   [56:51]  Some practical ways to improve relationships. Invite friends and allies to eat with you. I referenced at the beginning of this that my friend's definition of happiness is your subconscious perception of probability of survival. Invite more people for dinner.   [57:06]  When we're eating food, it increases the likelihood of survival. We feel good. When we've got allies, it increases our likelihood of survival. We feel good.   [57:16]  Support your friends and allies. Maya Angelo said, "People will forget what you said and what you did, but will never forget how you made them feel."   [57:26]  Another way is elevator theory. When you meet someone, think of this as an elevator. You're either taking them up or you're taking them down. How can you be of service to that person?   [57:37]  Number three, be genuinely curious about others. Genuinely compliment family, friends, colleagues, and staff. And then the art of just listening, just shutting up and listening. So many people are just wanting to talk and talk and talk. Just shut up and listen.   [57:56]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "HAPPINESS - Embrace Pain and Struggle"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Jonathan Haidt (NYU professor) quote, conceito de não querer ser feliz o tempo todo, "embrace the suck", apreciação através do contraste   [57:58]  Jonathan height, this is the New York professor I was referencing. You want some pain and struggle in your life. He says we want to have a little bit of pain. We want to have a little bit of suffering and struggle. We don't want to be happy all the time. Otherwise, we're going to be unhappy from being happy all the time.   [58:17]  So, another way of saying that is embrace the suck. Sometimes when we're building our business and we're in the weeds, one day we're going to look back and feel so fulfilled about going through the weeds and making it happen.   [58:30]  So the idea is not to live in utopia all the time. We actually want some struggle so we can really appreciate when we're flying.   [58:38]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Life is Empty and Meaningless - Perspective Shift"   NÚMEROS:  40 pessoas na sala = 40 experiências diferentes   VISUAL:  Conceito filosófico de neutralidade de eventos, meaning como construção pessoal, exemplo da própria apresentação sendo interpretada diferentemente por cada pessoa   [58:40]  And then the final thing is life is empty and meaningless, which on initial inspection might feel what what are you talking about?   [58:49]  Here's how to explain it. There is no good. There is no bad. There's just what is right now. There's nothing good or nothing bad happening right now. The only thing that's happening right now is that there's something happening.   [59:03]  And if there's 40 people in this room, 40 people are having a different experience. Some of you are going, "Wow, this talk was amazing." Some of you are going, "Can we get this guy off and get the next person on?" Some people are going, "Wow, I got so much value." Some people are like, "Can we just get back into the Facebook ads growth kind of stuff?"   [59:21]  But the only thing that's happening is that there's a bunch of stuff happening. I'm giving a talk. So when I when I go through life thinking life is empty and meaningless, I just look at everything and go, "This doesn't mean anything except the meaning that I'm associating to it."   [59:37]  And that is so powerful because then the worst possible thing in your mind at least could be happening in your business and then you come back to oh this doesn't mean anything. It's just something that's happening. I lost a million dollars. Okay, I lost a million dollars. It's meaningless. We just start from nothing.   [59:57]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "The Top 5 Regrets of the Dying"   NÚMEROS:  30 anos de pesquisa, 5 arrependimentos principais   VISUAL:  Livro de Bronnie Ware (palliative care nurse, Nova Zelândia), lista de 5 arrependimentos universais de pessoas no fim da vida   [59:59]  I want to leave you with this guys. There's a great book called The Top Five Regrets of the Dying. This is a pallet of care nurse, Bronny Wear. She uh is a nurse in New Zealand and she spent time with folks in the last days of their life.   [60:15]  And she did this for 30 years, listening to their regrets, listening to their regrets for 30 years. And then she wrote a book, and she can summarize it in five things.   [60:26]  Number one, I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me. Some of people in this room, you're still doing, we are still doing stuff that probably upon deep reflection, we shouldn't be doing.   [60:43]  We're probably doing it as an FU to our mom or father or to friends in the school ground who told us we'd amount to nothing. We're trying to prove something. So, I ask you just to ponder, are you living a life true to yourself?   [60:57]  Second thing, I wish I hadn't worked so hard. Now, if you love your work, working feels pretty damn good. But if you guys are working and it doesn't feel that good, might be something for you to just ponder and challenge.   [61:12]  Third thing, I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings. Man, going back to Australia and asking my dad to hug me after 30 years, that was super challenging. But now, when he calls and my mom calls, I pick up the phone. I go, "Oh, my mom's calling. My dad's calling." and I'll go outside and I'll talk to them. It no longer irritates me. I now celebrate it.   [61:36]  Number four, I wish I'd stayed in touch with my friends. I don't know if you guys are anything like me, but in those early days of me being an entrepreneur, I thought if any one of my friends wasn't an entrep entrepreneur or didn't think the right way, they had to go. I'm cutting them.   [61:52]  And a lot of entrepreneurs encourage that. They're like, "Cut your friends. They're no good. They're losers." But when you're on your deathbed, according to nurse Bonnie wear, we're going to wish that we had stayed in touch with them.   [62:05]  Fifth thing, I wish I'd let myself be happier. This is the whole point of this conversation here because when we're happier, then the health, the wealth, and the love starts to flow rather than it being out of sync in that life of that wheel life that we talked about.   [62:23]  It's now working harmoniously. And when that's working harmoniously, the chances of us quote unquote fucking up are so reduced. We don't have to have that Will Smith moment. We don't have to have that Brad Pitt moment where we make all these millions and then it comes crashing down.   [62:40]  Let yourself be happier. And if you can do that, the riches of the world are yours. not just financially but health, wealth, love and happiness. Thank you for listening.     📊 RESUMO EXECUTIVO   NÚMEROS PRINCIPAIS: James: quase 50 anos (49 atualmente) 20+ anos a mais que maioria da sala 15 dias a menos de doença/ano (happier people) Renda
