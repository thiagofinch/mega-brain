[00:00] "appreciate it. So, um, just by show of hands real quick before you guys take everything I say with like, 'Hey, you have to go do this in your business.' Um, do any of you guys serve clients that their clients are um, more mass market people that are probably making like $100,000 or less? Cool. So, two people, that's it. Everyone else sells the super super rich people like all of your Okay, cool."
[00:30] "Cool. Okay. So, uh, I want to be clear in prefacing, um, I have done this strategy that, uh, we'll be going over today with probably 15 different coaches, uh, or 15 different type of personal brands. The people that have done the absolute best are the people that are selling to people that, um, typically they've got $100,000 or less in take-home income because what I've found is that those people typically respect their time the very least, and they want to hold on to their dollars a little bit more."
[01:00] "So, this is an incredible way to nurture people a little bit more before they're ready to make that commitment to buy with you. So, anyway, without uh further ado, let's go ahead and dive in. Unfortunately, Ben is not in the room, but I wanted to take inspiration to say uh ugly slides equals pretty profits. The man, the myth, the legend uh Ben Bader uh added that earlier, but I just thought that was really good and uh worth worth noting once again."

NÚMEROS: $7-$9 ticket price, 3 days, 1 hour per day
VISUAL: Estrutura de evento ao vivo pago com elementos destacando preço baixo, formato de 3 dias, uma hora de ensino diário, apresentador único
[01:45] "So, real quick, what is a paid live event? Uh there's a couple different things that make mine a little bit different than your traditional webinar or even typical free challenge. I always recommend charging on the front end. Nothing crazy. We're talking like $7 to $9 almost like nominal. Like why the heck would you do that? We'll get into that in a second."
[02:00] "But uh usually the events that we've done that have done the most profit are structured over three days where you're going to teach only like one hour a day. It's not crazy. It's not not like you're doing um it's not like you've got to block off your entire day for hey, we're going to teach content for four hours. You don't need a whole bunch of special speakers."
[02:20] "You as the presenter or you as the um if you have a client, great. If if they're the personal brand, it's one specific presenter is teaching for about one hour per day for three days in a row, same time. Um and it does not matter what time you do. I've tested out 7:00 p.m. 12:00 p.m. Doesn't really matter. It's more so whenever you you know that your clients are going to be uh or the prospects will be most available."
[02:45] "So, usually structured over three days priced around $7 to $9. Sell as many of those tickets as possible. During the event, you're going to give people the offer to upgrade or ascend into the flagship program. Nothing too crazy there. And then um obviously use as a way to create a surge of cash. And then ideally, if you really want, you take the recordings of all of this and turn it into an evergreen program that you could continue getting more and more customers moving forward."
[03:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Who Are These Perfect For?"
NÚMEROS: $100,000 household income or less, $1,000-$3,000 price range, $10,000 offers mentioned
VISUAL: Perfil de cliente ideal: coaches, personal brands, clientes com mais tempo que dinheiro, ofertas escaláveis em fulfillment
[03:20] "So, uh let's go ahead. Got to add them. Cool. Um, yeah, as mentioned, who these are perfect for, uh, I've found coaches, personal brands, um, really, as long as their ideal clients or customers have more time available than they have money. So, usually I found it's that $100,000, uh, household income or less, those people are great to attend these sorts of events."
[03:45] "Um, this is also perfect for when you have a flagship offer that's scalable in fulfillment. If you're doing a done for you program and you kind of have limited quantities of clients you can take on, I wouldn't re wouldn't really recommend the amount of work that's going to go into this if you can only take on a certain amount of clients."
[04:00] "Um, and then also what I have I I put this in asterisk. I said main offer ranging from that $1,000 to $3,000 price point. Uh, I have seen this work well for call funnels. I've also seen it work well for promoting direct to a checkout $10,000 offers. However, highest conversion rates that I have seen personally are from that $1 to $3,000 price range going straight to a checkout."
[04:25] "It's most scalable. It doesn't matter if you have a hundred people at that live event where the most I've ever seen is 15,000 people bought tickets to a live event. So, obviously, it's like, yeah, there's only so many people that are going to be able to uh take sales calls from a situation like that. So, ideally, sending them to a checkout's great."

VISUAL: Foto de Jai Long, Wedding Photography Summit, gráfico mostrando escalada de vendas, conversão de 8,000 pessoas em $250K
[04:50] "Now, uh for inspiration, here's how I came across this strategy was back in 2020. uh 2020. It's 2020 is whenever I came across his strategy. Jai Long here in the the top left, he had hired me uh to consult him on how to essentially scale up ticket sales. He was going to be running a uh an event called the wedding photography summit. He coaches wedding photographers how to scale up their business and try to actually hit their first $100,000 year in revenue as a wedding photographer."
[05:20] "So, he reached out to me. He said, 'Hey man, um I know you do a lot of Facebook ads. Can you help us scale up ticket sales? number one, we want more sales to the event, and they were selling them for $7. And then he also wanted um to figure out how does he get his uh upsells, like his order bumps and one-click upsells and stuff to convert at a higher rate to increase his average order value."
[05:45] "So, we worked on that and uh it was an 8week engagement and we scaled it up to the point where he had 8,000 people that were signed up for this event. Uh it was a couple days before he went live. I was like, 'Hey man, it was a great engagement. It was uh just a pleasure working with you.' I said, 'Hey, I'm just curious. what are you pitching during this event? He said, I hadn't thought about that. I wasn't planning on pitching anything. I just wanted to host an an awesome lowcost event."
[06:15] "Like, you're an idiot. You got 8,000 people. You must hate money. I'm like, you have 8,000 people that are customers that are sitting in front of you for the next two days. You got to give him some sort of an offer. And he had a $2,000 coaching program that was totally scalable in fulfillment, and he just hadn't even thought about offering it to him."
[06:35] "I like, J, I'd highly suggest you don't even have to do a crazy pitch. Just give them an offer. And uh that one suggestion made him an extra quarter million dollars in the next 48 hours. So um anyway, yeah, he had 125 people buy a 2K program. I'm like, yeah, that's probably a good move."

[07:05] "Um anyway, so then the reason why uh she is next on this slide, her name is Kristen Boss. Uh pretty sweet last name. And uh she had she was already working with me and she had just started her coaching business in 2020. It was her first full year in business. She was pacing around $500,000 a year in in income that year uh in in revenue, I'm sorry, not income."
[07:30] "And uh she was trying to work with me to figure out how can she scale up uh some events as well. And she reached out to me like literally 2 days after Jai hosted his event. And she's like, 'Hey, I'm thinking about like instead of doing a webinar, I'm thinking about doing a live event. I'm going to go live 3 days and just get as many people there as free as possible.' I was like, 'Yeah, I like it.' I was like, 'But one of my other client just charged $7 and he had a great show up rate from that.' I was like, 'I I'd highly suggest you at least charge for that.' She's like, 'Cool. Let's do it.'"
[08:00] "And so here's what that looked like in real time. So you can see this was October of 2020. She made $16,000 in her business. Really not a whole lot of money. Next month she did 30K. That's cute. And then December we hosted this event for the first time, $248,000. She had an email list of about I don't know, call it few hundred people and she had a Facebook group of about 3,000 people. So, this is her this was like the start of growing her business.

It is a loss leader on the front end usually. Um and then we hosted a different themed event in May. And May of that next year, she made almost a million dollars. So, uh, not bad given the fact that the last year before, uh, her average month she was doing like, uh, I'd say on average she was doing like $40,000."

[10:00] "Now, um, instead of just saying like, hey, we can make a whole bunch of money. I want to give you guys specific stats so you guys can actually understand some potential KPIs you might be able to expect from an event like this. Uh, we just did an event uh, I don't know, it just wrapped up a couple weeks ago in December for her. And this was the data."
[10:20] "So, we spent 80 I don't think it's actually on here as far as our ad spend. We spent $80,000 in ad spend here. In total, we had 5,760 people sign up. That's between both ads as well as emails, uh, like uh, remarketing to her existing warm audience."
[10:40] "Now, from the 5,700 people, we actually had a little profit maximizer here and we got 8,500 registrants. How do we do that? Instead of saying, 'Hey, just buy one ticket,' we also had a three-pack and a 10 pack available saying, 'Hey, if you'd like to buy some tickets for your friends, make sure they're leveling up with you as well, go ahead and do that.'"
[11:00] "And so you can see that here's the data on this. You had about 5,000 people buy single tickets. You had 560 people buy the three-pack and 226 people bought 10 packs. So that increased the capacity for the event to 8,900 people."
[11:20] "Now the way that works is that whenever someone would say, 'Hey, I want a 10 pack.' They'd be taken to a thank you page that were like, 'Hey, who are your nine friends that you'd like to add? We'll add them to our email list right now. Send them invites.' So of that, we found that 96% of the total potential people actually made it onto the email list."
[11:45] "So meaning uh of all those people that bought like a 10 pack, they actually had like their nine friends ready to go of like, 'Hey, here's here's all their emails. Add them right now.' So it worked out pretty well. Front-end revenue, once again, we spent 80k. We made 105,000 in front-end revenue. So she went into this event not technically even needing to make another dollar because she was actually already profitable."
[12:10] "Um not profitable from cost of acquisition on ads. They actually they were trash this year. Um just call that what it is. Um anyway, it's $225 to get a new customer to buy a ticket. was $151 when we were market when we were remarketing to people to buy a ticket. They were $9 tickets. Um, so not great performance on the ads front. I'll call that what it is."

[12:40] "Um, anyway, then we go down her backend enrollment. Uh, she was charging $2,000 for her offer. Uh, she also had a payment plan as well. She had 572 people buy. Uh, that is a conversion rate that is not correct. It was, uh, actually about 6 something% uh, for the conversion rate from total uh, total registrance to actually buying the back-end program."
[13:05] "Um, we had, by the way, a 40% show up rate on this, which is, if anyone does live events, you don't see 40% show up rates. Uh, I'll get into that in a second. Well, I've got all the optimizations that I recommend for all of our clients here after this. I just want to show you guys the data."
[13:25] "Um, anyway, so we had 572 people buy backend cash collected within like a 4-day window, $938,000. So, you add that with the upfront revenue, we had a million, just over a million dollars in upfront cash collected. And that does not include recurring payments that will made that will be made from the payment plan uh users as well. So not bad overall of 12.4 uh 12.4 rorowaz. So not bad."

NÚMEROS: Não especificado
VISUAL: Lista de benefícios: atraem compradores, maior show rate, baixa pressão, evergreen potential
[14:00] "Anyway, now that we've gone over data, you guys understand this works. Um why do these work? Number one, they work because they attract buyers, which in my opinion, in most of my clients opinion, and I would imagine most of you guys' opinions, it's always easier to get someone that's already trusted you with their 16-digit credit card number to give them another offer."
[14:25] "like they're always going to convert more than someone that's like, 'Ah, I've given this person my email. Are they really worth giving a dollar to? If they've already given you a couple dollars, they're going to be more likely to trust you to give you more dollars in the future.'"
[14:40] "Um, also, we have higher show up rates since they already have some skin in the game. Not much. Obviously, if any single person in this room right now paid me $9 and I was like, 'Hey, come to the come to my virtual event.' I promise you not not too many people are going to be concerned about recouping their $9 investment in here because you guys are all making most of you guys are all making significantly more than bottom line six figures."
[15:05] "So anyway, just once again keep keep in mind this is great for mass market. And then um also low pressure. I'm going to teach you guys in a second, but the way that we have all of our clients do this, it leaves people actually wanting to buy from you as compared to you having to like do a bait and switch and then hardcore sell them at the end of the event."
[15:25] "Um, and then lastly, we do turn them into evergreen, uh, as it has been proven to convert into keep building your list. So, here's a typical timeline of kind of what this looks like."
[15:35] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Typical Timeline"
NÚMEROS: 3 weeks promotion, 1 week pre-event, 3 days live teaching, Day 4 bonus Q&A, Days 5-7 fast action bonus
VISUAL: Timeline visual mostrando fluxo completo do evento: promoção → preparação → execução → follow-up, com marcos temporais claros
[15:40] "We will promote event tickets for 3 weeks. So, if you're going to do an event, let's call it's like the 21st of May. Cool. We start event promo, opening up ticket sales on May 1st. So, we do event promo for three weeks, one week prior to the event starting."
[16:00] "We do not do these in ever webinar. I'm sure we could. I just haven't tried it out with any client. I like to repeat successful actions as well. And uh so what we found that works really really well is just hosting these in a Facebook group. You'll pop up a Facebook group a week before the event starts. You send out emails to everyone that's already bought tickets."
[16:25] "You say, 'Hey, the event's ready to go. Come on in, join the room. We're going to have some fun the week prior. Get everyone excited.' And then during the actual event, uh the client will go they'll go live on Zoom and just stream into that Facebook uh group. That way they are not distracted with seeing a bunch of comments, but they can deliver a great presentation easily record it."
[16:50] "So that way they're planning to make it evergreen after, but it looks like they're I mean they literally are live in that Facebook group. But that way you also get the community effect in all the comments. I'll explain the reason why you want to do that after."
[17:05] "So you do the event day 1, two, and three. You teach content. You actually teach content. You do not you do not just give fluff the entire time. You teach all of the what, but don't go s don't go too too deep into the how."
[17:25] "So, for example, if Jeremy was going to do this to a bunch of uh low-level agency owners and he was trying to teach them how to get their first five clients and let's say he wanted to do an event on uh here's how to do or I would say here's how to go get your first five clients using this one simple method."
[17:45] "And the first day he could talk about uh the power of video pitches and then the second day he could talk about uh different clients he's gotten from video pitches or maybe some some ways that video pitches have really really worked well. And then maybe the third day it's like I don't know something else."
[18:05] "But he's teaching like more of the what about the video pitch. He's not saying, 'Hey, say this exact same thing in every single video pitch or here's how to fulfill on the service.' He's just teaching one highle thing."
[18:20] "And then after that, you actually do a bonus day four. So it's it's now it's a surprise and delight factor. Day 1, two, and three, you're actually teaching content. Throughout the whole three days, you are sprinkling in as you're teaching legit content, you're saying, 'Hey, by the way, yeah, we go way more in depth into my DMM.'"
[18:45] "if this is Jeremy or uh if you guys have whatever other program it's like, 'Hey, yeah, we we we go way more into this inside of this program.' Or, 'Hey, by the way, what you're seeing right here, Sally leveraged this same strategy in our in our coaching pro program to achieve XYZ result.' So, you're continuing to sprinkle in belief in why your program is awesome."
[19:10] "And then day four, well, as at technical day three, you're like, 'Hey, by the way, who's loved this event so far?' And everyone's excited. You're like, 'Hey, by the way guys, tomorrow we're actually going to do a bonus Q&A day to talk about what could this look like if you really want to continue working with us moving forward. You guys have heard a lot about our program. We want to tell you all about it."
[19:35] "Um, and if you don't want to care, like if you don't want to hear about it, no big deal. We won't go through it, but if you want to come on tomorrow, we're going to have a lot of fun. We'll still get a lot of value out of that. So, that bonus uh the bonus Q&A day, that's where truly the main pitch happens."
[19:55] "And then you day five, six, and seven, you have a fast action bonus.' Uh now I know Ben mentioned that uh he does not do legit bonuses. Um we recommend doing legit bonuses uh more so for FTC compliance."
[20:10] "Uh we normally like I've I've seen different things where uh Kristen for example, she'll do a double book bonus. She's got a bunch of ebooks that she'll give you that she's made like uh different followalong journals you could download and you could use that in uh in your business. And instead of doing those like whenever you join her main program, instead of just getting the ebooks of those, she'll actually send you out physical printed versions of all of those things."
[20:35] "but the people love it. You could also do swag, you could do some fun hoodies, um you could do cups, whatever, like whatever your audience would actually like. Uh you could also do just simply a small um small discount."
[20:50] "So, let's say that you're selling a program for $5,000, you say, 'Hey, for anyone that buys over the next 48 hours, it is literally priced at $3,000 over the next 48 hours and that's it.' And make sure that you actually adjust your price point after that's all over. So, that's kind of the timeline."

NÚMEROS: 5-10% conversion rate (cold traffic), 30% conversion rate (warm traffic)
VISUAL: Lista de táticas de otimização: Facebook ads, email marketing, preços baixos ($7-$9), pedidos de referral, multi-ticket packs
[21:15] "Now, let's talk about some more specific uh optimizers here. Increasing registrations. Um, number one, we always do uh Facebook ads. You always do uh hit your email list super super hard. Not enough people hit their email list on this. So, um anyway, you do that."
[21:35] "Also, make sure that you charge small prices. I've tried seeing people or I've seen people try to do $27, $47, $97, even $297 for their event ticket. You are not trying to make profit on this event ticket. It does not matter. It is just to get buy in from the initial person that's buying it. So that way they're more likely to attend."
[21:55] "Don't increase so much friction on the front end when the actual profit is made in the back end. So anyway, keep your ticket prices low. It'll keep your higher or it'll keep your conversion rates way higher during these uh during the actual sales page."
[22:10] "Normally, by the way, uh cold traffic, I am looking for somewhere between a 5 to a 10% conversion rate on that sales page from cold traffic. Uh Kristen on her most uh recent December launch that I just mentioned, we launched it for three days to her email list before we launched ads. We were just curious what it was going to convert at for warm traffic."
[22:35] "It converted at 30%. Every single person that went to the sales page alone went through, 30% of them were actually buying event tickets. Um, so and then it went obviously way down to it was about 5 to 6% for cold traffic specifically that was buying it. So anyway, there's that."
[22:55] "Um, also ask for referrals on that confirmation pitch. So always recommend having a video right after someone purchases their ticket saying, 'Hey, congratulations. I'm really, really excited you just bought your ticket. This event's going to be massively valuable.'"
[23:15] "once again, we're going to teach you this, this, and this. Um, and really like getting them more hyped up and re uh just more so encouraging them on why they just made that purchase. And then saying, 'Look, if you want to grow fast, cool. Go alone. If you want to grow far, go together. Make sure that you attend this event with someone, whether it's a good friend of yours, someone that you trust, someone that's in the same industry, whatever you're selling."
[23:40] "Obviously, you have to uh change the wording to whatever you feel is best for your audience, but essentially saying, 'Hey, look, if you really really want to get a lot out of this, have someone to be uh holding you accountable and go invite them to this event as well. Make sure they get a ticket.' And so now you're actually leveraging power of uh more so like word of mouth and referral to get more registrations."
[24:05] "Also, as mentioned earlier, you could sell multi- ticket packs. that I've only done that for one event, so I have no idea if that's going to work for you, but we did effectively increase the event attendance by it was like 54 56% whenever we did that. So, I don't know, take that for what it's worth."
[24:25] "Um, also using irresistible order bumps. So, if you're going to sell an offer for like, hey, this is $7 or this is $9 to attend this event, someone might not care that much about the event. But if they're on the page and they're checking everything out, they might see on the order bump that you have, maybe it's a $17 order bump and it's a really awesome, seemingly very, very valuable PDF that they could get immediate access to before the event even happens."
[24:55] "That order bump might then uh in and of itself actually make sure like make them want to buy it because they don't they've not seen that order bump elsewhere. So, it's like, well, if I want to get the order bump, I actually have to buy the ticket first. So, um I would say work on your order bumps and then uh email us email your list super super hard."
[25:15] "And then also lastly on increasing registrations, try to host these events consistently. Um the more that you host these events, uh the more they compound. What I've found is that they're not incredibly great for getting completely cold traffic to say, 'Hey, take my credit card right here, right now.' You will absolutely have a small percentage of people that will do that."
[25:40] "But what we have found is that they will they're and um they're very very very good at clearing out your list. So if you've got a bucket of call it a couple hundred people on your email list or maybe a couple thousand people on your email list or a couple hundred thousand people on your email list, whatever."
[26:00] "If you have people that have maybe been toying around with the idea of purchasing with you or the idea of working with you at a greater level, these are incredible events for getting them to go over the edge and say, 'You know what? I'm going to go ahead and uh uh invest into the this program because this person delivered so much value over the last 3 days."
[26:25] "So anyway, um obviously they might watch an event. What the reason why you want to do these consistently is because they might watch your first event and maybe they came in from cold traffic. They're like, 'Yeah, this is really good. Not so sure I want to buy right now.' And they continue following you on social media or whatever for the next four months, ne maybe next three months. You do another event and they're like, 'Hey, the last one was really, really good. We want to go to this next one.' And then that next one, it's very, very likely that they will convert. Uh, so anyway, there's that."
[26:55] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Increasing Show Rates"
NÚMEROS: 40% show rate (best), 30% show rate (worst), $5,000-$10,000 budget for gifts
VISUAL: Táticas para aumentar presença: email/SMS notifications, giveaways pré-evento, sorteios durante live, skin in the game
[27:00] "Now, increasing those show rates, like I said, we had uh 40% show rate on the most recent event. Uh, worst I think I've ever seen with any client was 30% show rate. So, the way that we've done this number one is through, well, this probably kind of out of order, email and SMS notifications. That's by default. You've got to be doing that stuff."
[27:20] "Um, and actually Ben, if you guys are looking for great email and SMS notifications, Ben had a great little stack that he had mentioned earlier today in his presentation. So, I'll defer to him on the more tactics of that."
[27:35] "But then also pre-event fun with giveaways or bonus trainings, workbooks, etc. What I mean by that is uh whenever you open up the Facebook group, uh you can actually do something where it's like, hey, uh we opened up the Facebook group. Yes, we don't technically go live for another week from now. However, the first 500 people that actually join the Facebook group uh or anyone that joins the Facebook group today will be entered in to win a raffle for XYZ will announce the winner tomorrow in the Facebook group."
[28:05] "and like legit things like give away Nespresso uh like Nespresso machines or you could give away uh those like Ember mugs or whatever else you want to do. Once again, you've got to make it relevant to your audience, but give away like legitimate value gifts. Um I think my client Christian, she usually uh budgets somewhere between5 and $10,000 in gifts to actually make sure that like these people are actually really excited about their gifts. So anyway, do that"
[28:35] "and then um you can also do uh giveaways for the people who show up live. So this is before this is like the week before. And then the giveaway is for people who show up live. It's the same thing. It's saying, 'Hey, tomorrow we go live. By the way, before we start the training, we're going to do a giveaway. Anyone that is the I would say like the first five minutes of anyone that's there live, we're going to do a giveaway for anyone that's there live."
[29:00] "And we we might also do another fun giveaway at the end of the training. So that way people are incentivized to be there immediately when you start. So that increases those show up rates. Also you people paid to be there. So that will help a uh that will help as well."
[29:20] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Increasing Backend Conversion Rate"
NÚMEROS: $2,000 offer mentioned, 3 hours over 3 days timeframe
VISUAL: Estratégias de conversão: preframe transparente, bonus Q&A day, fast action bonus legítimo, revogar acesso aos replays
[29:25] "And then uh optimizers continued now for increasing the back-end conversion rate. Number one, I'd say this is probably the most unique thing about this entire pitch is that there's not a crazy hard pitch. I actually recommend every single person opens up their event by saying this is a this is a huge preframe and please use it."
[29:50] "You guys could do it on a webinar, you could do it on a sales call, you could do it on a YouTube video, whatever else you got to do it on. Uh they was re they was uh go live and they say, 'Hey guys, I'm so so excited that you're here with me today. Uh once again, as promised, we're going to go over this and this and this over the next 3 days. It's going to be awesome."
[30:15] "But let's call a spade to spade. Let's address the elephant in the room. I cannot change your life in 3 hours, within the next 3 days. It just cannot be done. If you guys are looking to achieve XYZ result in your life, you need more consistency. You need to be surrounded with way more community. You need to be surrounded with way more knowledge. And I can only teach you so much over the next 3 days."
[30:40] "While it's going to be powerful, once again, I just want to be very clear. I can't do that much in 3 days. This would be good. However, stick around at the end of the three days. If you guys like this at all, you're going to love what I have for you at the end of this. Uh I do have a program that you guys I really do think are going to uh be a great fit for or you might feel that like you're a great fit for it."
[31:05] "And uh maybe you're aware of that program, maybe you're not. Uh stick around regardless. I've got a great offer for you that you've never seen before. So anyway, you're actually telling them like there's an offer at the end of this. You could also be upfront with your pricing on that as well. You could say, 'By the way, it's a $2,000 offer at the end of this event. Um, I'll tell you guys more about it later on, but just want to let you guys know that's that's what there is to sell here."
[31:35] "It immediately drops everyone's guards because so many people I would say most people know that they're going to be pitched in a webinar or they're going to be pitched in a live event. So, just be transparent about it. That way, they're not sitting there wondering, 'Ah, what's this person going to pitch me? Uh, can I even trust what they're saying? Are they just trying to like sell to me?'"
[32:00] "Like, you're just saying, 'Look, guys, there will be an offer at the end of this. If you want it, awesome. If not, no big deal. This is going to be a great time.' And so, their guards drop. They're like, 'Oh, yeah. This person's trustworthy. They're a little bit more transparent. I I like that. And now they're actually watching the event with the idea of if like they're not trying to go get another guide to teach them the same thing that you're teaching them."
[32:25] "If you teach them how to get fit, they don't want to watch this for the next 3 days and say, 'Okay, great. This is going to be good. Now I'm going to go find another person to teach me more about getting fit.' They're like, 'No, I'm here because I want to get fit. You're the person that I trust, and hopefully I can keep working with you.'"
[32:45] "So now they're going to say uh internally, this is more of an internal dialogue, but they're going to say, 'Okay, how can I get the value that I need to get out of this over the next 3 days to justify continuing to work with this person?' So anyway, a huge preframe on opening up like that."
[33:05] "Then also once again, the bonus Q&A day that helps both with uh surprise and delight, but also your just objection handling. and you're like, 'Hey, by the way, I know a lot of you guys have asked me over the last 3 days, um, is this program good for someone that is a busy working mom or is this person good for someone that's in this sort of a career right now?' Like, yes, and here's why. So, you're really just going through a bunch of objection handling on that bonus Q&A day."
[33:35] "Um, let's see. Then you once again offer a fast action bonus with a legitimate deadline. Take that for what it's worth. uh FTC uh would agree, but then also like your people will tr uh trust you and and appreciate you for being genuinely transparent about that sort of stuff."
[33:55] "Um and then also revoke access to the event recordings at the deadline. So, hypothetically speaking, you start your event on a Monday and you go live Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, bonus Q&A day on a Thursday. Then you have the fast action bonus lasting until Sunday night. Not only does the bonus end on Sunday night, but you'd also say, 'By the way, this Facebook group closes and all replays to this event completely go away for good.'"
[34:25] "So, if you'd like to continue learning about this, you have to buy. So, there's that. And then, um, also have people share proof when they join so you can officially recognize them. So, for example, uh, as you're kind of going through that pitch, you're like, 'By the way, like we just want to we just want to appreciate and and show um show our appreciation for anyone that takes action around here. We love action takers."
[34:50] "Uh, by the way, you guys just heard about this. go ahead and comment in the chat or go ahead and post in the Facebook group uh maybe a screenshot of the thank you page if you guys just went ahead and bought that. We want to know we want to celebrate you in here. And so once that first person makes that initial that initial comment of like, 'Yep, just bought.' Or like just got in. Then just expect them to keep on coming."
[35:15] "It's like the social proof is so great and then it's just a celebration of like everyone's in the group saying like, 'Oh yeah, I got in and I got in.' They're actually like congratulating each other and then it becomes like a FOMO thing for anyone that hasn't bought. they're like, 'Dang, all these other people have bought and like I kind of want to be like them as well.' And it encourages each other to level up. So anyway, that also helps increase those back-end conversion rates."
[35:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Leveraging Affiliates - Game Changer"
NÚMEROS:
578 total backend conversions
222 from affiliates
$374,000 from affiliates
$100 affiliate commission
$100 buyer discount
Net revenue: $1,800 vs $2,000
VISUAL: Breakdown de afiliados: existing program members como afiliados, estrutura de comissão/desconto, impacto massivo de $374K adicional
[35:50] "And lastly, uh we just started testing this out uh this year and this has worked very very well. Leveraging affiliates. What I mean by that before I go on to this next slide, the affiliates that I'm talking about are not talk I'm not saying like, 'Hey, go leverage some other huge personal brand and have them send a bunch of people your way.' You can absolutely do that. I just haven't tried it."
[36:15] "Uh what we've tried that is working very very well is taking the people that are already in the main program that you're going to be pitching in this uh live event and having them have affiliate links saying, 'Hey, go promote this live event.' You guys know how great these things are. And you also know that that's when most people will actually want to join the main group that you're already in."
[36:40] "And if you'd like your commission to get people uh in the main program, get as many people in this program as possible, share links to that. And then also we'll make sure that you have your own individual links to promote the main program. And the main program, the affiliates get like a $100 discount on a $2,000 pro uh product."
[37:00] "So the person that's buying from an affiliate, if they're watching, they're like, 'Man, this is great.' And Christian's pitching it for 2K instead, they their affiliate can reach out to them and be like, 'Hey, if you were interested in that, I can help you get it for $1,900.' So there's a $100 affiliate commission. There's also a $100 discount for anyone the affiliate is return is is sending in."
[37:25] "So, it's essentially $1,800 now of net revenue compared to the 2k in net revenue. So, here's what in December, um, 578 of those backend conversions, those 2K conversions that I'd mentioned, 222 of them came from affiliates. That was an extra $374,000 from affiliates saying, 'Hey, my my my all my friends need to be at this event.'"
[37:55] "And then reaching out to all their friends and they're like, 'Hey, by the way, Kristen's going to give you this incredible offer. I'm already in the group. I want you to come on in with me and if you want to do it, I can get you a discount. Let me know. You know, she made an extra $374,000 from the her affiliates this past uh event. That was a huge profit maximizer."
[38:20] "Um so yeah, I think that was about it. Then follow the audience. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry to told you all that. Um, that's it."
