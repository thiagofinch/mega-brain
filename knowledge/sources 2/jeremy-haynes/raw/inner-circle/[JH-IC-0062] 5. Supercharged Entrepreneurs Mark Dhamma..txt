[06:47] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Here's how I discovered the five shifts."
NÚMEROS: 5 shifts, 2008
VISUAL: Transição para história pessoal
[06:50] So here's how I discovered the five shifts. Um, so quick story, I've been working with entrepreneurs since 2008 and my background is sport science and physiology. So I was working with athletes, helping athletes perform at the best.
[07:04] Long story short, I got um became a personal trainer. And so as it happened, I just started working with a lot of entrepreneurs. I just had a lot of entrepreneurs as clients.
[07:14] I started looking at the entrepreneur as a type of athlete because like okay, I can train you, but what type of athlete are you? Well, you're a business athlete. Okay, your game is business. You want to win the game of business.
[07:27] So I start to think, well, how do you win the game of business? Well, you're going to make great decisions. If you make a lot of quality decisions, then your business is going to grow. If you make a lot of bad decisions, then more than likely you're going to go bankrupt, which is more than 80% of businesses.
[07:44] I don't know the stats, but it's way the majority of businesses go bankrupt. So, as a entrepreneur, how can we increase your performance? How can we increase your decision making ability?
[07:55] There's lots of different ways. One of them is diet. One of them's your being able to increase your focus. One of them's being able to increase your brain power. Another one's being able to increase your productivity through habit.
[08:07] But one of the biggest things, in fact, I would argue is the biggest thing is optimizing your sleep, your sleep quality.
[08:14] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "SHIFT #1: Sleep is the lead domino of your performance"
NÚMEROS: 80%+
VISUAL: Primeiro dos cinco shifts, conceito de "lead domino"
[08:16] So, there are five shifts you must maybe you must make to be able to go from tossing and turning all night to sleeping like a baby and waking up full of energy to invest and grow your business to the best of your ability. So I'm going to walk through all five of them now.
[08:32] So the first shift is seeing that sleep is the lead domino of your performance. The lead domino. Meaning that if you have any lack of sleep that compromises your decision making, your willpower, your energy for the whole day.
[08:48] You are a decision-making athlete. So, if you've got a little bit less sleep, your ability to make good decisions drops immensely. Think about it for a second. Your ability to make good decisions are down to your knowledge and skills.
[09:02] That's why you're here this weekend, to learn knowledge and skills. That's why you're part of the mastermind, to learn business knowledge and skills. But it's also down to your physical and mental well-being.
[09:14] If you're tired or like Jeremy was saying at the beginning, he was stressed, you're not going to see the big opportunities that are around you for your business. You're not going to be able to.
[09:24] In fact, research has shown that if you're tired or stressed, your brain doesn't allocate that much resources to the front of your brain, which your prefrontal cortex, that's your human mind, your ability to actually see opportunities to be able to make great decisions.
[09:40] Your brain doesn't do it. It keeps the energy in the back of your brain, which is your, you can call it your reptile brain, the fear-based mind. So, you literally don't have access to your mo most brain power if you're tired or if you're stressed. You can't do it. You can't make great decisions.

[15:52] That's where you should start having thoughts around work. That's where all your brain you should go on about work. It's time to focus and get work done.
[16:00] When you're in the rest of your house, you want your brain to know, oh, I can relax. Oh, it's this is time to spend time with my family, my wife, my kids, or just to hang out and chill, my fiance, whatever. Time to relax.

[24:27] I saw something interesting um for his last fight. Actually, it wasn't his last fight. It was a couple of years ago. And Jon Jones, I believe Jon Jones is a goat. I think he's a goat. Like, no one's beaten that guy ever. I don't think I think he's a goat.
[24:42] And when he goes to a fight, a couple of days when he's there in the hotel room, wherever he's fighting, he sets up his hotel room for success. So, the first thing that he does after he's put his bags down, is he goes around the hotel room and starts sticking up motivational quotes, posters, letters from fans.
[25:02] Um, he loves Muhammad Ali. So, put Muhammad Ali photos up there. Everything influential. His walls of the whole hotel room are covered in motivational quotes. And his goals, I am the greatest. I've I am I've never been beaten.
[25:18] He sees himself as he believes that he's going to be the only undefeated athlete um in the UFC. I think Kabib didn't get beat either, but he sees himself as like totally undefeable.
[25:30] and he has it all over the hotel room because he knows that's where he's going to be spending his time. And I encourage you to do that type of stuff with your office. You want your office or when you walk in there, you feel like Superman. You know what's going on. You're just so positive. You're on a different energetic level.
[25:48] That's the point. You want to be on a different energetic level when you walk into the office. Do you guys get what I mean with that? Who has that right now? Who walks into the office and like Omar? Yeah, kind of. Yeah, Sean.
[26:02] Well, Sean, that doesn't surprise me because Sean is very deep into um hypnosis. He's a hypnotist. He into a lot of self hypnosis, so he knows the importance of that. You want to hypnotize yourself by filling it with positive messages.

[27:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "RELAX (Float Tanks)"
NÚMEROS: 10+ times, 3 sessions minimum
VISUAL: Introdução aos float tanks como ferramenta de relaxamento
[27:02] Relax and recover. Has anyone used float tanks much? What's your experience with them?
[27:08] >> Oh, not much.
[27:09] >> Not much.
[27:10] >> Well, I've used it a couple times.
[27:12] >> Okay. Who's used it over like say 10 times? Nobody.
[27:16] So float tanks are like meditation on steroids, but it takes the research says it takes at least three sessions to be able to actually relax in them. So when they're doing studies in float tanks, which they do a lot of, they have the part participants come in for at least three times in them before they start the study because they know it takes at least three times to adapt.
[27:38] But with a float tank, who doesn't know what one is? Never tried it. Who's never tried it? All right, so most of you have never tried it.
[27:46] So basically what a float tank does, it takes all stimulation away from you. So it takes all stimulation away from your senses. So it's completely d dark when you get in there. It should be silent. The waters to body temperature. So it doesn't feel hot or cold. It's perfect.
[28:04] And is full of magnesium salt. Magnesium is a fantastic mineral anyway. Apparently most of the um US population is deficient in magnesium and magnesium is what helps you sleep, what actually makes your nervous system feel relaxed.
[28:20] So if people are on edge a lot all the time, a lot of the time it's magnesium. If you give them magnesium, they tend to calm down and relax.
[28:28] Anyway, in the float tank, that is one of the best places you could ever possibly relax. And in there, it is a great place to sleep, is a great place to visualize, and it is actually also a great place to relax and think of business problems.
[28:44] You know, there's like the old cliche that you get your best business ideas when you're in the shower. You're kind of not thinking about them. you're just doing about other stuff. That's because we have different we've got like two types of minds to put it very very simply. Okay?
[29:00] We have our active mind, our conscious mind which we're all working on here. Then we have our unconscious mind which is aware of everything in the background. And when we're really relaxed and chill like in a float tank in the shower, sometimes that allows ideas from our unconscious mind just to pop up into our conscious. Usually great ideas.
[29:20] So that's what can happen in a float tank. So, I highly recommend them. And of course, make sure you have a beautiful woman in a bed with you, too.

NÚMEROS: 4
VISUAL: Quarto shift focado em cafeína e respiração
[31:20] your four. Stop the caffeine and breathe. So, I don't think you're going to be able to hear this, so I'm going to play it um and talk you through it.
[31:30] So, does anyone has anyone like looked into what coffee does to your brain? Few of you guys have. Yeah. Cool.
[31:38] So, I've been looking into what coffee does in the brain because a couple of years ago, I took a whole year off caffeine just to see what it was like. Um I was drinking Yeah. I was it was a bad it it felt like a bad idea at the time.
[31:54] It was actually for my 36th year. I was like, you know what? I like to do a challenge for my for the year of my birthday. Every new year I like to do a challenge. And it's usually a challenge that I know is going to suck, but it's probably good for me.
[32:10] And that year, the challenge, which I knew was going to suck, was probably good for me was not having caffeine for a year. So, I did it. And for the first it sucked. It was awful actually.
[32:22] every day for the first I would say 90 days I was kicking myself. Why did I do this? This is such a bad idea. What an idiot. Why don't you say have a week of coffee or two weeks of coffee, not a whole year off coffee. It was awful. All I could think about was drinking coffee for 90 days.
[32:40] But then after 90 days, I couldn't care less about coffee. And all of a sudden, I had energy all the time. I wasn't tired in the morning. I actually had way more energy. I felt way more mental clarity. I was like much more like present with my kids and my family and life just seemed way easier and I had more energy. I just felt better without having coffee.
[33:04] So I started digging into like what does it actually do to your brain? And this is a real quick it's not going to play guys. I'm sorry about that. All right. While tech person's fixing it, I'll tell you briefly and very simply what it does.
[33:18] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "How Caffeine Works in Your Brain"
NÚMEROS: N/A
VISUAL: Diagrama explicativo sobre adenosina e receptores
[33:20] So we have these things in our brain called adenazine receptors. Okay? And denazine apparently is um a chemical called released by our body to let us be tired, to let us know, hey, now it's time to be tired. And what caffeine does is it gets in those adenazine receptors first and blocks them.
[33:40] >> There's the video.
[33:42] >> Okay. How can you play it?
[33:44] >> You're awake.
[33:45] >> You want to play it?
[33:46] >> I don't know if people can hear it though.
[33:48] >> Called adenazine slowly accumulates in your brain and this adenazine binds to receptors which slow down brain activity. Ultimately, the more adenazine there is, the more tired your brain feels, which makes sense as the longer you're awake, the more fatigued you become.
[34:04] Conversely, while you sleep, the concentration of adenazine declines, gradually promoting wakefulness. But it turns out that the caffeine in your coffee is incredibly similar to adenazine in structure.
[34:16] The caffeine works its way through your bloodstream and into your brain where it starts to compete and binds with adenazine receptors. But because it's not adenazine, the sleepiness effect isn't felt. Adenazine can no longer bind, meaning its calming properties are diminished, which is great for you when you're feeling tired.
[34:34] However, with long-term use of caffeine, your brain responds by creating more adenazine receptors, which means more caffeine is required to elicit the same response. It
[34:44] >> the other thing the other thing about more adenazine receptors means that because there's more receptors available, when your body does produce adenazine, you feel more tired. You feel more tired. So, it's actually setting you up to be more tired.
[35:00] >> Also means that when you try to quit drinking coffee or miss your daily intake, you might experience some withdrawal symptoms and feel more tired than you would have before you ever drank coffee.
[35:10] But the caffeine doesn't stop there. It also stimulates the production of adrenaline. You know, the fight orflight hormone. This increases your heart rate, gets your blood pumping, and even opens up your airways.
[35:22] Furthermore, it affects dopamine levels by preventing its reabsorption in the brain, which makes you feel happy. In fact, this is the exact same thing that cocaine does, just to a lesser degree. It's a drug after all. This dopamine stimulation is also the aspect of coffee that makes it moderately addictive.
[35:40] >> The other thing with the dopamine stimulation is because you're having it every day, if you're a daily coffee drinker, then because you're used to having this dopamine fix every day from coffee, when you don't have it, you feel kind of sad.

[36:12] Well, it's actually not Wimhof breathing that I recommend. And Jay, we did the breathing this morning. So is Lee. I don't see Lee right now. But breathing gets you oxygenated. It brings more oxygen into your body. It stimulates your auto autonomic nervous system making you feel relaxed and centered and present. Is that how you felt this morning?
[36:32] >> Yeah, Jay.
[36:33] Um, gives you mental clarity, gives you an endorphin release and improves your circulation. So, breathing is a new coffee basically.

VISUAL: Gráfico de ritmo circadiano ao longo do dia
[36:44] Um, and while you're still tired despite seven or eight hours of sleep and what you can do about it. So, this is aa circadian rhythm. Circadian rhythm is basically we kind we've run by the sun. We're pretty much animals. So when the sun comes up tells our bodies, our brains, hey, wake up.
[37:02] And then throughout the day as the sun starts to go down, we start to want to wind down, relax. And at night when the sun's gone down, it's like, hey, it's time to sleep.
[37:12] Who's been who's noticed that when you go camping and there's very little light source, you just feel more tired earlier? Anyone noticed that? Yeah. That's because we're not around the artificial lights.
[37:24] The blue lights like coming from this. The artificial lights stimulate stimulate our brain like it's the sun. That's why you see cool people like Brian wearing orange blue light blocking glasses at night to block this artificial light so that your brain's like, "Oh, it's still dark." And you can get to sleep faster and easier. Yes.
[37:44] >> If you're like at home like during the week, do you recommend wearing like sweatpants and like a sweatshirt to block it from the skin as well? Like obviously It wouldn't make sense to like talk out.
[37:54] >> I see what you mean. So you're asking
[37:56] >> like hang out. Ideally, it would be like chilling in the house or the apartment.
[38:00] >> Yeah. So what's your name?
[38:02] >> Nick.
[38:03] >> So Nick is saying that at night we want to stop this artificial light from hitting our eyes but also hitting our skin. Um it affects your brain more if it hits your eyes and it affects your skin a little bit if it hits your skin.

NÚMEROS: $60, 8:00 p.m.

[38:20] Ideally, at night you can just create orange light bulbs, which I think Jeremy has in his um bedroom. If you have orange light bulbs, it pulls out the um blue light, which is a stimulating light. You can do that or candles is a really nice way.
[38:36] There's actually um a type of light bulb called the Philips Hue light. They're really expensive, like 60 bucks each, I think around there. But what they do is you can set them to change color at certain times.
[38:48] So, that's what I tell that's what I tell my clients like, "Hey, just put these in like the main rooms you're going to be in at night, and then whenever the sun goes down, let's say it's about 8:00 p.m. here in Florida, they'll just automatically switch to the red light or orange light so that it's not stimulating you and you can get to sleep um a lot easier and have higher sleep quality.

[39:28] So, it's actually one of the most powerful anti-cancer hormones or drugs available. It's melatonin. And every time that you go to sleep and you're not protecting your eyes from the blue light with orange light bulbs or the orange glasses, I recommend Swanic Sleep.
