[00:00] So, just the other day, uh, I'm doing a podcast with the, uh, Fresh and Fit guys. Everybody know them? They're coming over here later today, I think. Uh, you know, feel free to say hello and introduce yourself. They're pretty cool guys.
 
[00:20] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Fresh and Fit Podcast Example"
 
NÚMEROS: $30/month subscription, $1M/month goal = 33,333 people needed
 
VISUAL: Cálculo de math impossível: $1M ÷ $30 = 33,333 subscribers necessários, comparação de difficulty
 
 
[00:25] Um, to be clear, you know what they asked me? They said, "Hey, I got this uh, I don't even remember how much it was. is such a pleb number, dude. It was like 30 bucks a month or something like that. Like some kind of subscription for 30 bucks a month. And they were like, "How do we how do we market the 30 bucks a month thing, you know? Like, how do we make more money with the 30 bucks a month shit?"
 
[01:00] And I was like, "Are you serious?" And they were like, "Yeah." And I was like, "How much are you trying to make?" And they were like, "Dude, we'd love to hit million-dollar months." And I just pulled out my phone, okay? And I did the math. I'll do the math for you right here so you can see the same math.
 
[01:25] I was like, "So, you want you want a million dollars off of $30 a month?" So, you take a million dollars gross and you divide it by 30. How many people they need signed up, Mason? 33,000. $33,333 people. Okay. Does that sound easy? Right. When you're trying to make a million dollars a month, why would you want it to be hard? Does that make any fucking sense?
 
[02:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Fresh and Fit Alternative Offer Structure"
 
NÚMEROS: Offer 1: $25K mastermind, Offer 2: $100K done-for-you setup, Offer 3: $250K full branded setup
 
VISUAL: Three-tier pricing strategy, podcast setup expertise, technical + concept + distribution teaching
 
 
[02:05] You know, so I just, you know, without trying to roast them or be disrespectful, I love the Fresh and Fit Guys. I was like, "I don't know, man. This seems pretty fucking It doesn't make much sense to me. I think that you should push for a higher ticket product." And they were like, "Well, what what are you thinking? Like some kind of like course?"
 
[02:35] And I was like, "Okay, I only thinking selling to rich people ideally. What would rich people buy from the fresh and fit guys?" It's a simple question I prompted myself with. Okay. You know the answer I came up with? Tell me if you think that this is shit or you think it's a good idea.
 
[03:00] I said, "Okay, two things. Number one, a 25K offer where it's like a mastermind with the Fresh and Fit guys, but what they do is three things. They show if you've ever seen their studio, it's fucking insane. Like they get these apartments in downtown Miami. You they first one they rented, the second one they now bought, and they fucking deck them out.
 
[03:35] Like you walk into their apartment, it just feels like a giant fucking studio. Doesn't even feel like somebody lives there, but somehow they do. Okay, they have so much equipment in this place. There's speakers, microphones, like infinite fucking wires you can't even see. They have the technical part down.
 
[04:05] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Three Components of $25K Mastermind"
 
NÚMEROS: $25K offer = 3 components
 
VISUAL: 1. Podcast concept (what it should be about), 2. Technicals (setup/equipment), 3. Distribution (how to grow)
 
 
[04:10] I told him three things. I said, "Dude, 25K offer. You talk to them about the concept of like what the podcast should be about cuz they got that down well, too." These guys did like six podcasts just that day alone when we showed up around like 8:00 p.m. They have the technicals down, which would be like the actual how to set it all up and do all that crazy shit
 
[04:40] And then the third thing, which would be the distribution, like how to actually grow it. And I said, "Do you guys not see how obvious of an offer that'd be for some rich folks that would pay you 25K to learn all this shit?" Like, is that dumb or is that smart? Right?
 
[05:10] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Done-For-You Upsell Logic"
 
NÚMEROS: $100K base setup, $250K full branded setup
 
VISUAL: Rich people don't want DIY, rat nest wiring complexity, audio engineers, custom graphics, 4 platforms streaming, staff behind scenes
 
 
[05:15] Okay, watch this. And then I said, "Okay, now the problem's going to be when you're selling to rich folks. They don't really want to do it themselves. They'd rather have you do it in comparison to have to do all that work." Think about the amount of shit that you'd have to do. I can't even put it to words in a short period of time.
 
[05:45] How much like once again like rat nest wiring is in that place. They had audio engineers. They had so many people that were like staffed behind the scenes manning like all this crazy ass equipment. They had custom graphics. They were streaming on like four platforms at once and it was smooth. Like this was money. Okay.
 
[06:20] My point being, do you think a rich person would want to set that up themselves after they learn it all too? So what would the upsell be? So I tell them, I go, "Bro, $100,000. Okay, you fucking dispatch these audio people that you've got hired and they set the full thing up for people. Okay, 100K."
 
[06:55] And then I told him, I kind of like was explaining it and I was like, "You know what? I really think it could be more expensive than that. I said, cuz this is like some crazy next level shit I think you could go all the way up to like 250, you know, and I think the right person like there's levels to it, right?
 
[07:25] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Pricing Tiers Breakdown"
 
NÚMEROS: $100K = base setup, $250K = full Fresh & Fit branded room
 
VISUAL: Níveis de investimento, full branding para $250K, objeções de skepticism
 
 
[07:30] 100k gets you like a pretty base setup and like 250 gets you like the full fucking fresh like they would they would make this entire room like branded for whatever the podcast is as an example for 250. You know what I mean? And they're sitting there and they're wrapping their mind around it. They're like, and then some skepticism starts to come up, you know?
 
[08:00] Well, man, you know, I don't really want to teach people how to do this shit And I'm like, the fuck you think they're not going to come out with podcasts anyway? You know, like, what are you afraid of? They're going to copy the Fresh and Fit podcast to the tea. Like, you get to vet everybody who buys. Shouldn't be scared about selling this kind of shit you know?
 
[08:35] Like, if anything, you should be enthused about the fact that you just found a way to make a million dollars with 10 people buying, you know? I was like, think about this. Think about think about and I started just naming people. Everybody familiar with Tom Cruz, the section 8 guy?
 
[09:05] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Buyer Examples - Tom Cruz, Lil Mason"
 
NÚMEROS: 10 people at $100K = $1M (vs 33,333 at $30)
 
VISUAL: Naming specific rich people who would buy, "no money for these guys", $25K = downsell for people who think they can DIY
 
 
[09:10] I was like, "You don't think Tom Cruz would splash 100K on a fucking podcast setup like that?" Started naming people like you. I was like, "Dude, Lil Mason, dog." I was like, "You don't think he splash 100 on it?" I was like, "It's it's no money for these guys." And I was like, "And it makes total fucking sense to have the complete done for you setup."
 
[09:45] And I was like, "The I honestly don't even think the 25k would be the focal point. I think it'd be the drop cell for the people who don't want to splash the hundred, who think they could do it themselves." Does that make sense? Okay. Then this got me thinking, right?
 
[10:15] Because every time I come to a mastermind, I think I'm like, "What can I talk to you guys about that's going to make a big fucking difference in what you do?" And I just I looked at what I told the Fresh and Fit guys and it made so much sense when I looked at every single thing that most of you do.
 
[10:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Small Ball Offers Problem"
 
NÚMEROS: Most don't get equity, no rev share, just couple grand
 
VISUAL: Diagnóstico: everyone playing small ball, não entendem incentives properly, helping people make money but getting little
 
 
[10:50] You guys play fucking small ball. Every single offer you have, it's just a little fucking small ball offer, you know? And most of you aren't getting equity in the businesses you help. Like most of you, like some of you guys, as an example, make people so much money, you know, or you help them with whatever it is they're hiring you to do, you don't even get a rev share. Like you get like a couple grand, you don't understand incentives properly. Okay.
 
[11:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Jeremy's Offer Comparison"
 
NÚMEROS: Master Internet Marketing: $5K, Inner Circle: $36K/year (now)
 
VISUAL: Comparação de incentives: quanto Jeremy é incentivado a fazer você ganhar baseado em quanto você paga
 
 
[11:35] So, look at the difference here. If, as an example, let's just let's just look at my offers with the master internet marketing offer that cost 5K versus the inner circle, which is now 36K year offer. Okay, think about the differences here from an incentive perspective. What am I incentivized to do based on the amount you pay each month? How much money?
 
[12:10] No. How much money am I probable to make you based on how little you pay me? Think about the incentives. You pay a little shit like 2K, 3K, 4K a month, give or take who you are and when you joined. What am I probable to make you every month? More than that just right well I obviously want to make you more than that right because that's what helps you stay a part of the group
 
[12:50] Whether you want to acknowledge the incentives of your offers or not you have to because at the end of the day like I've seen tremendous growth from many of you over the years some of you to be clear that have been in here a while like I've literally watched go from under 100k a month to like multi000 some of you already above 100k when you join in here you literally exceeded a million dollars shame by the way you haven't to be clear
 
[13:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Agency Rev Share Reality"
 
NÚMEROS: First $200K wire = transformation
 
VISUAL: Jeremy's personal experience: $200K wire → became money demon, prioritized that relationship, made more for that account than any flat fee account
 
 
[13:35] It is unbearable to think, you know, that, okay, based on my own offer, the same lesson applies to be clear, and I'm not going to fuck all of you and do rev shares, you know, I'm not you're all grandfathered to be clear. But my point being, think about this, okay? How much more of a fuck would I give about making you more money if I did have some kind of upside incentive?
 
[14:10] Much more fuck right? But really think about it. Cuz I, as an example, in my client deals I do on the agency side, I'm a fucking monster. I do a tremendous amount of shit I have a level of performance none of you even witnessed before because again I'm incentivized to have that level of performance. Does that make sense?
 
[14:45] To be clear, 5K for the master internet marketing program. What am I incentivized to do when you fuck me like that and only give me 5K for a set of skills that can make you infinite fucking money for the rest of your life? What am I probable to do for you? Just based on incentives, nothing. I'm probable to make you at least 5K back, right? Yeah. Make you feel good about the investment.
 
[15:25] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Prioritization System"
 
NÚMEROS: Não especificado
 
VISUAL: Hierarchy: Agency clients first → Inner Circle second → Master Internet Marketing last, prioritization based on incentives
 
 
[15:30] But to be clear, it's like again, you know, I'll answer your questions. If you're in the master internet marketing group, you'll see like people post a question. Obviously, I'm going to answer your questions first is the inner circle. But obviously, I'm going to answer my client questions first before I answer inner circle questions. And then to be clear, it's like a prioritization system. You see that?
 
[16:05] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Exercise: Write Your Offer Incentives"
 
NÚMEROS: Não especificado
 
VISUAL: Exercise time, perguntas: What are incentives? What supposed to help do? What does offer encourage making back? Result timeline? What probable to do for somebody?
 
 
[16:10] So, my point being, when you look at your own offers, I just want you to take a note real quick. What are the incentives of your offer? What are you supposed to help people do? What's your offer encourage you to make somebody back? What's the result timeline? Take a moment and I want you to truly write it down. What are you probable to do for somebody? Really think about this.
 
[16:50] The Fresh and Fit Guys at 30 bucks a month. What the fuck are they going to do for 30 bucks a month for a person? They help people tremendously on their podcast, but how much more of a fuck would they give if they were doing 25K deals or 100K setups or 250K setups?
 
[17:20] So, I ask you simply, do you actually think you're performing at the fucking level you could? Here's the thing. When I started doing agency rev shares, I honestly I was shocked the first time I had a $200,000 wire come in my account. Do you know what it did for me? Dude, I became like a fucking money demon.
 
[17:55] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Money Demon Transformation"
 
NÚMEROS: $200K wire = transformation point
 
VISUAL: Transformation story: prioritized all attention on that relationship, prioritized similar deals, made more than any other account, expanded potential
 
 
[18:00] I was like, "Oh my god, I'm going to scale this guy's business to like infinite amounts, you know? Are you kidding me?" Like, I can get $200,000 off a fucking account. I prioritized all my attention on that relationship. I prioritized all the other deals that could be anywhere remotely close to it. I made more money for that account than any other account that I had that wasn't a revshare at the time when I was making that transition.
 
[18:40] You know, every single thing fucking came out of me that never came out of me before. Simply put, I was incentivized to expand my potential. I ask you a simple question. Why have you been stuck? You know, why do you barely fucking grow?

You don't have an upsell yet. You didn't do what we talked about last time. You got the You got to inerson, fucking it's been three fucking months.
 
[19:50] Did you make a million dollars off that new offer I talked to you about last time? No. I gave you a super high ticket, like clean offer that would bring a better fucking Mason to the table. You understand the potential part of what I'm talking about, right?
 
[20:20] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Mason's Current Reality"
 
NÚMEROS: Consistent claims: ~$10K, Charges: $10K
 
VISUAL: Incentivized to barely make people money, barely making people money, what if charged $10K? What would claim be? Why don't changes happen naturally?
 
 
[20:25] You right now, dude, like you're you're essentially incentivized to barely make people money. You're barely making people money. Like your consistent claims are like 10K. What if you charge 10K? What would the claim be then? What would you have to tweak with your product? Why don't these changes happen naturally? Because you're not incentivized to do it. Does that make sense?

[21:45] I'm talking to Brendan the other day. He joins in. He has a similar offer when it comes to like an inner circle type program. He's only charging $1,000 a month. What the fuck you think he's supposed to do with people who only make $1,000 a month with him? What What's he incentivized to make people back?
 
[22:20] Talk. It's like I told him clear as day. I was like, "Bro, you could be charging revshare relationships. You could have these milestones where you get equity in their business. You could help people exit from the business that you help them grow." And guess what?
 
[22:50] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Milestone-Based Agreements"
 
NÚMEROS: Não especificado
 
VISUAL: Concept: start at current level, if help get to next level = unlock additional incentive, makes it fair and probable to give fuck
 
 
[22:55] Are you guys Let me give you a perfect example. You join into the inner circle. Are you probable to give me a rev share in equity right off the bat? No. Say it loud. No. What would make you do that though? Maybe like a milestone, right?
 
[23:30] Where if I'm like, "All right, so you're at you're at this right now." Okay, if I help you get to this, that unlocks for me some type of additional incentive. What's that then do for our deal? I'm going to do it 100%. It makes it more probable I'm going to give a fuck about you hitting that greater level, too, cuz I have something to work for for it.
 
[24:05] And guess what it also does? Does that make it fair? If you come in, you're making like whatever, fucking 100K a month, 500K a month, and I'm like, "All right, you get to this amount in revenue." Okay, the goal after that is to help you exit or to help you get to this next milestone above that. When you go from that level you're currently at to that next level, I want this to unlock. Is that fair? Tell me for real. Is that fair?
 
[24:45] Yeah. Anybody disagree? No. See what I'm saying? Milestonebased agreements where if something happens, you pay me more. Does that make sense?
 
[25:10] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "James Swanwick Example"
 
NÚMEROS: Charges: $15,000 to stop drinking, Financial upside trackable
 
VISUAL: Abstract offer não tied to revenue, financial upside de cutting alcohol, anecdotal sharing vs trackable system
 
 
[25:15] So, look at these offers in like more abstract offers that aren't necessarily directly tied to revenue. James helps people stop drinking. How much you charge? 15,000. So for $15,000 helping somebody cut out alcohol completely, there's a financial upside to that. That's how you that's how you articulate it, right? Yes.
 
[25:50] Do you track that financial upside? They share that with us anecdotally. Yes. To be clear, every person who signs up, do you have some trackable system where you can go in and say, "Look, this person spent 15 with us. This is how much more money they made, and they've been sober for this amount of time." How much more value do you think you could extract from your existing customer base if you did that?
 
[26:30] Considerably more. What could you sell them after they made certain amount? Because you can in a trackable way, you could say, "Look, you paid us 15K. You got sober. This amount of time passed. Look how much more money you made. I have this other offer now where the same logic's going to occur. I'm going to help you get to this next milestone."
 
[27:05] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "James' Missed Opportunity"
 
NÚMEROS: $952K (missed $1M by $48K), Would have gotten $6M/month trophy
 
VISUAL: So close to trophy, trackable revenue based on cutting alcohol = easier upsell, how much easier past $1M/month?
 
 
[27:10] And that could be they're already seller, James. Well, you sell them after that. We sell them personal development, but we could sell them a business program. Such a shame. By the way, James was about $48,000 off from receiving a $6 million a month trophy, but they whiffed it. Okay, they got to $950 something,000. That fucking close. Would have been sick to give him a trophy here today.
 
[27:50] But watch this. Watch this. Okay, that offer, that 15K offer, trackable revenue based on cutting out alcohol, and then an upsell from there. How much easier would that make it to always get past a million a month? How obvious would it be once again for that person to say yes on the other side of that? How much more incentivized do you think they'd be to help somebody get that trackable result if they actually tracked it?
 
[28:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Incentives + Tracking = Core Components"
 
NÚMEROS: Não especificado
 
VISUAL: Two parts: 1. Incentives, 2. Tracking, both critical for maximizing performance
 
 
[28:35] That's the second part of this whole thing. Incentives. Tracking. Tracking. I talked to you when you first joined in. I said, "Okay, so you're getting people. You want to explain your business model to the group in a loud way?"
 
[29:00] Yeah. So, I I do cold outreach. So we'll book appointments for our clients. We have some clients are investment bankers. We're helping facilitate deals and we have like bunch of working. How much money did the investment banker make when they did a deal with you?
 
[29:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Investment Banker Case Study"
 
NÚMEROS: Banker made: 7 figures, Paid: $3K/month, Total earned: ~$25K, Tens of thousands in commissions per deal
 
VISUAL: Getting absolutely fucked because couldn't track measurable result, unspecific numbers, no tracking = no leverage
 
 
[29:35] Probably like seven figures. Now you hear that word in the in the roundabout number that's unspecific. How much that guy pay you? Three damn a month. How much do you make off that deal in total? Probably like 25k.
 
[30:10] So because you couldn't track a measurable result that you made the guy when he potentially did seven figure deals, paid himself at least tens of thousands in a commission off of each deal that he helped facilitate, you got absolutely fucking cuz you didn't track anything. You track everything now. How much more you charge now?
 
[30:45] I raised my price by like double. So to be clear, only double, right? How easy is it to double it again if you found out from consistently tracking that you're actually making people even more money than what they're paying you? Now again, would you raise it again? 100%.
 
[31:20] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Accounting Business Example"
 
NÚMEROS: Charges: couple hundred dollars, Makes clients: $100K/year forever if they do work
 
VISUAL: $1,300 highest ticket offer, getting absolutely fucked, $100K/year forever for $1,300
 
 
[31:25] To be clear, tracking. When you do the accounting shit you track the revenue that you make these people when they sign up for these fucking couple hundred offers. 100% of people that sign up, you track. Why you Why Why you aren't charging a couple thousand dollar?
 
[32:00] Uh, I don't know. Because you don't fucking know how much you're making people. Yeah, that's fact. Charging a couple hundred bucks. I mean, our offer easily, our $1,300 offer, which is our highest ticket offer, by the way. Fucking I agree. Uh, if they do the work, they can make a year forever.
 
[32:35] So, they pay you $1,300 and they make $100,000 a year forever. Yeah. Yeah. You want to bend over and just show everybody your ass, you know, so we could all see how wide it is from the amount of fist you get in there. I mean, holy shit $1,300 for 100k a year.

[33:50] Okay, I guess you got a lot of buyers here. To be clear, think about this. Okay, apparently a lot of you don't even know the upsides of not drinking, but it's pretty extreme. Okay, I've seen a lot of people go through his group. I've seen a lot of people go through Mark Jennison's group who's also a part of the IC here who also helps people cut out alcohol that have made seriously guys like a fuckload of money on the other side of cutting out alcohol depending on to which the degree of they drink.
 
[34:35] You know, if they drink a lot, even if they drink a little, you know, it can make a tremendous difference to their income is my point. But to be clear, they don't even know how much they're making people on the other side of that investment. What if it was just as bad as his? What did you think of that when you heard it? $1,300, James, for $100,000 a year forever. How fucked is that? What if you were doing the same? How would you know?

[37:10] What if you were making people such a tremendous amount greater than $100,000 a year for a small percentage of your customers? Let's say 10% of them. How many customers you got? thousand 10% of them, 100 people make 500 grand a year off what you're teaching them.
 
[37:45] What if you knew that? What would that make you do faster? I would definitely start tracking. I would extract more value from those fucking customers, right? So to be clear, incentives and tracking, you get what I'm saying?

NÚMEROS: $100K-$250K setup, Goal: $1M podcast revenue, Then: rev share unlocks
 
VISUAL: Track podcast revenue as part of deal, help make $1M first, then rev share + staff + more involvement
 
 
[38:20] Listen to this. Milestonebased performance. Let's go back to the fresh and fit guys. 100k or 250k. Wouldn't it be smart? Like what's the point of spending the 100 to 250? What's the what's the point of spending that amount on a podcast setup? What's the point of the podcast?
 
[38:55] Make money off the podcast. Make fucking money off the podcast, right? What would be smart for them to do after they sell somebody on 100 to 250k? Track the fucking podcast revenue, right? That's a part of the deal. Hey, we're going to help you track all this shit so you know how much money is coming from it, right? Smart for them to do. So they can then do what?
 
[39:35] I'll tell you what, dude. Outside of the 100 to 250k you're gonna pay us for the podcast setup, I want you to make a million off this podcast. And if I can help you get there, I want to give more of a fuck about your podcast. I want you to give me a rev share. And I'm going to put people on your staff. I'm going to talk to you more frequently. I'm going to help push that shit up to the next level, but I want to help make you a million first off that investment you've made. Is that fair?
 
[40:20] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Why Does Game Have to Stop?"
 
NÚMEROS: $250K = nothing when making back $1M
 
VISUAL: Milestone unlocks greater incentive, tracked, game doesn't stop at initial sale, why think only $30/month?
 
 
[40:25] Right? The 250 is fucking nothing when you're going to make back a million. And then the deal after the million makes sense, too, because again, they're going to have an incentive. They're going to have it tracked. And it's a milestone-based agreement that unlocks after you get your return for whatever you agree to return to somebody. Whatever the result is, even if it's not money, that then unlocks an even greater incentive, right? Why does the game have to stop? That's the point.
 
[41:05] Why the fuck would they think it's only $30 a month? Why wouldn't they naturally think of the 25k, the 100k? Why does it take somebody like me to think that? Why does it take somebody like me to tell you you can make way more fucking money? Because you don't have an incentive to. You made up your price. You made it up, right? Why wouldn't you make up something even better for yourself that can make you even more fucking money? Cuz you don't have an incentive to. You know, you don't have a fucking incentive to give a fuck Does that make sense?

NÚMEROS: Almost tapped $1M last month, 250 customers, 70% made money back ($20-30K initial)
 
VISUAL: What happened? Couldn't be immigrants/Indians excuse, how many made money back? What tried to sell them since?
 
 
[41:55] You almost tapped a million last month, Kade. What happened? Why didn't you go over a million? Couldn't be the immigrants coming through your funnel, like you said. Couldn't be the Indians. What was it?
 
[42:25] Kate hits me up. Oh, dude. I got fucking hammered by like I did a warehouse ad. I got fucking slammed by Indian people now. I don't know what happened. Do I have to launch a new pixel? That that can't fuck your business. That can't be the excuse. What else could have been done? How many customers you got, Kade?
 
[42:55] 250. How many of them already made their money back? 70%. 70%. 200 people. How much did they initially spend with you? I'm sorry. How much did they initially spend with you? 20 to 30,000.
 
[43:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Kade's Missed Opportunity"
 
NÚMEROS: 70% of 250 customers made $20-30K back, Takes profit share but no additional upsell
 
VISUAL: Already made back investment, in pure profit now, can't think of anything else to sell? Why not two profit share things?
 
 
[43:35] So, you made 70% of people 20 to $30,000 back already. What have you tried to sell them since? Insane. It makes no sense. How do you not come up with something else? Why wouldn't you try to extract more value?
 
[44:10] We do take a profit share. I don't give a fuck Why wouldn't you sell them something else, too? You already made them back the initial investment. They're in pure profit now. You can't think of anything else to sell them. Give them two things that you can get profit share on. Why one? You get what I'm saying?
 
[44:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Exercise Requirements"
 
NÚMEROS: Não especificado
 
VISUAL: Leave room with: 1. Proper incentive, 2. Trackable system, 3. Milestone that unlocks at certain number
 
 
[44:50] Again, you leave this room, you have a clearly defined upsell that says I can number one have a proper incentive. Number two, I can track it. And number three, there's some kind of milestone that unlocks when I hit a certain fucking number with you. Does that make sense? What's it going to be? Take a minute and try to come up with it.
 
[45:25] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Parkinson's Law Example"
 
NÚMEROS: Elon: built rocket in 8 months, Ferrari guy: 4 months and counting
 
VISUAL: Ferrari in shop 4 months, Elon built giant self-landing rocket in 8 months, time constraint = completion
 
 
[45:30] There's a good concept, right? I'll give you an example. I have two Ferraris. One of them's in the shop for the last 4 months. I fucking hate it. Do you know that Elon Musk built a fucking giant rocket that just landed itself in eight fucking months? My guy can't fix a Ferrari in four. You know how up his ass I am? I'm like, dog, YOU'RE HALFWAY TO BUILDING A FUCKING ROCKET that can land itself and you can't fucking get my Ferrari back to me in time.
 
[46:15] Why does that work for Elon and not for my fucking Ferrari guy? Cuz he follows Parkinson's law. Okay, Parkinson's law is the fact that you put a time constraint on something and with that time constraint, you get it done in the amount of time you allocate for that thing to get done.
 
[46:45] So again, as ridiculous as a minute might sound to make yourself a fuckload more money than what you're making right now, take the minute right now and come up with it. Does that make sense? You go right now.
 
[47:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Live Exercise - Coming Up With Offers"
 
NÚMEROS: Variados por participante
 
VISUAL: Participantes criando offers ao vivo, Jeremy criticando/refinando cada um, focus em incentives + tracking + milestones
 
 
[47:20] What is it? So, I would take all people who come through all of our higher level products and I would offer them a 5k almost like done with you business building program and talk about doing this. What's the incentive?
 
[47:50] The incentive would be uh we'll help them get to $100,000 a year consistent income. We'll help we'll introduce all the processes, proposals, all that stuff and drive leads for them and we'll take 30% on the back end.
 
[48:20] You track it, they hit 100K, then what? We take 30% of all the business after the 800k. Yeah, forever. What's the milestone after that that makes you earn the 30%.
 
[48:50] Didn't think about that. I was just thinking like 30% of whatever comes in. I didn't tack on an additional milestone above that. It's good to create an additional milestone above that cuz that's what makes the 30% worth giving you.

📊 RESUMO EXECUTIVO
 
NÚMEROS PRINCIPAIS:
 
Fresh and Fit Case Study:
Current offer: $30/month subscription
Goal: $1M/month
Required subscribers: 33,333 people ($1M ÷ $30)
Jeremy's alternative Offer 1: $25K mastermind (3 components: concept + technicals + distribution)
Jeremy's alternative Offer 2: $100K done-for-you base setup
Jeremy's alternative Offer 3: $250K full branded setup
New math: 10 people at $100K = $1M (vs 33,333 at $30)
6 podcasts filmed in single day when Jeremy visited
 
Jeremy's Offers Comparison:
Master Internet Marketing: $5K
Inner Circle: $36K/year (current pricing)
Agency first big rev share: $200K wire (transformational moment)
 
Member Examples:
Mason: charges $5K, no upsell, consistent claims ~$10K
Brendan: charges $1,000/month for inner circle type program
James Swanwick: charges $15K to stop drinking, got to $952K (missed $1M by $48K)
Investment banker client: made 7 figures, paid $3K/month, total earned ~$25K
Accounting business: charges $1,300, makes clients $100K/year forever
Jesse (trading): made $395K in a month, doesn't track student results, launching mastermind Q1 25
Kade: 250 customers, 70% made $20-30K back, almost hit $1M last month, takes profit share but no additional upsell
 
Parkinson's Law Example:
Elon Musk: built self-landing rocket in 8 months
Ferrari repair guy: 4 months and counting (still not done)
 
ESTRATÉGIAS E SISTEMAS:
 
Core Framework - Three Components:
 
INCENTIVES (Proper Alignment)
What are you incentivized to do based on what client pays?
How much probable to make them based on payment?
Fresh and Fit: $30/month = what can you do? vs $25K-$250K = completely different incentive
Jeremy's transformation: $200K wire = became "money demon"
Prioritized that relationship above all others
Made more for that account than any flat fee account
Every single thing came out that never came before
Incentivized to expand potential
Question: Why have you been stuck? Why barely grow?
Answer: Not incentivized to perform at higher level
 
TRACKING (Measurable Results)
Investment banker case: made 7 figures, but unspecific = got fucked ($3K/month for $25K total)
Now tracks everything = doubled prices (still should double again)
Accounting business: doesn't track $100K/year result = charges $1,300
Jesse trading: doesn't track student results = only has $1,300 offer
James: anecdotal sharing vs trackable system
If tracked: could extract more value, easier upsell, clearer path to $1M+/month
Hypothetical: what if 10% of 1,000 customers make $500K/year? Would track faster, extract more
Tools for advertisers: Hyros, CRM with unique tags, triangulate truth
For non-advertisers: accountability coaches, input from consumers, can't lie about results
 
MILESTONE-BASED AGREEMENTS (Unlocking Greater Incentives)
Start at current level
If help get to next level = unlock additional incentive
Makes it fair and probable to give fuck
Example: Join Inner Circle, not probable to give rev share immediately
But if Jeremy helps hit milestone = unlocks rev share/equity
Makes deal more probable, incentivizes pushing to greater level
Fresh and Fit example: $100K-$250K setup → track podcast revenue → help make $1M → unlocks rev share + more involvement
$250K = nothing when making back $1M
Milestone unlocks greater incentive
Why does game have to stop after initial sale?
Earn ability to ask for percentage by promising next harder thing
 
Fresh and Fit Three-Tier Strategy:
 
Offer 1: $25K Mastermind (3 Components)
Component 1: Podcast concept (what it should be about) - they have this down
Component 2: Technicals (actual setup, equipment, rat nest wiring, audio engineers, custom graphics, streaming 4 platforms)
Component 3: Distribution (how to grow it)
Target: rich people who want to learn
 
Offer 2: $100K Done-For-You Base Setup
Rich people don't want DIY after learning
Dispatch audio people to set full thing up
Base level setup
Examples of buyers: Tom Cruz (Section 8), Lil Mason
"No money for these guys"
 
Offer 3: $250K Full Branded Setup
Full Fresh & Fit level branding
Make entire room branded for podcast
Levels to investment
 
Post-Setup Strategy:
Track podcast revenue as part of deal
Help make $1M off podcast first
Then unlock rev share
More involvement: put people on staff, talk more frequently, help push to next level
Fair deal: $250K nothing when making back $1M
 
Overcoming Skepticism:
"Don't want to teach people this" → They'll make podcasts anyway
Get to vet everybody who buys
Found way to make $1M with 10 people (vs 33,333)
$25K = downsell for people who think can DIY
$100K-$250K = focal point
 
Jeremy's Agency Rev Share Model:
Trackable back to actions Jeremy takes
Don't take revenue from what client already does
Baseline: whatever already making = don't care
Only revenue from actions trackable back to agency
If client argues fairness (already getting 4x ROAS) = do what's fair
When get clients to consistent $1M months = help consider exit
Had 3 deals get $40M+ exits, got cut out (no equity)
Now: get ahead of it, help exit, get chunk of equity + lump sum
Not just finder fee = deserves equity for growing to $1M/month
 
Prioritization System (Jeremy's Reality):
Agency clients (highest incentive)
Inner Circle (medium incentive)
Master Internet Marketing (lowest incentive - just make feel good about $5K)
Whether you acknowledge incentives or not, you have to
Tremendous growth seen in Inner Circle over years
Some: under $100K/month → multi-million
Some: already above $100K → exceeded $1M/month
 
Time Constraint Strategy (Parkinson's Law):
Put time constraint on something = get it done in allocated time
Elon: 8 months for self-landing rocket
Ferrari guy: 4 months, still not done
Exercise: 1 minute to come up with new offer (as ridiculous as sounds)
Creates urgency and forces clarity
 
ESTRUTURA:
 
Session Objective:
Everyone walks out with much bigger, cleaner, better incentivized offer
Based on performance being expanded upon
Clear as day going to make expand into potential
Three requirements:
Proper incentive (you actually give fuck about)
Trackable system
Milestone that unlocks at certain number
 
Small Ball Problem Diagnosis:
Everyone playing small ball offers
Most don't get equity in businesses they help
Most don't get rev share
Just couple grand
Don't understand incentives properly
Make people so much money but get little
Help with whatever hired to do but no upside
 
Question Framework for Offers:
What are incentives of your offer?
What are you supposed to help people do?
What does offer encourage you to make somebody back?
What's result timeline?
What are you probable to do for somebody?
Do you actually think performing at fucking level you could?
 
Why Changes Don't Happen Naturally:
Not incentivized to do it
Made up price
Why not make up something better?
Don't have incentive to give fuck
Been stuck, barely growing
Just fucking off, traveling around
Didn't do what talked about last time
No upsell yet (months later)
 
Upsell Logic for Different Business Types:
 
Abstract Offers (Not Revenue-Tied):
James example: stop drinking for $15K
Financial upside exists (trackable)
Currently: anecdotal sharing
Should be: trackable system (how much more money made, sober time)
Then: sell them after certain revenue milestone
Personal development → business program upsell
Tracking makes upsell obvious and easier
 
Service-Based Offers:
Cold outreach/appointment booking
Investment banker: facilitated 7-figure deals
Should track: how much banker made per deal
Then: charge based on tracked results (doubled prices, should double again)
Milestone: after certain revenue = unlock higher tier
 
Education/Course Offers:
Accounting: $1,300 → clients make $100K/year forever (getting fucked)
Trading: $1,300 offer, doesn't track results, launching mastermind Q1
Should track: 10% of customers making $500K/year? Extract more value
Milestone: after $50K profits → coach directly → mastermind upsell
 
E-commerce/Agency Offers:
Kade: 250 customers, 70% made $20-30K back
Takes profit share but no additional upsell
Already in pure profit = perfect time for upsell
Why not two profit share things instead of one?
 
Live Exercise Structure:
Take moment, write down incentives
Come up with new offer structure
Jeremy critiques each person's offer
Refines based on three components
Common mistake: forget milestone after initial unlock
Need: what makes them give you percentage? (next harder thing you'll help with)
 
Exit Strategy Layer:
Beyond cash flow from offers
Help client exit = lump sum
Exit agency itself = lump sum
Multiple exit potentials for lump sums
Not just finder fee (6%) = chunk of equity for growing business to exit point
 
DADOS FINANCEIROS:
 
Fresh and Fit Economics:
Current: $30/month × 33,333 people = $1M/month (impossible)
Alternative: $100K × 10 people = $1M/month (achievable)
Or: mix of $25K, $100K, $250K offers
6 podcasts per day = volume capability
Downtown Miami apartments: first rented, second bought
Massive equipment investment already made
 
Jeremy's Transformation Moment:
First $200K wire from rev share
Became "money demon"
Prioritized that relationship above all
Made more for that account than any flat fee account
Every single thing came out that never came before
Expanded potential through proper incentive
 
Member Financial Realities:
 
Mason:
Charges: $5K
Consistent claims: ~$10K results
No upsell (3 months after being told)
Incentivized to barely make people money
Barely making people money
Just traveling, fucking off
Potential untapped
 
Brendan:
Charges: $1,000/month
Inner circle type program
What incentivized to make back at $1K/month?
Should: revshare, milestones, equity, help exit
 
James Swanwick:
Charges: $15K to stop drinking
Last month: $952K (missed $1M by $48K)
Would have gotten $6M/month trophy
Doesn't track financial upside of sobriety
Anecdotal sharing only
Sells personal development after
Should sell: business program with trackable revenue milestone
 
Investment Banker Client:
Made: 7 figures from deals
Paid: $3K/month
Total earned by service provider: ~$25K
Tens of thousands in commissions per deal for banker
Got absolutely fucked because didn't track
Now tracks everything: doubled prices
Should double again based on tracked results
 
Accounting Business:
Charges: $1,300 (highest ticket offer)
Makes clients: $100K/year forever (if do work)
Getting absolutely fucked
Doesn't track results
No upsell (launching mastermind Q1)
Don't know how fucked getting
Hypothetical: 10% of 1,000 customers = 100 people making $500K/year
If knew: would track faster, extract more value
 
Jesse (Trading):
Jeremy made: $395K in a month (not lifetime)
Jesse: doesn't track student results
Has: $1,300 offer only
Launching: mastermind Q1 25
No wonder doesn't have upsell yet (doesn't know results)
Only has $1,300 because doesn't know how fucked getting
 
Kade:
Customers: 250
Made money back: 70% ($20-30K initial investment)
Last month: almost hit $1M
Takes: profit share
Problem: no additional upsell
Clients in pure profit now
Can't think of anything else to sell
Why not two profit share things?
 
Pricing Evolution Examples:
Investment banker guy: tracked → doubled prices → should double again
Fresh and Fit: $30/month → should be $25K-$250K
Mason: $5K → should be $10K+ with proper upsell
Brendan: $1,000/month → should have revshare/equity/exit help
Accounting: $1,300 → should be thousands (making clients $100K/year)
 
Exit Deal Values:
Jeremy had 3 clients get $40M+ exits
Got cut out (no equity locked in)
Chunk of equity for growing to $1M/month = couple million at exit
Not just 6% finder fee
Lump sum on top of cash flow
 
ROI Scenarios:
$250K podcast setup when making back $1M = nothing
$15K stop drinking when making back hundreds of thousands = underpriced
$1,300 accounting when making $100K/year forever = getting fucked
$5K agency when making client millions = underpriced
