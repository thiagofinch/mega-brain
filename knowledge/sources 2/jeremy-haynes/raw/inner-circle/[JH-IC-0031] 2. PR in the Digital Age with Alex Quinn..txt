Transcrição Completa: PR in the Digital Age with Alex Quinn
[00:00] Appreciate that, Jeremy. All righty, guys. I'm Alex Quinn. I've been in the digital marketing space for 15 years now. Pretty much started out of high school. 30 years old now. Been running a marketing agency for 10 years.
[00:20] And um about 2 years into running the marketing agency, I realized that there was a lot of influence in being a contributor, writing for big press outlets, whether writing about myself, writing about what I do, or even connecting with other people.
[00:40] Two years into starting the agency, I became a contributor on Forbes through a program that they have. And due to that, I've been able to become a contributor on many other platforms and been able to start my own platform, which has given me a lot of leverage from closing deals to meeting great people to getting access to really cool events.
[01:05] So, that's what we're going to be talking about today. We're going to talk about not only being a publicist, okay, but also being a publisher and lastly having your own platform if that's something that interests you. So, let's go ahead and get started.

[01:30] All right, a little bit about me. Like I mentioned, I'm a digital marketing agency owner. I focus on paid ads, SEO, and web development. And I positioned myself through PR to be able to close higher ticket clients and put myself into bigger rooms.
[01:50] I've been in the inner circle since Jeremy was in the penthouse. I think I don't know like five, six years back. I remember first mastermind I went to was like four of us sitting in his living room and then some people online.
[02:10] And Jeremy's been able to do some incredible things in the last few years. There's a bunch of us now. A lot of people in here have become millionaires. I myself have sold over $50 million in products and services using a lot of the strategies I learned in this group.

VISUAL: Métricas de sucesso, anos no Inner Circle
[02:35] And I've been able to make seven figures for myself through the agency using a lot of the strategies that I learned here. Like I said, I entered the world of PR eight years ago, two years into me having a marketing agency.
[02:55] And I've been able to expand my PR reach through three media outlets that I own and operate which give me a lot of leverage as well. So I place people in big outlets, medium-size outlets, local outlets, but then have my own as well.
[03:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "How Can I Become a Contributor?"
NÚMEROS: 8 anos de experiência em PR, 3 media outlets próprios
VISUAL: Pergunta principal em destaque, logos de outlets
[03:20] So you probably have the question, how can I become a contributor? A lot of you guys will probably benefit a lot from this for value-driven follow-up specifically if you do cold pitches. You reach out to people trying to close them whether it's through email, LinkedIn, whatever the case may be.
[03:45] Whenever I'm hitting on a topic, I usually write on these media outlets about that topic. Helps me obviously position myself a lot better. And you guys could honestly do this as well.
[04:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Three Main Contributor Programs"
NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Três programas principais listados: Forbes Agency Council, Young Entrepreneur Council, Entrepreneur Leadership Network
[04:05] There's three main ones that I want to point out. Two of which I'm a member of. Forbes Agency Council. It's pretty self-explanatory. If you own a marketing agency, if you're in the space and you meet some of their criteria, you become part of their group.
[04:25] They essentially have something that's like a LinkedIn. Okay? You're part of a group. You log in. You have a dashboard. You get to answer expert questions few times throughout the month and they pick out the best answers.
[04:45] So you usually get placed in like listicles where they talk about certain topics or you could even submit your own articles. As long as you're not overly promotional, you're able to put things out.
[05:05] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Forbes Agency Council Rules"
NÚMEROS: $2K/ano, 12 artigos/ano possíveis, 20-30 aparições/ano
VISUAL: Regras de publicação, estrutura de preços, limites de conteúdo
[05:10] Let me be very clear, these groups are not for you to become part of the group and then talk about your business. They're going to know if you're promoting. You really want to just stick to what you're a subject matter expert in and then use that to position yourself however you need to.
[05:30] They're very strict and you definitely don't want to get banned because they all know each other. Forbes Agency Council is a great one. It's extremely cheap. I think it's like two grand a year.
[05:45] And you could post up to one article a month. Think about that. 12 articles a year and then you could answer like opinion pieces. You could be coming out on Forbes fucking I don't know 20 30 times a year for 2K.
[06:05] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Forbes Contributor ROI"
NÚMEROS: $2K investimento vs. $8-10K cobrado por outros
VISUAL: Comparação de custo-benefício, diferentes tipos de contributors
[06:10] That's crazy, right? Some people are charging 8, 10,000 to get on Forbes. Now let's be very clear there's different levels of contributors on Forbes. You could be an actual staff contributor or you could be part of a paid group something like Forbes Agency Council.
[06:30] To me, it doesn't matter either way because you still rank and they give you back links to your website or to your social medias which is really really cool, right?
[06:45] Young Entrepreneur Council is another one that I've seen a lot of people use. You could definitely look into that one. And then actually the Entrepreneur Leadership Network, which is essentially the same thing, but you're publishing on Entrepreneur.
[07:05] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Entrepreneur Leadership Network"
NÚMEROS: Conteúdo duplicado em inglês e espanhol
VISUAL: Plataforma bilíngue, alcance expandido
[07:10] And something that they've been doing recently that's pretty cool is that you could publish an article in English and then they duplicate it into Spanish to their Spanish crowd. So you're reaching a whole other audience that you otherwise would have never thought about just by publishing stuff here.
[07:30] What do I publish? I publish stuff about paid ads, about SEO, about podcasting, things that are within what I do and the offers that I have. And it makes it a lot easier.
[07:50] For example, if I'm following up on LinkedIn or on text message, email with somebody that I want to book a meeting with, instead of pestering them, oh, just checking in, following up, I just send them straight value. Hey, I just dropped this on Forbes talking exactly about the issue you're having. Take a read.

NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Exemplo de follow-up usando artigos Forbes como valor
[08:20] It's pretty self-explanatory. I just fucking publish on Forbes. Okay. Same thing with entrepreneur. So, these right off the bat is stuff that you guys could do apply. You have to meet the criteria. There's certain revenue threshold. There's certain things that they ask you for.
[08:45] Entrepreneur is a little bit easier. Okay. In level of which one is easier to get in. Entrepreneur, Forbes Agency Council and I believe YEC would be the last.
[09:05] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Contributor Landing Pages"
NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Exemplos de páginas de perfil de contributor com bio customizável
[09:10] Really cool thing about it is that not only do you get to post articles and opinion pieces, but they also give you a lander. So when people Google you or they Google your name with the Forbes in it, they send you a lander that then sends them to every opinion piece you've answered and any article that you've written.
[09:35] Beautiful part about it is that you have full control over what goes in the bio. So you can make yourself look like however the fuck you want to look. Obviously you want to keep it ethical, keep it real, keep it G, but that's exactly what it is.
[09:55] They make you highlight your skills and they link to all your social media. It's pretty solid when you're introducing yourself to somebody that doesn't know you or even when they're googling you, right?
[10:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Entrepreneur Profile Example"
NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Layout de perfil: foto, bio curta, redes sociais, artigos em inglês e espanhol
[10:20] This is what it looks like on Entrepreneur. Very similar. Social medias have a short bio, picture, and then they link to absolutely everything that you ever wrote about, including the Spanish pieces.
[10:40] Now there's another way of getting published which is way harder but once you have the connections it's a lot easier to push through which is actually finding contributors or editors in chiefs for all of these outlets and building a relationship with them right?
[11:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Finding Editors & Contributors"
NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Estratégias de busca: redes sociais, LinkedIn, Twitter, Clubhouse
[11:05] How do I find them? How have I found them in the past? Social media platforms. I see who the media outlets follow. Let's say Forbes, entrepreneur or even local outlets. It doesn't always have to be Forbes and entrepreneur. There's a lot of value to local outlets because they rank on Google News as well and make you look good.
[11:30] I see who they follow. Most of the time they follow the contributors, the editors in chiefs. I go from there. I follow them, pitch them. Then when I have their name, I'll go on LinkedIn. I'll go on Twitter, etc., etc. Find them everywhere. Try to build a relationship. That's the hard part.
[11:55] But when, like I said, once you already have that relationship, it's going to be a lot easier. Twitter's a great one. Also because of the search capabilities. When you search specific roles on Instagram, you won't find it.
[12:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Clubhouse for Editor Search"
NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Clubhouse como ferramenta de busca por editores-chefe, SEO superior
[12:20] But for example, Clubhouse, you go on Clubhouse and you type in editor-in-chief and you're going to have a field day, okay? Because their SEO is fire when you're trying to search up shit like this. And not just editor-in-chief, maybe other industries you're trying to find people. So, Clubhouse has been a really good one for me.
[12:45] LinkedIn is also a great one. Editor-in-chiefs, follow them, comment, you know, DM them. Just become part of the community until eventually you're just somebody that's positioned. Especially if you're already part of these leadership networks, it's going to be a lot easier for you to get noticed by these people and then eventually be able to send them a pitch.
[13:15] One thing is you contributing, saying shit about yourself and blasting it out. And another thing is people writing about you and then having an opinion about you. They have a different impact, but they're both valuable.
[13:35] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Hunter.io for Media Contacts"
NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Chrome extension para encontrar emails de staff de publicações
[13:40] Hunter.io is another great one for like small to medium-size media publications. And Hunter is a Chrome extension, right? So, if you didn't find them on any of the ones I just mentioned, you could go on their website, run the hunter.io Chrome plugin and it'll show you like their most popular emails that have been found online for their staff members.
[14:10] And then you could just trial and error until somebody writes you back or until you figure out who's who, right? So, Hunter.io is a really great one.
[14:25] And then manually is you go on the media outlet. A lot of these media outlets, if not all of them, are broken down by category. You could just find the contributors by their articles, right? And then you just work backwards finding them on socials and then pitching them.
[14:50] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Muck Rack Platform"
NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Rede social para jornalistas, sistema de pitching, verificação automática
[14:55] Okay, so Muck Rack is another great one. A really, really solid one. Muck Rack is like a social media for contributors, for editors in chiefs. It's like a LinkedIn. Really cool thing about Muck Rack is that you could actually pitch people on there, right?
[15:20] And once you become a contributor on entrepreneur and all these other ones I've mentioned, you automatically could go on Muck Rack and sometimes they even verify you. So it's a great way of being able to connect with other people and not have to spend a lot of money.
[15:40] Everything I've showed you so far is either very cheap or no money. I'll show you other ways of being able to get access to press, which is pay-to-play. But right here, these are things that you could do that will take you some time, but once you build your database, you already know exactly who you're looking out for and who you're going to be pitching.
[16:10] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Key Components of a Great Press Release"
NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Framework de press release efetivo
[16:15] So, let's talk about the key components of a great press release, right? It's not just about reaching out to them and connecting with them. The next step is what you're telling them.
[16:35] A lot of you who run video pitches and are doing constant outreach for your agency, understand that it's not about volume. It's not just about volume, but it's about how you deliver the message and not being selfish with your message in order for them to actually be interested.
[17:00] Because we approach them, let's say, from a selfish point of view because we want to get published, but their readers don't give a fuck about us. Who are you to a million people, right?
[17:20] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Value-Packed Content Strategy"
NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Foco em valor para o leitor, não auto-promoção
[17:25] So, what you have to do is you have to make the content value packed so whoever's reading it walks away actually having learned something and then already understood that you're somebody that's an authority and gave them that piece of knowledge, those golden nuggets, right?
[17:50] So, you want to personalize each press release to each specific media outlet. I know there's you could run wires. There's websites you pay, you run wires. Those really don't ever get anywhere.
[18:10] And it's hard to get an editor-in-chief of a big magazine, big publication to want to look at some generic shit that's not even tailored to their audience. So, personalizing each press release is very important.
[18:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Press Release Best Practices"
NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Lista de práticas: personalização, objetividade, não promocional, newsworthy
[18:35] You don't want to be overly promotional or biased. You don't want to be stroking yourself or your business or your client the whole time because it just doesn't look genuine. An actual writer wouldn't really stroke you that much if they're actually trying to write about who you are.
[19:00] They would just keep it objective. They would keep it clean. They would talk about you, maybe your accomplishments, but not overly pushy. You could totally tell when some shit is fake, and you definitely don't want to do that, right?
[19:25] You want to refrain from filling the release with excessive promo content. You want to focus on being objective and informative. You want to highlight the newsworthiness of the story without self-praise or overhyping the client.
[19:50] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "What Media Wants"
NÚMEROS: Não especificados

[19:55] Something that media outlets usually want to see. They want to see what's new, right? They want to see milestones. They want to hear comeback stories. They want to hear what's new, what's hot, what's fresh. So, if you usually hit within those lines, you'll be really good.
[20:20] Something that people do with their press release is they'll write the press release and at the bottom of the press release, they'll give the editor-in-chief potential hooks that they could write within their article based off topics that you hit.
[20:40] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Hook Strategy"
NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Fornecer headlines prontas facilita aprovação
[20:45] That way, you already give them an idea of how it could look like. Makes it easier for them to do that. I myself owning three media publications could tell you that a lot of the times that people send me a pitch with great hooks, I don't have to think about the hook. They already gave it to me.
[21:10] So, it's easier for me to be like, "Oh, shit. Yeah, let's do it. Let's make it quick." Right? Because a lot of this stuff is volume, right? When you make it extremely easy for them to say yes to you, you got it in the bag because they got hundreds if not thousands of people reaching out to them every single day.
[21:35] And like I mentioned, you want to respect the audience of the publication by providing valuable and relevant information, not just stroking yourself the whole time trying to be a badass. Any questions?
[21:55] [Pergunta da audiência sobre hooks]
[22:00] It's literally like the headline. Yeah, it's literally the headline. Yeah. Anyone else? Good. All right.

[22:20] So, I wanted to show you guys a Bad Bunny press release, because it's top of industry pretty much, but it was in Spanish and I didn't want to put you guys through that if you don't speak Spanish. So, I'm going to show you one that Jay Balvin's team actually sent me a few months ago.
[22:45] That way you could see the format of how people at the top of the industry are sending the press releases and you could model after it a little bit or kind of draw a little bit of inspiration about how they're doing it.
[23:05] Here we go. I'm not going to read the whole thing. I'm just pretty much going to read the hook. Global superstar Jay Balvin returns to Coachella main stage with an out of this world performance under the desert stars.

[23:35] Okay, they talk a little bit about what happened. This one is a little bit longer. I usually try to keep them a little bit shorter. They talk about what happened about Jay Balvin. On another slide it would be about Coachella. And then they give you some example hooks, right?
[24:00] So I'm going to share these slides. You guys will be able to see how they are. And if you want another example of press releases, just let me know because I literally get blasted with about 200 a day for my media publications from top like from Amazon Prime, from Apple TV, from different outlets.
[24:25] So if they're doing it like that, there's no reason why you couldn't do it by just following their formatting. They usually attach a Google Drive link. They usually attach the images already crunched, like 100 KB. That way they don't have to worry about compressing the images.

[24:55] One great thing that you want to do when you're doing this type of stuff is you want to SEO the image already. Brandon Carter, for example, you're pitching them Brandon Carter inside the image like all the whole fucking thing. You got it ready to go. The video is also named like that. Very easy for them to just plug and play. Okay.

[25:50] Okay, you want to save a little bit of money. You could take this route, something like Press Cart. This is the only example I'm going to give you, but you could run a tool like Semrush or Uber Suggest or whatever the hell Ahrefs and find competitors that are doing the same thing.

[26:20] And it's literally what it says, press cart. You find the outlet you want, you pay for it, they get you featured. Pretty straightforward. What a lot of publicists do is they charge a retainer and then they go here, they buy that shit and then they resell to you. Okay?
[26:45] Again, I don't sell a PR service. I do this for my personal brand and for my agency. So, I'm not really here trying to pitch PR service. I want to give you guys all the tips and tricks that people are actually using in the industry to be able to get positioned.
[27:10] Now, there's a bunch more like this. What I recommend you do is you drop the link into Semrush or similar tool, find their competitors and see, you know, price match them or figure out who has the better offer.

VISUAL: Press com dofollow links = dois benefícios: exposição + SEO
[27:40] One thing I really like to do with Press, specifically Press that has do follow links, because sometimes they don't have do follow links, is you're killing two birds with one stone, if you paid for Press with a do follow link on a high domain authority website because you got Press and you got a backlink, right?
[28:10] So, a lot of people don't really think about it that way. They'll just go buy a backlink on some random site, which you could do, or you could do a little bit of both and secure yourself some press.

NÚMEROS: 7 dias turnaround típico
VISUAL: Checklist: indexa no Google News, domain authority, turnaround time, disclosure de sponsored
[28:35] A few things you guys want to be aware of when buying press is indexability. Does it index on Google News? Those are the ones I like to go for. When people Google your name or the name of your business on the news tab, it comes out.
[29:00] A lot of press has high domain authority, but they don't rank on Google News. You could do a little bit of both, but you definitely want to look out for that. Turnaround times are also very important. A lot of these platforms will tell you it indexes on Google News. 7-day turnaround time.
[29:25] And another thing that they actually do is some of them have to disclose that you paid for it. So it'll say like sponsored post or whatever. Some of them don't. Some of them are compliant, some are not. Up to you what you want to do. But that's a little bit about that.

[29:55] Let's talk about earned media versus paid media. I showed you how to pay for it on Press Cart. I showed you how to earn it by reaching out to editors in chiefs and potential contributors.
[30:15] Earned media, it's organic, non-paid efforts. Builds credibility and trustworthiness. It could be achieved via pitching stories and media relations to the people that we mentioned and it has no direct cost but it does require time for you to build that database and build the relationships with these people that I mentioned.

NÚMEROS: Alguns dias vs. semanas/meses
VISUAL: Características: controle sobre mensagem, alcance imediato, custo financeiro
[30:50] Paid media is something like press cart. Okay. And it's paid promotional efforts. You have control over the messaging and the placement because you're paying for it. You know you could really ride the line there on what you could do because it's not earned media.
[31:15] When it's earned media, the editor-in-chief is writing about you. You can't push them to make you look like a freaking rock star because maybe they don't want to do that. They want to be more objective. On paid media, it's a little bit easier to get away with stuff like that.
[31:40] You have immediate wide reach with paid media. Like some of these platforms, you could be up within a few days versus, you know, maybe a few weeks or months of building these relationships. And of course, paid media requires a financial investment.
[32:05] You could get and for both of these, you could get newspaper articles, TV segments, blog posts, social media mentions, and a lot more stuff. Questions about this?
[32:25] [Pergunta sobre Press Cart]
[32:30] Yeah. I mean, it's just it's just quicker and costs money, you know, and some of them tend to be a little bit expensive. The thing is that most people usually go for Forbes Entrepreneur that like that's what they want, but you don't necessarily need that.

[33:00] There's a bunch of other outlets that feature on Google News, have really high domain authority, and they're going to get you there. Most people really just want to check off the Forbes at least one or two times. You could get that out of the way. It'll cost a few G's, and then you just move on to something else.
[33:25] [Pergunta sobre melhores outlets no Press Cart]
[33:30] There's specifically some that I'm actually a contributor on. There's Grid Daily News. There's um I can't I'm drawing blanks right now, but I could share more after.
[33:50] To be quite honest with you, I don't use Press Cart a lot. I don't like to. I like to do it based off relationships that I build. And given that I own media outlets, it's easier for me to reach out to people that reach out to me to do a favor and then like it's an exchange of shit.

[34:20] I've probably paid for press like two or three times in the last 10 years. So, I wouldn't be able to tell you exactly which ones are the top ones. So, the development of my PR journey, I started off with Forbes Agency Council.
[34:45] Funny story, actually. Two years into starting my marketing agency, I had done some really cool projects with some really cool local and international brands and I got a lot of people's attention. I was also on TV. I was doing keynote speeches.
[35:10] And I get an email from an organization claiming that they work through Forbes. They are Forbes. I thought it was a scam and told them to fuck off. Two weeks later I'm like, "Let me look into that a little bit deeper." Something told me I needed to go back. It turns out it was actually Forbes.

[36:00] Later on, I said, you know what? I want to be able to have more reach in other platforms. So, I reached out to Grit Daily News, which has a ton of reach. Became a contributor on that. At that time, Gary Vaynerchuk was popping off. I'm sure you guys know Gary Vee. And I became a contributor on his platform. 1:37 p.m. started talking about marketing shit, branding shit, shit like that.

[36:35] And few years after that, I believe it was at the beach house with Jeremy, he told us to read propaganda. Have you guys read Propaganda? Anybody here? Yeah. Okay.
[36:55] So, propaganda is pretty much a book that shows you how the public perception is manipulated through media, influencers in general, how media outlets could make you think certain things or make you think certain things are popular and shift your perspective on stuff and the power behind that to be able to create demand for products, demand for services, to make you look a certain way.
[37:30] So, I read the book and after reading the book, I realized that not only did I want to contribute because it was important, but I wanted to have my own media outlet because I would have more control and I would have more power, be able to get a lot more reach in certain areas that I otherwise wouldn't be able to because I would be tied to the rules that the other outlets are giving me.

[38:05] If I own my own outlet, I make my own rules, right? So, at the time I created a podcast called The Hustle Inspires Hustle that runs to this day. Jeremy's been a guest. We've had Andy Frisella. He was the first guest. Grant Cardone, Chris Voss, Neil Patel, Randi Zuckerberg, Gil Dezer, who's built all the towers for Donald Trump, and a bunch of other people. We have about 135 episodes right now.
[38:40] And this specific outlet has been able to make me a ton of money at my agency because a lot of the people that I interview end up seeing that I'm a marketer. I end up doing business with them or they end up recommending me to somebody. So that's one media outlet.

[39:10] Few years after that, about two and a half years ago, I decided that I didn't just want to focus on business content and marketing content, but I wanted to break into the world of entertainment. Why? Because in the world of entertainment is where all the ballers are at.
[39:35] So I decided to create a publication called Fame. Fame is a magazine that's fully digital. We do articles, interviews, and we do digital covers. These aren't printed, but we actually do the covers with these artists.

[40:25] Artists actually share the covers. We create the content with them. We put it out on the internet and helps us further build the brand. Through that, I was able to reach my objective.

[40:50] Through owning a media outlet, I've been able to get in the room with executives from all of these brands, either gotten paid from these brands, built collaborative partnership with these brands, or actually created events with these brands.
[41:15] We've been able to do everything from red carpet coverage, interviewing executives, events, interviews, whether they're in person or on Zoom, and we share them on the actual website and on the social media platforms.

[41:45] So, the power of PR. Why is this important? First and foremost, for me, it's power. Okay, there's a whole different feeling when people need you to help them, right? You're not asking them for anything. You own a media publication that's powerful and they owe you a million favors. Okay.
[42:15] Positioning for yourself, for your brands, for your friends brands, for your clients brands. Very important. Building connections, like I mentioned, authority hijacking, jacking up your personal brand, like I mentioned, value-driven follow-up. It's great for that.
[42:40] And getting invited to events you otherwise wouldn't get invited to. There's a lot of events that a lot of people want to get into, and no matter how much money you want to spend, you cannot get into those rooms. And the only way to get into those rooms, into those red carpets, is by having a media outlet. Okay.

VISUAL: Estratégia: criar conteúdo pessoal + conteúdo do outlet = acesso
[44:10] Now, how do I get into these events? Very simple. Content creation is a hell of a thing. If you have a strong personal brand, makes it easier for you to get invited to these events. And the whole point of going to these events is not just to take a picture and flex, but it's to talk to the people who are running it.
[44:40] Building connections, building relationships that will later on help you out to do whatever it is that your objective is, right? So very important you create content for your personal brand, but also if you have a media outlet while on site, you could have a videographer.
[45:05] A lot of you guys walk around, travel around with videographers, people creating content for you. It doesn't take much extra effort to pull up to one of these events, create content for yourself, and also create content for your media outlet.
[45:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Content Repurposing Strategy"

[45:35] You could then repurpose the content, share it, and all of these executives, TV networks, TV channels, all of their social media accounts will always share it.
[45:55] Now, you'll probably tell me, Alex, but if I start a new outlet, it's not Forbes, it's not entrepreneur. Why would the hell would somebody want to share something on a small outlet?
[46:15] Publicists and people in the media world are not going to look down upon a small outlet because there's a limited amount of outlets that do good work. There's a limited amount of outlets that do good work and have solid people behind them.
[46:40] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Small Outlet Advantage"
NÚMEROS: 30-60 views ainda são valiosas
VISUAL: Relacionamentos > tamanho do outlet
[46:45] So, it's all a matter about relationships. There's bigger outlets, yeah, but they pay just as much attention to the small outlets, even if it has 30, 40, 50, 60 views.
[47:05] One of the things that I did with my outlets when I started out is a lot of people try to start an outlet and try to get rich off of it. My outlets cost me money a lot of the time. I either break even, I end up having to put money for the outlets.
[47:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Outlet ROI Philosophy"

[47:35] But when I quantify how much money I'm making indirectly, it makes total sense for me to do it. When I quantify how I build my personal brand, how I get power out of it, it makes total sense to be able to do it.
[48:00] So I knock out two birds with one stone. I position my personal brand. I already have camera people on site, create content for the platform. After I create the content, we do a video. We do an article write up. And then immediately after that's done, you share it with all the top heads and executives of whatever niche you're in.
[48:30] Whether you're in real estate, whether you're in medical, whether you're in fitness, whatever the case may be. I have an entertainment publication, but you don't have to have an entertainment publication. You could always niche down.

Trademark is very important. You probably want to do a trademark check with a trademark attorney. Make sure you're solid.
[49:20] Create the name. Know you're good. You want to choose a topic or niche, whatever you want to call it. And you're going to need a virtual assistant using AI, Chat GPT, Claude, whatever the hell you want to use.
[49:40] And you want to build a relationship with PR firms and publicists because you're probably going to ask me, well, what the hell am I going to write about? You don't have to worry about that. Okay? Why?

[50:05] Because the same way we reach out to these people with how I mentioned earlier on, what you're going to do is once you have a name, a topic, you have your lander built out, you have the actual website built out, you're going to create a deck, a PDF, shows your demographics.
[50:30] If you don't have a lot of reach, do some posts on your social media. Run ads with the post, get a little bit of reach on the post, make it look like it has a little bit of traffic, do shout outs, whatever you need to do at first.
[50:55] You reach out to the PR firms and PR firms are salivating for new media outlets because what happens with them is their clients pay them a retainer and sometimes those retainers are three, four, five, 10, 20, 30K a month.

[51:25] And they're supposed to deliver a certain amount of publications with their name or their business on it whether it's TV, whether it's podcast, whatever the case may be. So, they're always looking for new outlets.
[51:45] It's as easy as literally pitching them the same way we cold pitch people for our agencies. Hey, I have a media outlet. We talk about this, we talk about that. I'm not trying to sell you anything. All I want you to do is whenever you send out a press release, send it to my email.
[52:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Content Creation Workflow"
NÚMEROS: Dias, não meses, para começar a receber conteúdo
VISUAL: VA filtra emails → escolhe relevantes → ChatGPT + editor → publica → envia link → PR firma compartilha
[52:20] So, what you do now is your VA is looking at this email, sifting through everything, and you could use a VA and yourself or a VA and an editor-in-chief, and you choose the ones that are relevant to your brand, to what you want to write about.
[52:45] You could literally have 20 to 30 PR firms sending you press releases within two weeks. Immediately you have a connection with the PR company. Whether it's a PR company or it's just a solo publicist. Both work just fine.
[53:10] So this is not going to take months or years. It's actually days where you're actually start receiving info. The great thing about it is once they email you and you put a publication up, copy and paste into Chat GPT, you're definitely going to want to have a solid prompt so you have brand voice and whatever the case may be.

We already did a partnership with Buchanan's, with Ciroc, with Old Parr where they're sending us products or we're getting paid to create content with them on our magazine just because we reached out and we created solid content.
[55:10] So, a lot of us are used to building websites. We know a little bit about SEO. We know about content creation. If we just find a way to automate that same way you're automating a lot of your stuff, we'll be able to actually have a press outlet up and running for a few G's a month.

The things that you're able to accomplish are absolutely wild by just having a little outlet.
[56:15] You don't have to worry about print. You don't have to worry about doing all these other extra stuff. This thing could run on autopilot for you and make you a ton of money or build some great connections for you. So, let's keep it moving.

[57:00] Be surprised. Just email an event. Hey, I am this media outlet. We want to come and cover. We're going to write an article about you. They will roll out the red carpet for you. They will send you VIP passes. You will get skybox suites. You'll get tickets.
[57:25] [Pergunta sobre aplicar a podcasts]
[57:30] This also applies to a podcast, right? Yes. Yes, it does. Absolutely.
[57:40] Another thing is you want to sign up for Google News. Okay. It's taken years for people, especially after 2020, it became really hard for media outlets to get on the Google News tab because of all the craziness going on with COVID.

So, your outlet could actually show up on the Google News app and have its own like profile. That's definitely something that you want to look into.
[58:35] You could do written articles or you could do Zoom interviews. Okay, Zoom interviews. If you don't want to interview anybody, you could just literally book somebody, they jump on Zoom, you ask them the questions, you don't have to come out on the interview.

[59:30] Website design, you guys know about that. On the techy nerdy side, you want to have a Google search console, Google Analytics for obvious reasons. You want to backlink as well for building your domain authority. Creating social media content. We talked about that.
[59:55] Hire a social media manager. Pretty easy. Once the content is created, have them post it out. You could create like fucking 50 reels off one 10-minute interview.
[60:10] [Pergunta sobre ferramenta de AI para edição]
[60:15] Oh, no. My brother does that. He runs all the photo video content and he chops every interview out. So you could choose out like for example right now we're doing two reels per interview but you could pull out a ton of reels per interview.

[61:10] You need a good website, SEO that thing, pump out a lot of content, within a few months, you'll have like thousands of visitors on the site and then, you know, it'll start speaking for itself.
[61:30] Hire video editor. Your probably your most expensive is going to be the video editor part. Okay. But a lot of you guys know what a video editor costs. You guys create content all the time, so you pretty much already know what that's like. Yep. And that's pretty much it. Any questions?
[61:55] [Pergunta sobre publicação = website]

So, what you could do is when they have a press junket, you could send the questions in and they'll have the artist answer it on camera and they'll send you the content.
[64:05] Fuck, you don't have to hire cameras. You don't have to worry about paying for the artist's travel. None of that shit. You literally Luis Fonsi's recorded... He's the guy that did Despacito. You know that Despacito song? That's that guy.

[65:55] And then back to the covers. You had questions about the covers. They're digital covers. So what we do with the covers is the following. We have this static cover like this. So it looks like a regular magazine cover.

[66:25] But then we do give you an example. This one is with Rehab. So we do a static cover at the top. We have ads. We do the write up. And then we turn the static cover into pretty much like a moving image.
[66:50] And then that gets a ton of reach because we do shared posts with the artist. Our covers are getting anywhere from 500,000 to a million reach each. So the artists are actually doing the marketing for us. An artist comes out on a magazine whether it's a digital cover or not, they want to share it. So they're do I don't we have zero ad spend? Zero.
[67:20] [Pergunta sobre artistas entrarem em contato]
[67:25] How about that? So the artist reach out to you or you like at first if you like do it yourself and then publicists will pitch you. Yeah. At first, like when this was brand new, did you pitch them? I pitched a few publicists. Yeah.
[67:50] [Pergunta sobre métricas do site]
[67:55] And then like when you're reaching out to different people, do you have to say how many hits your site gets like especially if it's brand new? Absolutely. Yeah.

[68:15] At first I started with social media. So I pumped up the social media numbers, got shout outs, had a certain amount of reach per month and they started, you know, interacting.
[68:35] And then once we started hitting search console and started ranking really well on Google, we actually showed them their numbers. You could get 5,000, 10,000, 20,000 hits a month. They're going to pay attention to you. You don't need 100K or anything like that.
[69:00] Again, a media outlet is a media outlet. They come in different sizes and they understand that. They're not going to discriminate because you're not Forbes or something like that.
[69:20] [Pergunta sobre intenção de monetização]
[69:25] You had a question. Did I answer it? I have another question here. So what's your intent just in terms of like monetization simply grow your name out there inside magazine or publication or what type of strategy?

NÚMEROS: 20-30K leitores/mês
VISUAL: Formas de monetização: ads, eventos (200-400 pessoas), advertorials, parcerias de marca
[69:50] There's a few ways I'm monetizing it and to be clear my intention isn't necessarily to monetize it but to position myself and get in the right rooms. It just so happens that as it's grown I've been able to monetize it in a few ways and I'll explain them now.
[70:15] One of the ways is ads. Sometimes I have my own ads or I have advertisers that pay me to be on here. We have a readership of about 20 to 30,000 readers a month and they engage. So we drive a significant amount of clicks.
[70:40] We have alcohol brands, we have clothing brands, we have different brands that pay us. And again, we don't have a ton of reach. So what you charge has to be relative to what you give them. But that's one way of monetizing.
[71:05] Another way of monetizing is doing events locally. We do events that fill up rooms of anywhere from 200 to 400 people locally. So we kind of license our name out. We have a pretty brandable name. It's called Fame.
[71:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Fame Brand Licensing"
NÚMEROS: Eventos de 200-400 pessoas
VISUAL: Licenciamento do nome "Fame" para eventos, apelo ao ego
[71:35] Everybody wants their name next to something that says fame for many purposes, specifically ego. So they want the brand to be present. We monetize in that way. We have advertorials that we sell. And there's few other ways of being able to monetize from that.
[72:00] But the biggest takeaway I want you guys to take away from this is not necessarily like do something like this to get paid off of it is just do something like this to get access.
[72:20] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Key Takeaway: Access > Money"

[72:25] Whether it's entertainment, whether it's chiropractors, whether it's doctors, whatever the case may be, you don't have to have a massive publication, but whatever niche you're crushing it in right now, it's very easy to start a media outlet around that. Everybody wants to be featured.
[72:50] So yeah, any other questions? Good. Cool. Appreciate y'all. Thank you.
