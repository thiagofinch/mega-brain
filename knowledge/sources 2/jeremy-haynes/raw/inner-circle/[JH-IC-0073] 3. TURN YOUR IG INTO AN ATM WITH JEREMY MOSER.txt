In 2023, having an audience or a personal brand is probably building your own federal reserve.   [01:43]  And the reason for that is because there's been a little shift, right? We all know attention. It's the newest currency and all that stuff.   [01:51]  But now what people do even more is because there's so much online they kind of start to look up to, you know, a different set of people that they're like, I want to be like them or, you know, I want to basically just be that person.   [02:04]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "People Look Up To"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Fotos de influenciadores e personalidades, layout em grade, exemplos de pessoas aspiracionais   [02:06]  And, you know, these are some of the people that people in today's area all look up to.

[02:34]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "3 Things You Need: KNOW → LIKE → TRUST"   NÚMEROS:  3 elementos   VISUAL:  Funil progressivo, setas conectando os três estágios, design de fluxo   [02:36]  Now, what you actually need to have a personal brand that has a strong enough message where you basically get people to do whatever you want them to do, right? Comes down to three things.   [02:47]  Having stuff out there that gets people to know you, aka who you are, what you're about, and kind of what your core message is.   [02:54]  Whether they go and like you. So actually you say stuff that resonates with you that you think oh that's actually pretty cool and that you want to be just like them.   [03:03]  And trust aka oh they're actually not just full of shit like a lot of marketers out there and they actually you know going to fulfill on the promise that you're going to give you.   [03:13]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Why Instagram?"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Logo do Instagram, conceito de reality TV show, elementos de comunidade e tempo real   [03:15]  So what other platform better than Instagram? It's kind of like a reality TV show, right? You know you have in real time you see what they're up to on a day-to-day basis.   [03:24]  You also get to go and see what they're doing, the lessons they're learning as they're posting on their feed.   [03:29]  And all in all, you kind of create this community aspect through DMs and all that other stuff where really you can attract, nurture, and convert people at scale every single day.   [03:40]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "What Makes a Million Dollar Personal Brand"   NÚMEROS:  $1M/mês mencionado   VISUAL:  Três pilares, design de estrutura, elementos de marca pessoal   [03:43]  So the question we're going to be covering here today is what really makes or breaks and how can you create a million dollar a month personal brand.   [03:52]  Now it's really three things. It's number one having a story that's somewhat relatable or compelling.   [03:59]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Pillar #1: STORY (Relatable/Compelling)"   NÚMEROS:  9-to-5 mencionado   VISUAL:  Exemplo de conteúdo do Paul, história de transformação, layout de post do Instagram   [04:01]  Now this is an example of content we made for Paul and it's really about his story summarized and it's kind of relatable to people that go and work a 9 to 5.   [04:10]  It's really something that they can identify with and they're like, "hm, okay, I have a similar story in somewhat of capacity. I can see myself within this guy."   [04:19]  Or they're like, "Oh, that's an outcome that I've achieved familiar. Maybe someone else was homeless and can relate to that or they've just been on the brink of it and they want to be just like that."   [04:30]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Pillar #2: EXPERTISE & AUTHORITY"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Elementos de credibilidade, provas de resultados, posicionamento de expert   [04:32]  And number two, you need to go and have some form of expertise and authority, right? If you don't show that you've actually made money or you've done the thing that you're talking about, why would anyone listen? Doesn't really matter, does it?   [04:45]  And so having that authority is really important to go and actually manifest or like kind of nurture people into, you know, believing what you tell them.   [04:55]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Pillar #3: PERSONALITY"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Comparação entre pessoa corporativa chata vs pessoa engraçada e autêntica   [04:57]  And last is personality. If you go and book a call with two different guys and one of them is just this like hyper corporate like boring ass person, you might actually pick the other guy who's kind of funny who's going to crack a joke with you and is who's really going to be like, "Oh, hey, this guy actually has some form of substance that I can go connect with."   [05:18]  Okay, so that's really the key pillars, I would say, of a personal brand.   [05:23]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "The Trojan Horse Traffic Source"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Conceito de cavalo de Troia, fonte de tráfego secreta, design misterioso   [05:25]  Now, I'll get into the traffic component, how we actually grow and explode personal brands. And it's what I call the Trojan horse traffic source.   [05:33]  Now, I know a lot of you run Facebook ads or like Google ads, and traditionally, you pay for every interaction with an elite until you either collect an email address or a phone number, you harass the living shit out of them, until they either spam you, block you, or cost you out through an email, right?   [05:51]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Imagine This..."   NÚMEROS:  Centenas ou milhares de emails por dia, 7-20x visualizações diárias   VISUAL:  Conceito de coletar emails massivamente, remarketing intensivo com gratidão   [05:53]  So, as a marketer, imagine you could collect hundreds or thousands of emails every single day. Advertise to them seven, 10, 15, 20 times every single day and they actually thank you for it rather than insult you. That'd be pretty cool, right?   [06:09]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Welcome to Instagram Shoutouts"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Logo ou conceito de shoutouts do Instagram, explicação visual do sistema   [06:11]  So, welcome to the world of Instagram shoutouts. That's really what we go and do.   [06:16]  I'm sure you've seen or you follow pages just like these ones.   [06:20]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Instagram Feed Example"   NÚMEROS:  2 posts destacados como diferentes   VISUAL:  Feed do Instagram com posts curados, dois posts de shoutout se destacando visualmente   [06:22]  And so, when I show you a screenshot of this feed, I want you to look at something. Do you notice how like most of these pieces of content are like very curated and have like a clear branded look, but then two of them, they kind of stand out.   [06:36]  And as you can see, Paul's freaking everywhere in this presentation.   [06:40]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "What Are Shoutouts?"   NÚMEROS:  $50 por shoutout mencionado   VISUAL:  Explicação visual de como shoutouts funcionam, posts destacados em feeds de grandes páginas   [06:42]  Basically, the difference is that these pages that stand out, they're what we call shoutouts. So, basically, what you do is you pay for distribution of your organic content to get seen on these big pages.   [06:55]  Naturally, all these business entrepreneurship pages or even in the health, wealth, and fitness space, they all have a ton of followers that are targeted and qualified around what you want to go and do, right? Whether it's get business clients or whether you want to get fitness clients.   [07:10]  And what you do is you have an organic piece of content that shows your story, your transformation or whatever. And you kind of funnel them into your own world.   [07:19]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Underpriced Attention"   NÚMEROS:  $50 por shoutout, 100 seguidores, $2,000 curso, 40x ROAS   VISUAL:  Cálculo de ROI, comparação de custos, exemplo de precificação   [07:21]  And it's really underpriced attention because most of these guys, oh god, because most of these guys, they don't understand business. They'll go and charge you $50 for a single shout out creative because they're like, "Hey, that's great money if I sell 30 of those like 15 a month."   [07:37]  And they live out in India because that's where most of these pages like kind of started off. They don't understand that like for us as marketers, if we going to acquire, you know, 100 followers off of that and one of them converts, we're selling a $2,000 course, that's a pretty solid ROAS for $50, 2,000, like a 40x ROAS.   [07:58]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Distribution System Flow"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Fluxo: conteúdo orgânico → distribuição em páginas de shoutout → cliques → seguir → mais conteúdo → conversão   [08:00]  And so really, the whole distribution system works the following. You have your organic piece of content, which like the bottom left image, you go pay for and distribute it across these shoutout pages, and then obviously they go and click on the person that's advertised, right? In this case, would be the bottom right guy.   [08:18]  They go and follow him and then this guy's job is to just post more content which then either one nurtures, converts and like kind of you know builds a relationship with the audience which then again those pieces of content can be used to freaking run more traffic.   [08:34]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Conversion Metrics"   NÚMEROS:  $50-$800 por shoutout, $0.02-$0.80 custo por seguidor, $10K-$40K por 1,000 seguidores, 10x ROI   VISUAL:  Tabela de métricas, custos variáveis, retornos esperados, breakdown financeiro   [08:36]  And in reality here's kind of how the conversion standpoint looks like based on the page which is based on followers and reach that they get. We're going to go spend anywhere from 50 all the way up to $800 for a single shout out.   [08:50]  Off of that, we on average get between two cents all the way up to 80 cents average over the month in terms of cost per follower.   [09:00]  And so what we do is our metric is out of 1,000 followers, we'll go and take out anywhere from 10k all the way up on the higher end 40k - $40,000 in sales.   [09:12]  So basically we're kind of factoring in if you spend $1,000 to acquire 1,000 followers and we go take 10,000 follow $10,000 out of that it's pretty much a 10x. That's a bit on the lower end.   [09:23]  Go ahead.   [09:24]  [PERGUNTA DA AUDIÊNCIA] What is the general ratio like for what you pay you should pay for depending on follow count and reach.   [09:31]  So it really depends on the ad creative which I'll go cover in a second. But realistically I would say if you start out you probably go and aim for a dollar. So $1 follower but you want to go get that as low as possible.   [09:44]  So hence for us the average ratio right now is about for $100 you should get anywhere from like for for for $1 you should get anywhere from like five to 10 followers out of it. That's really kind of the goal.   [09:57]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Monthly Spend Range"   NÚMEROS:  $3,000-$20,000 por mês por cliente   VISUAL:  Range de investimento, escalabilidade do sistema   [09:59]  And then for us, we go and spend anywhere from $3,000 to $20,000 per month for a single client.   [10:06]  Now, for you guys, when you guys run Facebook ads, right, you kind of just when an ad converts, you just spend more on it. And that's kind of how you scale up your conversions, even though the ROI goes down.   [10:17]  Well, shout outs is different. You got to go learn how you can maximize your existing spend. So, basically, your average number of followers per dollar that you spend. And then you can kind of run it up.   [10:29]  We've had clients that tried to go and spend $50,000 because they're like, "Oh, whoever spends more is going to make the most." But that really turned to shit because then everyone resented them. Their cost per follower went up like crazy and they couldn't really scale.   [10:42]  So that's where the shout outs in of itself, they're great because you don't need the highest budget to get into it and actually like convert people at scale. But on the downside, you can't go and just pump more money into it and make a shit ton more.   [10:56]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "What Creatives Actually Convert"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Categorias de criativos, exemplos visuais de diferentes tipos de conteúdo   [10:58]  But I want to show you guys some of the creatives because I think that's something that's never really covered whether that's Facebook ads or anything else is what creatives actually convert.   [11:07]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Creative Type #1: TRANSFORMATIONS"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Antes e depois, storytelling visual, copy envolvente   [11:09]  So just like traditionally it's transformations, right? Obviously kind of telling a story which is enticing with a clickbaity hook and then kind of fulfilling on that through visual images in real formats or just compelling copy whether it's like through text-based content.   [11:27]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Creative Type #2: EXPERTISE AUTHORITY"   NÚMEROS:  0-100K seguidores em 3 meses   VISUAL:  Exemplo de ex-banker de investimento, posicionamento de expert, crescimento rápido   [11:29]  The second thing is expertise authority. Now, this particular person was someone we recently launched and he had the fastest growth I've ever seen. He's a former investment banker.   [11:39]  We pretty much went like, "Hey, look, we'll go and position him as an expert. We'll trigger everyone by obviously referencing the bank, which everyone seems super upset about."   [11:48]  That client went pretty much zero to 100,000 followers within like the span of 3 months.   [11:54]  Now, their sales team was absolute dog shit because they had a bunch of fat cat closers. So, the conversions were pretty poor. But, he's on track to do some serious numbers right now.   [12:04]  And again, that's the beauty of it. Because we acquired the followers, we're literally able to retarget and remarket to them every single day over a dozen times.   [12:14]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Creative Type #3: EXPERTISE BASED"   NÚMEROS:  $33M em comissões mencionado   VISUAL:  Prova de resultados massivos, autoridade através de números   [12:16]  The last part is expertise based, right? If you go and see someone talking about like, oh, you should get into sales because it's like an amazing opportunity. That's cool.   [12:25]  But if somebody shows you, hey, I've made over 33 million in commissions and here's how I did it. It's just going to be naturally more sticky and more tacky to what you want to go and do. And therefore, they'll be very actively following you.   [12:40]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "What Makes a Good Ad"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Checklist de elementos: específico, call out audiência, valor/outcome, apelo viral   [12:42]  Now, as a summary, what actually makes a good ad? Now, it's just like with Facebook ads, I guess specific, calls out the target audience, provides value and some form of outcome, but it has that viral appeal.   [12:56]  With Facebook ad, it doesn't really matter, I guess, but with shoutouts, you got to have that viral appeal where like even the normal average person is going to look at it, gain some form of value out of it, and engage with it.   [13:08]  Because the more people engage with your content, the more reach it gets, which means it reaches more of your ideal audience for free pretty much. And you kind of can maximize the amount of traction you gain out of a single shout out.   [13:21]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "What Most People Get Wrong"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Alerta de erro comum, shoutouts como truque vs estratégia real   [13:23]  But here's what most people get wrong. We get so many people hitting me up, hey man, I want to do IG shoutouts, IG shoutouts here and there. It's just a party trick.   [13:32]  At the end of the day, all it is is content amplification, which is leading us into the $20 million content matrix.   [13:40]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "The $20M Content Matrix"   NÚMEROS:  $20 milhões   VISUAL:  Framework de conteúdo, sistema completo, estrutura de matriz   [13:42]  All you need to do to really go make shoutouts as per se work for you is have really good content which comes from, you know, being really good at short form or really good like text-based written copy.   [13:54]  And I'm going to break down to you guys the three pieces of content that we have right now.   [13:59]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Content Type #1: REELS"   NÚMEROS:  1M+ alcance mencionado   VISUAL:  Ícone de Reels, vídeo curto, elementos de viralização   [14:01]  So it's number one, reels. Naturally, short form content is king right now, right? High organic reach even on Instagram, although nobody really admits it. Has high potential to go viral. We've had multiple videos get well over a million in reach.   [14:17]  And it really connects with the audience because think of it, you're like scrolling in your lunch break and you have like, you know, this 18-year-old or like 20-year-old freaking shouting at you and like how you know his mom woke up at 5:30 every day and now he's like a multi-millionaire. It's going to connect with you to some degree, right? If it's done right.   [14:36]  And so that's really why short form is super powerful.   [14:40]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Content Type #2: THREADS (Carousels)"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Posts de carrossel, múltiplos slides, formato de thread   [14:42]  I want to go mix that in with threads. Those are like basically your carousel posts, which are basically like an assembly of tweets that you put together.   [14:51]  And what they do is they're really great at telling stories, catching people's attention, and kind of, you know, taking it from there, nurturing people, and ultimately actually converting.   [15:01]  I'm gonna cover this later because regardless whether you use this strategy or you just have clients that have or an organic feed, this is one thing that really can go and get you a crap ton of sales.   [15:12]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Content Type #3: TWEETS"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Formato de tweet, posts curtos, opiniões e breakdowns   [15:14]  And lastly, we have tweets. Basically, this is great for breakdown, but also really for opinion expressing. Obviously, we've seen this with like guys like Tate that have done really well with the whole expressing opinions aspect.   [15:27]  And realistically for you, that's a great way to either just like shitpost as they call it on Twitter or just like actually drop numerical breakdowns or thoughts and really resonate with your target audience.   [15:39]  Does that make sense so far?   [15:41]  Sweet.   [15:43]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "7-Day Content Calendar"   NÚMEROS:  7 dias   VISUAL:  Calendário semanal, estrutura de postagem diária   [15:45]  All right, you guys ready to go and get a breakdown of how this gentleman here is making over a million a month off of Instagram alone?   [15:52]  All right, so to start out with, we started with him about a year and 3 months ago.   [15:58]  So, who would like our internal 7-day basically content calendar?   [16:03]  All right, let's do it.   [16:05]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "DAY 1: REELS - Transformation Content"   NÚMEROS:  7,000 likes, 1,000 seguidores ganhos   VISUAL:  Exemplo de reel de transformação, antes/depois, métricas de engajamento   [16:07]  So, first up, we kind of start with reals. Obviously, short form is king. So, we kind of want to go into that. And the best type of content that we've seen across the board is transformational content.   [16:18]  It kind of started with the whole gym space where people drop these corny like I was fat now I'm skinny or I was super skinny now I'm shredded content.   [16:27]  And really in the business space it kind of works the same. Here we had a client of ours. He was kind of introverted a bit overweight I guess.   [16:35]  And we took this whole transformation of him going from overweight poor into like dropping out of school and then getting into setting and making some money into a whole transformation real.   [16:46]  And clearly this type of stuff really works because that was one of his first pieces of content. Got like 7,000 likes organically and pretty much gained like a thousand followers.   [16:56]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "DAY 2: TWEET - Opinion/Value"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Exemplos de tweets, opinião vs conselho financeiro   [16:58]  Now number two, you want to go and hammer out a tweet. It's just something like expressing an opinion. Whether that be that like, hey, if you invest your money, you're an idiot or like if you charge by the hour, you shouldn't be doing that.   [17:10]  Just kind of something that actually gets people thinking or just provides a quick spur of like, oh, that was super valuable.   [17:17]  And here's some examples for that. Obviously, as you can see, the first one is more like generic financial advice, and the one on the right is more like personal, right?   [17:26]  Where you kind of call people out that make disadvantages and excuse, and you kind of get them thinking, and they're like, "Oh, that was actually a good piece of advice. I really like that."   [17:36]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "DAY 3: TUTORIAL/FAQ - Misconceptions"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Exemplo de tutorial sobre carro, McLaren e G Wagon mencionados   [17:38]  So on day three, what you kind of want to go and do is you want to do a tutorial or a frequently asked question around, you know, either something that people ask you a lot or a misconception.   [17:49]  Because when you have a misconception, it kind of shocks people and it's very known on TikTok, but usually people get very upset and they'll just go either hate on you, they go and like leave really mean comments or whatever.   [18:01]  So this is a great example off of it. Pretty much we were like Paul bought a new car. We were like, "Hey, how can we go and turn this into content?"   [18:08]  So, pretty much whipped up how you can afford your dream car for free using ATMs or Bitcoin ATMs.   [18:15]  And obviously inside of the video, we obviously flex that he has a McLaren and a like a G Wagon and kind of do the breakdowns.   [18:22]  And it really entails for people if they want to have a car like that, oh, if I set up X amount of ATMs, I can actually go and drive a great car.   [18:30]  And obviously, if the people say you cannot do ATMs, they're just going to get blown up. This is so bad. But obviously, but that's great because even if they're hating, it gives us more engagement, which means it pushes it deeper into the algorithm.   [18:43]  And all it does, it gives us more of the actual right eyeballs which are going to do what we want to do, which is engage, follow, hit us up in the DMs, and buy his stuff.   [18:52]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "DAY 4: THREAD - Story/Tutorial"   NÚMEROS:  100-300-1,000 DMs dependendo do post   VISUAL:  Exemplos de carrossel, stories de origem, CTAs no final   [18:54]  So lastly, there's a thread at day four. This is really key, especially if you have clients that have an organic audience and do stuff like webinars or just general like book a call funnel.   [19:06]  At this part, you want to go either tell a story, whether it's your origin story, whether it's like just a funny story that has a valuable outcome, or you want to do like a frequently asked questions, handle an objection, or just go through a tutorial.   [19:20]  And so, these are just two great examples. They're both obviously using the couple angle, but it's pretty much telling a story, delivering an outcome, and then being like, "Hey, here's how we actually gotten to that point."   [19:32]  Which for a lot of people on Instagram spikes the interest of swiping through it. And then at the end, there's a little call to action to either follow them or hey, drop me a DM, drop me a message, hit the link in the bio, and let's get this rolling.   [19:46]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "DAY 5: REEL - Numbers/Breakdown"   NÚMEROS:  $10K/mês mencionado como exemplo   VISUAL:  Exemplos de Airbnb, breakdowns numéricos, provas de resultados   [19:48]  So, day five, we're back to rolling real content just with a breakdown. One thing that I've noticed is people love numbers.   [19:56]  If you can show people, here's how you can make 10K a month. Here's how I made X amount doing this crazy thing, people eat that up because it's easy, it's attainable, and it really gets them to the point where they're like, oh, I can go do this, too. Let's get it started.   [20:10]  These are just some of the examples that we've made in the Airbnb space specifically. Which they absolutely printed because people either go and say, "That's cap. You're a scammer. You don't know what you're talking about."   [20:21]  Or you're like, "Oh my god, how can I go do this? This is so cool." And so these really work a charm both from a reach standpoint, but also from a building authority, expertise, and kind of conversion standpoint.   [20:33]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "DAY 6: TRANSFORMATION/BREAKDOWN"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Conceito "Become Your Own Bank", breakdowns visuais aspiracionais   [20:35]  And then lastly, on day six, you kind of go over the transformation you achieved, which is like somewhat aspirational again, or you literally just go into an actual breakdown of your stuff.   [20:45]  So here's two different ones again. One is kind of like gives a controversial thought like aka become your own bank and people like okay that's not possible or whatever and they kind of read through it.   [20:56]  Or you just give them another visual breakdown of how you achieve the particular outcome.   [21:01]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "DAY 7: FREESTYLE - Memes/Entertainment"   NÚMEROS:  7 dias completados   VISUAL:  Exemplos de memes, conteúdo viral adaptado, entretenimento   [21:03]  And on day seven usually we kind of go a bit more like into just freestyle. You can either drop a meme, a real a tweet. Again, just something that like fits your persona that you want to present, gives more value to people and entertains, right?   [21:18]  Like we've done really well with some of these memes that are just funny. And if a real meme is going viral, we try to tweak it to like the client's business model or the actual context of everything.   [21:29]  Because again, if it's going viral, people will always want to see the iteration due to curiosity. And at that point, those really do well as well.   [21:37]  Does that make sense so far? Sweet.   [21:41]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Case Study: $1M+/Month Client"   NÚMEROS:  $1M+/mês, menos de $20K em ad spend   VISUAL:  Foto do cliente, métricas de sucesso destacadas   [21:43]  All right, you guys ready to go and get a breakdown of how this gentleman here is making over a million a month off of Instagram alone?   [21:51]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Client Background"   NÚMEROS:  100,000 seguidores iniciais, 3 vendas/mês, 15 meses de trabalho   VISUAL:  Timeline do projeto, transformação da conta   [21:53]  All right, so to start out with, we started with him about a year and 3 months ago. He was obviously big sales guy on a call and he was trying to convince us that his shitty account of like 100,000 followers was the best acquisition method he had ever seen because he was closing like three deals a month.   [22:10]  And through pretty much a two-hour sales call, we convinced him to start from zero. He went off pretty pissed off with his CRO because he actually allowed us to go and pitch him on a zero follower restart.   [22:24]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Positioning Strategy"   NÚMEROS:  $33M em comissões   VISUAL:  Reposicionamento de "algum cara" para "o cara de vendas número 1"   [22:26]  But pretty much what we said is right now you're positioned as some dude who's in PR and does sales, but nobody really knows who you are at scale, right?   [22:35]  And so we were like, hey, let's start from scratch and actually position you as like the number one sales guy. You're the guy who knows sales, who has like his own philosophy and all that stuff because he obviously has some form of authority, right?   [22:49]  I until this day haven't come across someone who's doing 33 million in commissions and so therefore we were like hey that's a great unique angle.   [22:58]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Brand Theme Options"   NÚMEROS:  3 opções de tema   VISUAL:  1) Subject Matter Expert, 2) Lifestyle Brand (flexing), 3) Story-Driven (relatable)   [23:00]  So that was really the whole you know basically premise of his brand. You can either go and say I want to be a subject matter expert which for him was super true.   [23:09]  You can go be a lifestyle brand which is like hey I'm just flexing on you. You're poor I'm rich like follow me.   [23:15]  Or you go into the realm of like I have a great story. I have a story to tell that you can resonate with. I'm super personable. Go follow me for that.   [23:23]  So for him it was really the theme brand was very simple and obviously because he has such an extensive feedback and experience in the space that was super simple.   [23:33]  With him it wasn't as much about like oh yeah here's my story and all that stuff. It was more about like if you want to get good at sales shut up listen to me implement what I'm saying you'll go make a ton of money. And it's worked really well.   [23:47]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Content Strategy: Authority Over Flexing"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Posts focados em autoridade de vendas, dicas de especialista, construção de confiança   [23:49]  So obviously rather than just like when you look at these posts we don't just flex much except for his authority like I know sales better than you. I can help you. I have all these sales tips because I'm a top expert sales rep.   [24:03]  And really, that built so much trust with his audience. After a while, we started like, you know, posting a bunch of reels at scale as well.   [24:11]  But all the premise was of it was, I'll give you value, you'll go be impressed eventually to go hit me in the DMs cuz you as a sales rep, you're not going to make much money and you want to learn how you can make more. And at that point, I'll pitch you.   [24:24]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Monetization Strategy"   NÚMEROS:  300-1,000 DMs por thread, 260K seguidores   VISUAL:  CTA nos threads, estratégia de DM, funil de conversão   [24:26]  And so from a monetization standpoint, this is really where it gets interesting. At the end of these threads, we just usually had this CTA that was like, "Hey, DM me the word skills and if you want to advance D, we'll go and help you."   [24:40]  At that point, when people go and scroll and they go for 10 slide, just like Jeremy said with the DSL, they're pretty much like, "Yo, I actually want to go learn more."   [24:49]  And usually we get between 300 to 1,000 DMs depending on how well it's performing. Obviously, depends on how many followers you have too, but that's kind of for him right now at 260k followers. That's pretty much the metric.   [25:03]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Stories Monetization"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Estratégia de stories, superação de objeções, CTAs diretos   [25:05]  And then what we do secondly is as well we go and pretty much we pretty much go and advertise on the stories.   [25:12]  So it could just be like oh I just got off a call with one of my prospects and here's an objection I had to overcome. Here's what he said. Here's how I overcame it and it's because I have this NPQ model.   [25:23]  Now if you want to go and learn how you can overcome any objection well drop me the DM like objections and we'll go and chat to you. Right?   [25:31]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Why Instagram DMs Win"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Comparação: Instagram vs TikTok vs Twitter, vantagens dos DMs do Instagram   [25:33]  Obviously, the whole goal, the whole premise of his brand was get people in the DMs because this is really where you go set apart Instagram from every other platform.   [25:42]  We tried Tik Tok. You need to either go and harass people through outbound or you need to hope that they go click the link in bio, which again, hope is not a strategy.   [25:51]  On Twitter, same thing. I really feel like the DM stuff is clunky and you don't get as much inbound traffic and reach, right?   [26:00]  And lastly, people really go and get convert to you or like really connect with you when they text you because they're dumb, right?   [26:08]  Like Paul here, he's amazing at DM sales. Whenever people DM him, he's like, "Hey man, do you want to go get a free starter guide on how to get into ATMs?"   [26:16]  And people think, "Oh my god, Paul just took time out of his day to go and text me." Whereas like freaking his DM setters.   [26:23]  And so people don't understand that there's like sales reps in there. And so they really have this like intimate connection with you because they feel like they texted you, you gave them value.   [26:33]  And you know, especially for him, he's also very good at sales obviously. They just go and be like, "Oh, hey, you're a sales rep. Here's a free podcast. Here's a free this."   [26:41]  And so they get so much value where they already show up on the call relatively hot and give you none of this usual like sales call BS.   [26:49]  So that's really the whole premise. I know it looks super basic, but it's just executing on these basics extremely well that helped him go and scale.   [26:58]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Client Results Breakdown"   NÚMEROS:  $1M+/mês, $15-20K/mês em ads, 25,000 seguidores/mês, 7-10K leads/semana, $40K por 1,000 seguidores   VISUAL:  Métricas completas de performance, breakdown financeiro detalhado   [27:00]  And so, as I told you, he's doing well over a million a month. Let me give you guys the breakdown.   [27:05]  On average right now, we're spending between 15 to 20K per month on ads on shoutouts. So on average, he's growing around 25,000 followers, give or take in the last 3 to 6 months.   [27:19]  So between the week, he gets around 7 to 10,000 leads every single week.   [27:25]  And off of that, he's collecting around $40,000 off of every 1,000 followers, which if you go and do the math, that's going to be a million a month.   [27:34]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Why It Works So Well"   NÚMEROS:  3 razões principais   VISUAL:  Lista de fatores de sucesso, explicação do sistema orgânico   [27:36]  Now, why does it work so well? I've spoken to a lot of people and they're like, "Hey, these ROAS just seem a bit like unrealistic."   [27:43]  And the reason it works is super simple because when you go and acquire a follower, they're kind of yours and you don't need to pay for them to advertise them.   [27:51]  They kind of follow you for a reason and it was their decision, which is such a big thing, right? When you go and direct response someone, you kind of got them to go and do it.   [28:01]  Whereas for them, it feels so organic from the point they follow you, from when they consume your content all the way up to when they actually go and buy your stuff.   [28:10]  At which point they're like, "Oh, yeah, actually I want to buy from this guy." And so they're selling themselves onto working with you and actually joining the sales call, which makes the whole sales process a lot easier.   [28:21]  And the second thing this works so well is because the moment you start engaging with them, you get in front of them every single day through stories, through feed content, through, you know, whatever it may be.   [28:32]  Where you have so much easier way to organically build trust rather than having to retarget them 10, 15, 20 times where they actually start to build a lot of trust organically with you.   [28:43]  And lastly, because when you see someone growing and spamming like, "Yo, I just bought this new car, you know, because I learned sales. I just did this and all my students are crushing it."   [28:54]  You start to have this little FOMO where you're like, "Ah, shoot. I've been looking at this for a while, but I've been on the sidelines."   [29:00]  And again, right, it's a common denominator of I reach out to you as the person because I feel stuck and I need that help.   [29:08]  So, it's like them selling themselves like, "Yeah, this is actually logical because all these other people are getting great results." And so that's really some of the commonalities that we've seen because they sell you.   [29:20]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "How This Can Help You"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Aplicações práticas, diferentes cenários de uso   [29:22]  Now, how can this help you? You know, maybe you don't want to go and run a full-blown Instagram shoutout agency. You know, who knows?   [29:30]  If you run Facebook ads, you can either go and try this for yourself if you have your own coaching or consulting program. You can either go and try it for your clients.   [29:40]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Webinar Strategy Application"   NÚMEROS:  100-300 signups orgânicos por webinar   VISUAL:  Estratégia de link in bio, comparação com Facebook ads   [29:42]  Or if you take one thing away from this presentation, here's what you can go and do. If your clients, I know me and Michael spoke about this, if his clients go and run webinars, he can literally go and implement the content strategy I've given away.   [29:57]  And you can just go and do that and put a click the link in the bio to join my free webinar. Outside of that, if you have some form of an organic audience, you'll go get a ton of signups.   [30:07]  I know every time our clients have run webinars, we've outperformed their Facebook ads guys off of the organic stuff alone just because there's so much traction going on.   [30:17]  Every single time we've run it, there's like 100, 200, 300 people organically signing up for their webinars, which like that's pretty good because again within the webinars, you go and get some of this group thing if there's like thousands of people there.   [30:30]  And then obviously you can always go and try to do it yourself. Even if you just want to go and do it, you run the shoutouts to promote the webinar or you just want the shout outs just grow an audience.   [30:40]  Because again, if you want to try and run Facebook ads, we all know that having some form of social proof apparently seems to help in the conversion. If I'm wrong, don't flame me on it. I've never run a single Facebook ad, so I'm just assuming at this point.
