Transcrição Completa: Scaling Intelligence - Creating Hyper Growth with Josh Troy   [00:00]  Awesome. Thanks, Jeremy. Can you guys hear me okay on this?   [00:02]  Yeah.   [00:03]  Cool. All right. So, to be fair, I do have a pretty lengthy presentation. I like Jeremy said, I'm very passionate about what I do. I do it obsessively. I'm very lucky and fortunate to say that every morning I wake up, my alarm goes off. I can't wait to get to work. It's like Christmas morning every single day.   [00:25]  I can't wait. And because of that, it's a huge asset of mine, but it makes things hard to condense into presentations because I could go an inch wide and a mile deep on almost all of these topics.   [00:38]  I haven't said to be clear the hundred million dollar exit, but that would be awesome if it happens. So, thanks for the strong intro, Jeremy.   [00:47]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Scaling Intelligence - Creating Hyper Growth for Direct Response and Sales Ops-Driven Business Models"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Título principal da apresentação   [00:52]  So this presentation is, as you could see here, it's called scaling intelligence and creating hyper growth for direct response and sales ops-driven business models. Raise your hand if that's your business, by the way. You're either direct response or a sales operation, right? Pretty much everyone.   [01:12]  It's pretty much the space that we're all in here. And I want to just start by saying that because of my involvement in sales and building teams and companies over the years, I am very frequently approached for sales consulting and advice on scaling sales operations.   [01:28]  And what I find to be really ironic is that most of the time the expectation is that I'm going to go into a sales training presentation. But we are not sales reps here, right? These are business owners. Most of you guys, your CEOs, you're scaling companies.   [01:44]  Scaling a sales operation does not have to do with me telling you guys how to close on the phone, right? We're all on the same page. So, this presentation is going to be a little bit different.   [01:56]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  Instagram handle displayed   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Informação de contato social media - troy.joshua   [01:58]  There's my Instagram, by the way, if you guys don't follow me, troy.joshua.   [02:03]  And so, I'm going to just go through a kind of more holistic approach to high-intensity scaling and creating hyper hyper growth. And one of the things I want to say, you know, in masterminds, which I love, by the way, I love getting around like-minded people.   [02:20]  But what I would say with marketing masterminds is it's very customer focused or excuse me, customer acquisition focused as it should be. That's what we all do. But I think sometimes we forget that we can't just grow a business by being marketers. We have to be business owners and CEOs.   [02:39]  And so I want to talk about all of the other things today, frankly, because I'm tired of a lack of sophistication. One of the most interesting things about this space because of how scalable the business models are, because of how leveraged it is in what we do is there's a bunch of idiots making a ton of money.   [02:58]  We've all seen it, right? And I mean like a lot of money. I have some clients and I would never call them an idiot, but I have some clients that literally make tens of millions of dollars and don't really know the first thing about business. It's just a very scalable model.   [03:17]  They found one of you guys marketers, growth partners, and their business blew up. And so what I want to kind of emphasize, and fair disclaimer, I don't know if this is the most exciting presentation because I like to talk about the shit that we need to do, not the shit that we always necessarily want to do.   [03:38]  And I'm a huge fan of doing the boring shit. Now, most people, they do consider spreadsheets a little bit boring. I live in spreadsheets. I love it. So, there's a disclaimer. It might be not the most exciting, but just so you know, it's the most exciting to me.   [03:56]  And I think the reason I love spreadsheets, it's this very cathartic, euphoric experience for me because if you're modeling something out, you can see your business, your future state business like in a spreadsheet. It produces a lot of endorphins, right? It produces dopamine.   [04:14]  And aside from that, most anxiety comes from the fear of the unknown. So when I could see exactly what it's going to take to do something, it takes a lot of that anxiety away. I love spreadsheets.   [04:27]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Presentation Overview"   NÚMEROS:  Tens of millions (mencionado verbalmente)   VISUAL:  Estrutura da apresentação com bullets points   [04:29]  And so I'm going to go through this. This presentation is going to be taught kind of from the lessons learned from tens of millions in direct response high ticket sales. Some anecdotal experiences on why some brands I notice rapid scale rapidly and some don't.   [04:47]  I'll reveal some of our playbooks and battle tested frameworks for scaling sales ops-driven businesses. I will go through that part of the presentation. And lastly, some insights from alcoholically studying VC funded companies and PE firms.   [05:04]  I am an alcoholic. I've been sober for almost 12 years now. And I often joke about the fact that the addiction just changed, right? I channel that all into this now and I've just been studying these things alcoholically.   [05:21]  So, let's dive in. What are CEOs really good at? Right? I believe that the best CEOs, the best business owners are masters of engineering desired future outcomes and then knowing how to shrink those time frames, collapse the time frames to scale, right?   [05:42]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "What are CEOs Really Good At?"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Conceito de engenharia de resultados futuros e colapso de time frames   [05:45]  There's a really good book, I think it's called the outsiders with unconventional CEOs. And the entire book speaks from an angle that the best CEOs in the world see themselves as capital allocators.   [06:00]  The entire business in terms of projects that they run, initiatives that they focus on, it's all through a returns analysis to figure out what's going to give them the most leverage, what's going to give them the best returns.   [06:14]  And so I describe this concept as crystal ball operators. Three important words. How do we get clarity, certainty, and intention on what it's going to take to scale our business to the desired level of scale in the fastest time frame possible?   [06:33]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Crystal Ball Operators - Clarity, Certainty, Intention"   NÚMEROS:  3 palavras importantes   VISUAL:  Três conceitos chave destacados   [06:36]  Now, I have the word forecast up here in the definition. I just think it's a fascinating definition, right? It literally means to predict or estimate. And so, for me, I want to predict exactly what's going to happen in my business, right? You could almost be like a psychic CEO.   [06:56]  And the way that we do this, right, vision is what you want. That's how you get clarity. Strategy is what to do to get there. And then we get a bunch of certainty that we know how to get there. And a plan is obviously how to do it, right? That's what we call intention.   [07:14]  Clarity, certainty, and intention. And a successful business is just a result of a series of intentional actions.   [07:23]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Three Areas of Scaling"   NÚMEROS:  3 áreas   VISUAL:  Lista de três pilares principais   [07:25]  And so the three areas of scaling that I want to talk through here today, we're going to start with reverse business planning and financial fluency, the overall concept. Then we're going to go into operational execution. And that's where I'm going to share some of our sales playbooks, some of the methodologies that we deploy.   [07:44]  And then I'm going to end on aggressive reinvestment, which I'm really, really passionate about. And as you heard in the speaker right before me, did you hear what he said? He said, "I put every single dollar back into the business." And it is so freaking important.   [08:02]  You don't have to do every dollar, but I'm going to end by talking about that because it is quite literally the catalyst to growth right now. My hopes, by the way, is because I have to go through these things kind of fast just so the length of the presentation fits today and I don't want you guys to get bored.   [08:22]  But if any of these things excite you, we could have a deeper conversation once I'm off here, right? All right.   [08:30]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Reverse Business Planning and Financial Fluency"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Primeiro pilar da apresentação destacado   [08:32]  Reverse business planning and financial fluency. Now, the business planning methodology, it's called reverse business planning. So the idea is very simple. It's very self-explanatory. We're identifying the desired outcome. We're starting at the end. Where do we want to be? How big do we want our business to be? And we're reverse engineering to figure out exactly what needs to happen to turn that into reality.   [08:59]  Right? I'll break this down in a second. Show of hands before I do this. Who actually builds budgets for their business? By the way, be really honest here. A couple people. That excites me because that's why I'm speaking on this today. Only a couple people build budgets.   [09:20]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Three Main Tools"   NÚMEROS:  3 ferramentas, 12 meses   VISUAL:  Lista de três ferramentas principais de planejamento   [09:22]  Right now, this is like one of the most important things to me when we're scaling a business. There's three main tools that I use, and I use them daily, constantly. Like I said, I live in the spreadsheets. The first one's a budget. I personally do it on a 12-month plan.   [09:39]  Now, I've worked with some really big names that specialize in this stuff that I won't use in the presentation, but they teach people how to scale and exit companies, and there's all different methodologies on it. Sometimes it's three-year budgets.   [09:54]  I don't believe in three-year budgets because I've never seen one be accurate or even remotely close. The day that somebody shows me, hey, here's our three-year budget, and we hit it, I'll consider it. Until then, I build them out to be 12 months. But I do build a three-year snapshot.   [10:12]  I'm going to break all this down in a second. The second one is an operating model, which is just a forecasted P&L. It's also referred to as a rolling forecast. I'm sure you guys have heard of that. The third one is a tool called a 90-day cash flow analyzer.   [10:28]  It's basically a short form proforma where I'm modeling out the impact of certain decisions that I would make to take action on them over the next quarter.   [10:40]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Components and Steps of Building a Budget"   NÚMEROS:  9 componentes   VISUAL:  Lista numerada de 1 a 9 com componentes do orçamento   [10:42]  And so here are the components and the steps of building a budget that I want to pretty swiftly take you guys through here today. The first thing is unit economics. You know Jeremy was talking earlier about leveling up your guys' business through offer design, through backend, through upsell, whatever it is.   [11:00]  I can't tell you how many people in this space, they don't even know their unit economics and so they don't even understand the gross margin before their customer acquisition costs and so they start scaling something that's going to have really thin margins just because you can't change unit economics at scale. Unit economics is the most base level, right?   [11:22]  The second thing is the second thing in the budget is revenue drivers and growth assumptions. I'll read through these real quick so I could show you a slide on each. The third is I build capacity assumptions and I start to brainstorm the org chart.   [11:37]  The fourth is comp planning and hiring schedules. Fifth is expense assumptions. Six is a revenue forecast with a very specific growth model. Seven is a full P&L forecast. Eight is capital structure where we break down reserves distribution versus reinvestment ratios.   [11:58]  And then number nine is a return and exits analysis which I would think you would all care about. So what I want to challenge everybody to do is to build your business in a spreadsheet, right?   [12:11]  Imagine if you could build your entire business in a spreadsheet. You know exactly how many employees you have for each level of scale. You know exactly who you need. You know exactly what your org chart looks like. You know the comp plan for all of them. Imagine what that would do for you.   [12:28]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Unit Economics"   NÚMEROS:  70-80% (margem ideal), 20-30% (CAC), 50% (margem bruta), 30% (margem líquida)   VISUAL:  Tabela mostrando preço, inclusões, custos e margem de lucro unitário   [12:30]  Right? Here's unit economics. This one's very straightforward. You guys could do it if you could see it on the screen right here. You have your price point and then all you have is your inclusions and the price of each inclusion and you could get to your unit economic profit margin right there.   [12:48]  Right? So most of the time especially in our space that's who I'm speaking to. I don't know about other industries. If you could get between 70 to 80% on your unit economics, that's going to give you great margin because then you could spend 20, 30% on your customer acquisition cost and still be at roughly a 50% gross margin, right?   [13:10]  So if you put 20% of OPEX against that, you're still left with a 30% net margin. So it's really important to start at the top.   [13:19]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Revenue Drivers and Growth Assumptions"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado claramente   VISUAL:  Planilha com colunas para número de clientes, CPA, receita média por conta, taxa de crescimento   [13:22]  Now the first thing that you do in the actual budget, unit economics is kind of like a precursor. The first thing that we want to build in a spreadsheet is your revenue drivers, right? Your revenue drivers and growth assumptions. What is actually going to fuel growth, right?   [13:38]  And this all ties together, guys, throughout the whole presentation. I'm just talking about the spreadsheet element here first. But if you want to scale the fastest, it has to start here. So, what are the revenue assumptions? Now, these are just examples and screenshots for mine. I sanitize the numbers so I'm not just throwing out all of my personal stuff here.   [13:58]  But, you know, if you guys are scaling with accounts, right, if that's the way that you grow is client acquisition, you might model out how many clients you think you could get per month. What's the actual CPAs on that? What's the average revenue per account, right? What's your account month over month growth rate? If you guys are scaling your clients, you want to start obviously by mapping out the revenue.   [14:23]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Capacity Assumptions"   NÚMEROS:  48 calls/mês, 160 calls (exemplo de capacidade de vendedor), 8 calls/dia, 22 dias úteis   VISUAL:  Tabela mostrando capacidade por posição e cálculos de quando contratar   [14:25]  The next thing is the capacity assumptions. Now, this is so important, right? The capacity assumption is how much output each individual position has, right? We know this. So, let's say that you have a coaching business. Raise your hand if you have one. Coaching business. Who has like one-on-one coaching in your guys' fulfillment?   [14:47]  What kind of business is it?   [14:49]  We coach e-commerce brands.   [14:51]  E-commerce brands. How many hours of coaching can one one-on-one coach give?   [14:56]  I can do 48 calls a month.   [14:58]  48 calls? Yeah. So that would be roughly 48 students a month I can do one-on-one call with.   [15:04]  They only have one call.   [15:06]  Yes.   [15:07]  Okay. So every 48 students roughly you need another coach, right? So, that would be a good capacity assumption to put in here because if he has whatever 48 times 5 would be in here, if you're modeling out on a budget, it's going to automatically show you you need five coaches by that point, right?   [15:28]  So, this is what capacity does for you at every single level of the budget. Ideally, everything's dynamic. You just press one button and the whole spreadsheet changes, right?   [15:40]  So, here's a different example of capacity for sales reps. This is one of the most important things for capacity. And you could back into capacity all different ways, but well, I'll circle back to this in a second, but a lot of the times when you're scaling a sales operation, the number one bottleneck for capacity is more sales reps for more calendar space, right? For more call capacity.   [16:04]  So, if you have like eight calls a day with the amount of average working days in a month, maybe it's 160 calls. Every 160 calls, you need a new salesperson. Now, the thing about hiring a new salesperson is it might take you two, three weeks to hire them. It might take one to two weeks to train them. It might take one to two weeks to get them performing in KPI, right?   [16:26]  So, you don't want to wait however many weeks that is to hire somebody if you know ahead of time who you're going to need to hire by the time you get to that level of calls. This is, you know, this is the process with speed. When you see it in a budget, you're always actually scaling preemptively and ahead of time.   [16:47]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Hiring Schedule"   NÚMEROS:  $10M, $20M (níveis de receita mencionados)   VISUAL:  Planilha com posições, cenários de compensação e "Hiring RTC" (Revenue to Company)   [16:49]  The next thing I do that for positions that are not necessarily capacity based like your opex positions, director of sales, director of operations, whoever it is, you're going to build out a hiring schedule, right?   [17:03]  So, this is so important to look at what your organization's going to look like at each level of scale. And so, you might say, okay, what is my actual org chart going to be when we're at 10 million, when we're at 20 million? Who do we need to have in place?   [17:18]  And so what I do, and you'll see that everything's scenario modeled here, right? Because I want to test it. What if I did this? What if I paid that amount? What if the comp plan changes to this? I want to see how that impacts margin and bottom line.   [17:32]  And then on the very right hand side, it says hiring RTC, hiring revenue to company. So based on the dollar amount of revenue, that's when it tells the model when that person would be populated in. Right? So, if it says I'm hiring someone at 10 million revenue and we're at 8 million in revenue, when you go to that line item in the P&L, it'll say zero.   [17:54]  But if it's above 10 million, it will pencil in whatever that comp plan is. So, it's automatically dynamically showing me who I need to hire and how it affects the profit margin as we scale.   [18:08]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Expense Assumptions"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Lista de despesas incluindo closers, setters, comissões, bases SDR, fornecedores, contabilidade, jurídico, marketing, software, assistentes virtuais   [18:10]  Then you have the rest of your expense assumptions, right? So, what I just went over is basically labor based positions. Everything else, all of your other expenses are here. So, at the top there's closers, setters, commissions. We have SDR bases, and then I just put some random examples of some vendors.   [18:28]  You might have accounting, legal fees, marketing vendor, freelancers, maybe you have strategic referral partners, software, GNA, virtual assistants. You want to have all of them program into here. Now, if they're fixed, if they're flat, just put what it is. If it's formula based, maybe you want to go with the percentage of revenue, but you want that to all obviously populate in the budget here as well.   [18:52]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Revenue Forecast"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado claramente   VISUAL:  Modelo de funil VSSL como exemplo, diferentes modelos de aquisição de clientes   [18:54]  Then you're going to build the revenue forecast. Now, please follow with me. This is probably the most boring part of the presentation, but this has to be done to be able to do the rapid scaling stuff that I'm going to talk about here shortly.   [19:08]  So, you have your whole revenue forecast. Now, this is a random example. Actually, I was using this model for a potential acquisition. You always want to model out the specific growth model of how you're going to grow it. So, as an example, let's say that you're doing a VSSL funnel. You would want to model that funnel in, right?   [19:29]  You want it to be really specific. If you're doing the what what's Jeremy call it? The Hydra with all the lead form stuff. Maybe you want to model that out, but you want to map the revenue based on whatever customer acquisition model you're actually planning on using to facilitate that growth. Right?   [19:48]  Here's just another example of one that I did.   [19:52]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Full P&L Forecast"   NÚMEROS:  12 meses   VISUAL:  Demonstração de resultados completa com todas as premissas anteriores integradas   [19:54]  And then you're going to model out the full P&L. Right? So now it's going to take all of those assumptions and it's going to actually build it in the spreadsheet for you. So you've all seen what this looks like. Just imagine a P&L. I hope you guys have a monthly profit and loss you're looking at. I know a lot of people don't.   [20:12]  But the whole model should be dynamic pulling from all the foregoing assumptions and schedules, right? So I want to do that for 12 months. And I can't articulate the insights that you get just from doing this first exercise, before I even played with the scenarios before I even tried to find efficiencies.   [20:30]  Just simply looking at it, you know, people might be like, "Holy shit we're only going to have a 10% margin." And they need to start making adjustments right away to it, right? So, you just want to have that all in the spreadsheet. Now, it's a dynamic model you could constantly play with.   [20:47]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Year 3 Snapshot"   NÚMEROS:  3 anos   VISUAL:  Projeção de longo prazo usando taxa de crescimento anual   [20:49]  Now, the reason I do 12 months is because that's all I can kind of more accurately control going forward. I don't know where we're going to be in three years, but the reason I build one snapshot year three. So, what I'll do to be clear, build a whole model of a forecast, right, for 12 months and then just use an annual growth rate for year two and three.   [21:11]  So, that will get you your year three snapshot target. And what I like to do is I like to sit there and say, "What does my company look like at scale? What does it look like when we're at X amount of revenue three years down the road?"   [21:26]  Now, why is that important? Can anyone just throw out some comments on why it's so important to look at your most evolved state of your business?   [21:36]  You can start facing where business to get to that scale.   [21:39]  Yeah. So maybe strategic initiatives that tells you how to get there faster. That's a great one.   [21:45]  You might not realize you're going to get where you want or you might not be able to exit for what you want.   [21:50]  Yeah. You might not be going the right way. You might not be building the company the right way, which is kind of maybe the key point here is I can't tell you guys when you're not looking in the future of like what do we need to be at scale, you build the business the wrong way.   [22:06]  You hire people you shouldn't have hired. You get stuck in this like low margin type of model and then you build entire departments that aren't actually scalable and then you have to go backwards. And so this is what it means to reverse business plan like start like where do you want to be? What level of revenue do you want to have and what does your operation look like and then build it in that manner, right?   [22:32]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Key Questions for Year 3"   NÚMEROS:  Ano 3   VISUAL:  Lista de perguntas estratégicas sobre receita, clientes, equipe, estrutura organizacional   [22:34]  And so these are some questions, right? So how much revenue do you have at that point? How many customers do you have? What's your management team look like? What's the organization chart look like? How many salespeople are needed? What do you think the hardest part will be? Probably the most important question there. What do you think the hardest part will be as you grow?   [22:56]  Okay, I'll circle back to that in one moment.   [23:00]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Capital Structure"   NÚMEROS:  3 meses (reserva agressiva), 6 meses (reserva preferida)   VISUAL:  Estrutura mostrando reserva mínima, distribuição vs. reinvestimento   [23:02]  Then at the bottom of this, I look at a capital structure. Capital structure, without getting into debt and leverage and all these other things of how you're financing a business, what I'm just simply stating here is what's your minimum reserve target, which I recommend everyone build. And then what's your distribution versus reinvestment ratio?   [23:22]  Right? So said differently, what's the least amount of money you need to take out of your business monthly? You should know that number after a reserve, right? So I don't know if you want to be more aggressive, maybe a three-month reserve. I personally like a six-month reserve.   [23:37]  After that, how much money needs to be taken out of the business for me to be comfortable with it. Everything else is the resources to grow. I'll circle back to that here later.   [23:48]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Returns and Exit Analysis"   NÚMEROS:  3-6x EBITDA (múltiplo realista), $30 milhões (exemplo de valor de empresa)   VISUAL:  Tabela mostrando diferentes cenários de múltiplos e valores de saída   [23:50]  Right now, lastly, you're going to have your returns and exit analysis. So, this is really exciting to me. Anyone want to sell their business? That'd be cool to sell your business one day, right? I personally think that every business should be built to be sold, even if you don't actually end up selling it because that's how you build the most valuable business and you build yourself out of the day-to-day.   [24:14]  But after you have your whole P&L there and you back into basically EBITDA, now you could just apply different scenarios for multiples. I just have a realistic range here between a 3 to 6x EBITDA and you could just look at that and at different levels of scale you could see how much your company would be worth.   [24:34]  Kind of cool, right? Especially if you know the multiple your industry trades at, you could see, okay, wow, once I get to here, I have a $30 million business. I like to know that at all times.   [24:47]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Operating Model (Rolling Forecast)"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Conceito de orçamento fixo vs. previsão atualizada continuamente   [24:49]  The operating model is a - So, now you have your budget. It's fixed. It's set in stone. The whole thing with the budget is it's fixed. Export it as a PDF. You don't make any changes. But then you have a rolling forecast that's always updated based on actuals when things are changing.   [25:08]  You want to know like how close are we to that? You know, you don't want to go off a static budget the whole year because things are rapidly changing. Maybe you're crushing your budget and you want to speed things up and improve the assumptions. But that's what a rolling forecast is.   [25:24]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "90-Day Cash Flow Analyzer"   NÚMEROS:  90 dias, $10,000 (exemplo de retainer), $15,000 (exemplo de novo preço), 20% (potencial perda de clientes)   VISUAL:  Proforma trimestral com análise de fluxo e comparação de cenários   [25:26]  And then this is one of my favorite models right here. It's a 90-day cash flow analyzer. It's basically a proforma, right? So, the 90-day cash flow analyzer, what I have here, as you could see, I have my gross margin assumptions, or excuse me, my gross margin assumptions here, and then I have the flux analysis and the model changes.   [25:47]  So, what I'm looking at every quarter, I'm looking at this. I'm saying, okay, what if I change my pricing? You guys ever ask those questions? Should I increase my pricing? What will happen? Right? You charge a $10,000 retainer. You're really curious to know what's the financial impact if you charge $15,000, but then you get worried and you say, "Well, how many customers will say yes to this? What if 20% less people actually sign with me?"   [26:16]  Well, what does that look like? Don't tell me you do it in your head cuz nobody really can. So, I model these things out and you're always the main test that you have. You want to build that and I put the actuals in.   [26:30]  So, here's what it looks like. I build a base case and a bear case. So, a base case is like my best guess. A bear case is worst case scenario. I don't mess with best case because it doesn't really matter. You're good at that point, right?   [26:45]  So, your worst case scenario, the only difference between the two is you're plugging in this is my best guess of what's going to happen this quarter based on these assumptions. And here's the worst case. And the only difference between those two, I highlight them in red and then I have the insights at the end.   [27:03]  So now I know every single quarter based on the budget and what I'm trying to accomplish. I'm trying to see what I can improve. Where can I increase profitability? How can I get more clients? How do I change the model? And then you basically know your worst case scenario when you're scaling and how aggressive you could be.   [27:22]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Key Takeaways - Financial Planning"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Lista de insights principais sobre planejamento financeiro   [27:24]  All right. So let's do some takeaways really quickly here. I do scenario modeling for everything because I want to know the differences between them. I understand the underpinning operation to support the different levels of scale. We can't just be looking at revenue at certain levels of revenue. What does your staff look like? What's fulfillment look like? How many coaches do you have? How many sales reps do you have? You want to know these things, right?   [27:50]  Familiarize yourself with the dependencies and run rates, which means basically how long those initiatives take so you're always ahead of schedule. Analyze utilization ratios for reinvestment periods, test margin, hypothesize what will break at scale, and clearly see the largest constraints at scale.   [28:11]  So that I want to focus in on that last one right there. What will break at scale? Clearly see the largest constraints. So when you're looking into the future like that and you're looking at a budget and as your company's growing, you need to always ask what's going to break next.   [28:29]  And I care about Ryan a lot, so it's awkward to say, but you guys are going to hear what happens when you don't do this in the next speech, right? You're going to hear what happens when you're not looking ahead and when you aren't kind of preemptively building a business around the core value engines for the things that are going to collapse once you get too big too fast, right?   [28:51]  And so we are always building core value engines around that so we could build the business the right way. Okay? So what I do is I focus on validating and building the key value engines that will minimize the constraints to scale.   [29:08]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Core Value Engines"   NÚMEROS:  4-5 sales reps (contratados em um voo), 87 páginas (SOP de CRM), 72 horas (implementação)   VISUAL:  Exemplos de motores de valor: aquisição de talentos, gestão de vendas, configuração de CRM   [29:10]  Right? So here's some examples. Predictable talent acquisition and development, right? I was flying here on the plane two days ago. I landed. We hired four or five sales reps when I was in the plane, right? My team did. That's because I have a predictable talent acquisition department, right?   [29:30]  I have a director of talent acquisition. We have hiring funnels going all day long. I treat talent acquisition like all of you treat customer acquisition, right? We literally have VSSLs. We have entire funnels. They're really really important to us because I know as an outsourced sales partner if I can't predictably create and produce top performers I don't have a business model.   [29:53]  So that was a really big important department for us to build right away, right? Transferable sales management. Same thing we do a lot of passive candidate generation for that. We really quickly understood that just through inbound ads we're not - it works well for closers and setters. It doesn't work well for sales management.   [30:12]  So we do passive candidate outreach where we're basically sourcing and poaching for sales management and directors and then our CRM configuration, right? Our systems are the number one thing to get the ROAS we need for our clients because of this devil of a word called revenue leakage. I'll talk about more soon.   [30:32]  If I know that that's going to be one of the number one things that prevents me from duplicating success on all of my clients, we have to build something that's so prolific so we don't hit that bottleneck. Right? So we hired a director of sales operations. We have an 87-page CRM configuration SOP. It's implemented within 72 hours of signing a new client.   [30:55]  Right? This is the type of stuff I'm talking about. When you build a budget, you get really, really clear on what's going to break at scale.   [31:04]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Operational Execution"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Segundo pilar principal da apresentação   [31:06]  Okay, that's the financial fluency part. Now, we go into operational execution. I love studying private equity playbooks. Private equity and VC. I don't know if you guys do that. You should because they scale better than anyone else. So, that's all I study.   [31:24]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "PE/VC Scaling Concepts"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Lista de conceitos: Build-Measure-Learn loops, Validated Learning, PMF x Distribution, Blitzscaling, Corporate Development   [31:26]  And there's some concepts that they go through. Build measure learn loops, validated learning which is basically how do you validate assumptions as fast as possible. PMF times distribution - PMF is product market fit and they need to amplify by whatever distribution works the best which is essentially marketing and sales.   [31:47]  Blitzscaling - buy growth through reinvestment and corporate development which is leveraged partnerships. All of these things I just went over which I'll talk through in these next several slides - it's just how to scale the fastest. All of these concepts from PE and VC are about collapsing time frames.   [32:09]  Does anyone know what corporate development is? Just a couple of us, right? It's really interesting. The biggest companies in the world, they have an entire department and all they do is figure out what partnerships they could make, what companies they could buy, what distribution they can have, what licensing deals to sign just to collapse the time frame to revenue instead of organic revenue growing revenue one-to-one. Right?   [32:36]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Validation and Speed"   NÚMEROS:  2 palavras mais importantes   VISUAL:  Destaque para os dois conceitos fundamentais de scaling   [32:38]  Two most important words that I've learned in scaling, especially sales ops, is validation and speed. They're my two favorite words, validation and speed. I'm going to talk about a validation sequence here in a second. We have to validate all the variables in our sales engine as fast as we possibly can so we could rapidly scale.   [33:00]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Scaling Framework"   NÚMEROS:  2 componentes   VISUAL:  Mapeamento de crescimento previsível + remoção de restrições   [33:02]  So scaling any business, it really comes down to these two things. We're mapping predictable growth where removing the constraints to scale. That's all it is in our space. The way that we scale with direct response is you scale ad spend. The number one constraint is increase call capacity. Am I right?   [33:22]  If it's lead gen, if you have a call funnel, it's very easy to scale. Me and Jeremy, I talk shit to him all the time because we're trying to scale and we're talking about it. We do a lot of deals together. We have for a number of years and he goes, "Oh yeah, I just got to flip a knob." I'm like, "Well, f you. We have to go hire eight sales reps and do all these other things, right? It's different."   [33:45]  But the way you scale is ad spend and the capacity or excuse me the constraint is increasing call capacity.   [33:54]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Two Prerequisites to Scale"   NÚMEROS:  2 pré-requisitos   VISUAL:  Lista simples e direta dos únicos requisitos   [33:56]  There's really only two constraints or two prerequisites to scale. There's only two. Okay. Jeremy gave me a signal which I told him to give me to gauge how much faster I need to go and I need to go faster. So all right.   [34:12]  There's only two prerequisites to doing so when you're scaling. Hit minimum ROAS, hire and ramp sales reps. That is the only thing, guys. It is crazy to me clients that sit at the same revenue level over and over and over and over and over. And it's like they're like, "Why do why aren't we making more money?" Dude, you haven't scaled the ad spend. That's it, right?   [34:37]  Like, look at a budget, look at a spreadsheet, double the ad spend, and we just need to hire more sales reps. So, those are the only two prerequisites.   [34:47]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "The Golden Formula"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Lead Flow x Sales Performance = Revenue   [34:49]  So the golden formula in our space is lead flow times sales performance equals revenue. Like I said, validation and speed. We need to validate both variables.   [35:02]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Customer Acquisition Models"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado claramente   VISUAL:  Modelos de atividade mostrando ad spend, custo por call, número de calls necessárias   [35:04]  So if we go into growth planning, I won't talk about the models again because I just talked about that. But if you guys have seen these in the group, those came from me. These are customer acquisition models I have for every single funnel. You need to model out the ad spend and the average cost per call to see how many calls you're going to have to know how many reps to hire. It's also called an activity model.   [35:28]  Now, it's amazing to me because a lot of the times if I'm going into a business, I'm doing a deal or I'm consulting on something and they're asking me how much revenue to get to where and I can't tell you how many times I put it in a spreadsheet and I go, "Oh, you just need to increase your ad spend. That's it. You just need to increase your ad spend because they don't even have the proper input to hit the desired outcome." Right? It all goes back to the spreadsheets.   [35:57]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "FQC Report"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Forecast, Quota, Commitment - estrutura de gerenciamento de vendas   [35:59]  Right? Now, what we do from here as a sales organization, we take those budgets, right? This is why it's so important by the way because everything stems from it. The way we manage our team, the KPIs that govern what we do, they come from those budgets and forecasts.   [36:16]  So once we have that forecast, what we do is we take that monthly target and then we break that down by the amount of sales reps we have and that becomes our quota. This shit isn't rocket science. So we have a FQC report. It stands for forecast, quota, and commitment. We take the forecast, we break it into individual quotas, and they commit to us that they're going to hit it.   [36:40]  And all they have to do to hit it is hit the target KPIs that we manage against the entire time. In a second here, I'll show how we make sure that we're on track for that every month.   [36:51]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Validating Lead Flow"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Batalha marketing vs vendas, necessidade de modelo de scoring sofisticado   [36:53]  So, we're validating lead flow right now. It's the infamous battle between marketing and sales. Marketing blames sales performance. Sales blames lead quality. Everybody laughs because we've all done that.   [37:06]  Now, in the absence of a sophisticated lead scoring model, which is the first thing you have to have to validate lead flow, it's nearly impossible to know why conversions are low. Is it the lead quality? Is it the type of funnel? Is it the sales reps? Is the pitch wrong? Is the offer weak? Is the price too high?   [37:26]  Literally, no one ever ever knows. I was just talking to somebody about this outside. He's like, "I don't know if it's my sales reps or it's my offer. It's my marketing." Nobody ever knows. You have to start with a sophisticated lead scoring model.   [37:42]  Right now, the main concern with implementing a lead scoring model, when I say sophisticated lead scoring model, what I'm not talking about is an application that says how much money you have, and if they don't put a lot, you don't put them into a call. That's what I'm not talking about. I saw a couple of smiles over here because that's what a lot of people do.   [38:03]  You actually have to gauge propensity. What leads to propensity in buying behavior? Financial capability could be one. It's also level of awareness. It's how much content they consumed. It's how long they've been considering the decision. So, we use these things to build a sophisticated lead scoring model.   [38:24]  They get assigned a score and that's how we decide where to what disposition for the lead. Are they going to the closer, a setter, a low ticket product, more content? It all depends on the outcome of this.   [38:38]  The main concern that especially marketers have in introducing a sophisticated lead scoring model is they say, "Oh, well, CPAs are going to go through the roof because we're adding way more friction to the funnel." Now, the flawed logic here is that you're preventing buyers from buying.   [38:56]  I love buyers. My whole business is getting more buyers. If you do it correctly, you're not preventing buyers from buying. You're preventing tire kickers from taking precious time off the closer calendar because it's limited. It's limited and it adds complexity to scale, right?   [39:16]  Going faster in a keyword, it's propensity.   [39:21]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Lead Scoring Disposition"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Fluxo de qualificação: imediatamente qualificado → closer, semi-qualificado → setter, não qualificado → conteúdo/nurture   [39:23]  Now, listen really closely here. These next few slides. So, what we do with the lead scoring is someone who's immediately qualified, they go to a closer calendar. Semi-qualified goes to a setter's calendar. If they're not qualified at all, we don't put them on a call. We put them to some other shit - Content nurture low ticket.   [39:45]  So, when we're listening to calls to validate lead flow, we have to make sure that we're comparing apples to apples. Okay? Okay, I'm going to show you this in a second.   [39:56]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "CRM Dispositions"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Campo aberto de disposição no CRM, razões individuais de desqualificação   [39:58]  Now, CRM dispositions. This is the second thing we do to validate lead flow in your CRM. You know, you can't ask the sales team. This is what you guys all want to eliminate, right? Eliminate the word lead quality from your vocabulary. How's the lead quality? They're going to tell you one of two things, good or bad. It's not helpful either way, right?   [40:20]  Oh, it's low financial capability. What you need to do is you have to set up a field in the CRM, a disposition. It's an open field. Don't do a drop down because it's going to be just as subjective. You want the individual reasons. Every single lead was not qualified and it's a force field. So the sales rep has to put it before they close the lead loss.   [40:43]  I'm not talking about loss reasons. I'm talking about disqualification reasons. That's going to get you more data than any sales team has ever got you before. Right?   [40:53]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Validating Sales Performance"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Transição para análise de performance de vendas   [40:55]  Then you move into validating sales performance. Right? I'm going to have to go through this a little faster.   [41:02]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Validation Sequence"   NÚMEROS:  4 etapas   VISUAL:  Sequência: Lead Quality → Sales Performance → Pitch Design → Offer Design   [41:04]  So what we have is a call analysis guide. Right now, this is called a validation sequence. It's the reason people can't answer these questions on how you're validating lead flow. This is the last piece of validating lead flow, and it segues into sales performance.   [41:20]  When you're validating lead flow, there's four things we do. You're first validating lead quality, then sales performance, then pitch design, then offer design. Check out how this works.   [41:33]  The first thing we have to do is make sure the right person's on the phone. Do we have the right avatar? If we have the right person on the phone, is the sales rep strong? Are they following process? Are they doing what they're supposed to do? Are they a closer?   [41:47]  But let me ask you this. If you have the right person on the phone and you have great closers, and it's still not converting, why? What then? Well, you have to cycle through multiple different pitches, multiple different talk tracks, multiple different ways of positioning it on the phone. Most people don't do this.   [42:08]  If you have the right person on the phone, a great sales team, multiple different pitches, and it's not converting, your offer sucks. You have to change it, right? We go through this validation sequence constantly and that's how we scale so fast because you're constantly figuring out what's not working, right?   [42:29]  No matter how many calls you listen to, you're all obviously going to need quantitative as well. I'm skipping through this just because of the time, but with revenue leakage, revenue leakage is the most deadly words. That's why Harry Potter's here because I thought of Voldemort.   [42:47]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Revenue Leakage"   NÚMEROS:  8 calls/dia, 22 dias úteis, 176 deals abertos/mês por rep   VISUAL:  Imagem de Voldemort, conceito de "palavra proibida", cálculo de volume de deals   [42:49]  It's the most deadly words to your sales organization. Think about this. High velocity sales ops, right? If you have eight new calls a day, 22 working days, it's 176 new open deals per month per rep. How the hell are they going to manage it without robust systems? Right?   [43:10]  Everyone's like, "Sales reps suck this and that, blah, blah, blah." You don't have any systems, no systems, and they're getting 176 deals a month, right? Without really robust systems, you're not going to be able to manage them.   [43:25]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "CRM System - Priority Buckets"   NÚMEROS:  87 páginas (SOP), 180 páginas mencionadas verbalmente   VISUAL:  Sistema de priority views, smart filters, buckets organizados por proximidade de conversão   [43:27]  And so what we do is we have an 87 page CRM configuration SOP removes all of the friction out of their day-to-day and it's built on something called priority views smart priority buckets which is built off of smart views and filters right?   [43:46]  All our sales reps do every day they don't have to worry about who to call when each lead needs what they just go through the priority buckets every single day and it's organized from who's closest to converting into cash, right? Same with the setters, by the way.   [44:03]  Then what we have is our management reports, our pipeline management reports, they are all built to mirror and echo the priority buckets, right? So what we're doing is we reverse engineer revenue leakage. Where is all the place you're losing money? And you have to have reports to manage specifically against that.   [44:23]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Revenue Leakage Reports"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Exemplos de relatórios: lost deals previously forecasted, low activity qualified leads, past due close dates   [44:25]  When I see sales teams management reports, it's ridiculous. It's like this is how much revenue you might make and these are the amount of deals you have open. And they're not looking at the places where you could actually impact revenue.   [44:38]  Here's an example. Well, I want to see a report on lost deals that were previously forecasted. If it was such a hot lead, why didn't they close? Let's look into that. I want to see lost deals with low activity that are qualified. If it was a qualified lead, why'd you call them one time? Right? This is how you're catching revenue leakage.   [44:59]  This is the type of shit that most sales teams don't put into place. I want to see expected close dates past due. You're telling me you're expecting this guy's going to buy a $10,000 offer and the close date was 4 days ago and you haven't reached out.   [45:15]  So, you have to focus your entire system. Closers and setters have priority buckets to know the hottest opportunities to prioritize and the management team has the congruent reports to know exactly where revenue is going to fall through the cracks.   [45:31]  Right now, what I'm going to do here, guys, because of time, and I'll break this down for anyone who wants to talk about it later. I'm going to skip down to the reinvestment part because this is a really big lesson. Jeremy, I'll jump through this.   [45:47]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Supercharging Scale Through Aggressive Reinvestment"   NÚMEROS:  Pilar 3   VISUAL:  Terceiro e último pilar principal da apresentação   [45:49]  So, number three, right, all I was going to do is show you guys a couple more playbooks of what we do to validate some things in sales performance, but again, I'll be here all night and tomorrow. So, number three, last part of this presentation is supercharging scale through aggressive reinvestment.   [46:07]  Now, this is one of my biggest paradigm shifts over - Jeremy, don't shoot me if it's a couple minutes over because this is what I'm so passionate about right here.   [46:18]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Three Critical Questions"   NÚMEROS:  3 perguntas, 50% (impostos), 20-30% (retorno típico de investimentos)   VISUAL:  Perguntas sobre por que queremos dinheiro, para que usamos, o que fazemos quando contas estão pagas   [46:20]  These three questions, right? Let's think about this. Why do we want to make so much money as business owners? Think about this. Okay. Why? Now, what do we use it for? Throw out answers. We don't have time for hand raising. Throw them out. Why do we want to make so much money?   [46:38]  Freedom. Travel.   [46:40]  Okay. Freedom travel. What do we use the money for?   [46:43]  Buy shit.   [46:44]  Nice shit.   [46:45]  Buy shit. Buy shit. What happens when you have all your bills paid? Then what do you do?   [46:51]  Lifestyle.   [46:52]  Okay. Invest.   [46:54]  It always gets there. We buy a bunch of shit. We buy cars. We buy watches. We have our bills paid. Then what? We invest. Why do you want so much freaking money over what you actually need for your lifestyle? Why?   [47:09]  Well, everybody wants to invest. Here's what's crazy about this. And I learned this. I had the most massive epiphany of my entire career by studying private equity in VC.   [47:21]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "The Paradigm Shift"   NÚMEROS:  50% (impostos), 20-30% (retorno pós-distribuição) vs. 100% pré-tax, retornos exponencialmente maiores   VISUAL:  Comparação entre investimento pós-distribuição vs. reinvestimento no negócio   [47:23]  Check this out. I was working my ass off to take as much money out of the company as humanly possible to pay 50% to the IRS and then hope and pray I can find an investment to deploy to hopefully get a 20 to 30% return. That's what we're doing. That's what you're all doing. That's what I was doing, right?   [47:45]  Not if this is true. Everybody's nodding. That's what you're trying to do. You're redeploying it. Well, here's the thing. Private equity. The wealthiest people in the world, they laugh at us. They think they're idiots. This is why they're buying everybody's companies, by the way.   [48:03]  They max out pre-tax investment through their active business. Okay, think about this. It's a paradigm shift. It changed everything for me. All the investment dollars when you do it through your business, it's an expense, right? Can you write off an investment? No, you can't. You'll go to prison. You can't write off investments.   [48:25]  But if it's reinvestment in your business, it's just an expense that goes against revenue. So hold on a second. So you're writing off 100% of your investment pre-tax. You don't pay any taxes on that. And then you're getting exponentially higher returns than you would ever get post distribution.   [48:45]  And you're accelerating value creation and capital appreciation. In other words, you have a much more valuable business.   [48:53]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "ROIC - Return on Invested Capital"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado claramente   VISUAL:  Acrônimo mais importante para crescimento, conceito de alocação de capital   [48:55]  The most important acronym here for growing your business is return on invested capital and growth rate. That is the most important thing. Check this out guys. Like I said earlier, your job as a business owner and a CEO is to be a capital allocator and always reinvest to generate the best return. Period.   [49:18]  So the question you should ask yourself is how do I buy growth? By the way, you won't know the answer to that if you didn't do all the budgeting stuff that I was talking about earlier. We have to always ask how do I buy growth? What has the best return on invested capital?   [49:36]  Now, this is the thing though. Distributions directly cannibalize your ability to grow. You're constantly taking out the number one resource to grow your business. And again, outside of the lifestyle you want, yeah, buy a Rolex, do whatever you want a couple times. Outside of that, you're just looking for a 20 to 30% return in real estate, whatever it might be.   [50:00]  So, we're over-distributing, which is limiting our growth potential. Check this out as an example.   [50:08]  I skipped a couple slides and I have like two more slides, Jeremy, if you're listening and I'll end here.   [50:15]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "ROIC Calculation Example"   NÚMEROS:  $5K (ad spend por cliente), 5 clientes (capacidade), $10K/mês (salário media buyer), $17K (custo de utilização 90 dias), $10K/mês (conta média), 30% (margem), $42K (investimento total), $180K (lucro), 400% (retorno anualizado), 900% (retorno da empresa do palestrante)   VISUAL:  Cálculo detalhado passo a passo do retorno sobre capital investido   [50:17]  So, you want to standardize your reinvestment formula and figure out what is your ROIC? What's your return on invested capital inside your business? This is so important. Let's say that every five grand spent on ads, you could get a new client, right? Talk about an agency model, you get a new client, every five grand you spent on ads.   [50:37]  Let's say your capacity, let's talk about like your biggest bottleneck would be hiring another media buyer, hiring another marketer if you want to rapidly grow. Let's say the capacity is five clients. Every five clients, you need a new media buyer and it takes roughly 90 days to get to max utilization based on their capacity because you can't give them five clients the day that they sign the contract to start, right?   [51:01]  You have to scale up and there's a sales cycle, etc. So, let's say that that means that you pay them 10 grand a month. $17,000 pre-spending on a media buyer over 90 days because the first month you pay them 10 grand, they have no clients. The second month maybe it's five grand, that's 15 grand in utilization cost.   [51:22]  And the third month they're almost at max utilization, maybe there's a couple grand in lack of utilization, right? So it's 17 grand you pre-spent on that. If your average account is 10 grand a month and you have a 30% margin, that means every $42,000 spent in reinvestment generates $180,000 in profit, which is a 400% annualized return.   [51:47]  Like, does that blow you guys' mind the way it does to me? Do you know what I'm saying? We're over-distributing as fast as we can to pay 50 percent and then get a 20% return when all you have to do is find a way to grow your business and you're getting 400% returns.   [52:06]  By the way, mine's 900. We get a 900% return on every dollar invested in our business. Not to mention why? Cuz you're buying cash flow. You're buying your next level of scale. This is how you scale so freaking fast.   [52:22]  Now, how do I know what to invest in? How do I know where to allocate that capital? Because I have a budget. Because I know what my company looks like at scale and I'm trying to collapse the time frame to scale as fast as freaking possible, right?   [52:38]  Let me see where this goes. Who would want to sell their business one day? Yeah, last one. Jeremy, give you a five-minute warning. I'm way past that, but thank you for that.   [52:51]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Business Valuation Fundamentals"   NÚMEROS:  30% (retorno mínimo PE), 400% (retorno anualizado no negócio)   VISUAL:  Conceito de compra de cash flow, estrutura de fundos PE, retornos mínimos   [52:53]  Who would want to sell your business one day? Right. A lot of people raise their hands. Now, when private equity is buying a business, most of us know the basics of this. They're buying cash flow. That's all they're doing. Your business is whatever the cash flow is worth.   [53:10]  Now, the way that these funds work is it's based on what type of returns they can get, right? We have to remember this. They're just investors. They're just trying to get returns. So, they're going to pay you the most that they could pay you. Well, they're going to negotiate a deal, but if it's a competitive bidding auction, they're going to pay the most that they could pay to achieve their minimum returns.   [53:32]  And so, what you need, it's all about growth potential, validated, predictable growth plan, and how well you can demonstrate a predictable return on invested capital. If you can show you get a 400% annualized return in my business, you're going to sell your business for a shitload of money.   [53:52]  This is why venture capitalist guys, private equity, I don't know if you guys dig deep enough, they don't take money out of the business. They do not take distributions. In fact, even in their operating agreements, they don't even talk about cash flow because none of them care. It's all driven around a liquidity event because they're trying to reinvest 100% of it to exit. That's what they're doing, right?   [54:16]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Valuation Formula"   NÚMEROS:  Múltiplo x EBITDA, 12 meses (trailing), 3 anos (financials solicitados)   VISUAL:  Fórmula de avaliação simplificada, importância dos últimos 12 meses   [54:18]  So, the valuation simplified the way that it works. It's a multiple times EBITDA, right? So based on your trailing 12 months or your last 12 months, it's really the same thing. That's how they value your business, right? It's based on the last 12 months times whatever multiple your industry would get.   [54:36]  Now, anyone know why they request the last three years of financials?   [54:41]  Growth rate.   [54:42]  That's it. To see growth rate. They want to see growth rate. They want to analyze return on invested capital. They don't blend all three of the past years to adjust the EBITDA. That's not the way that it works. They're looking at the assumptions that they use for their financial model.   [55:00]  If you guys are not creating hyper growth in your business, you're going to get smacked if you try to sell your business. Here's why. Last slide, Jeremy.   [55:10]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Valuation Impact of Growth Rate"   NÚMEROS:  $1M EBITDA, 4x múltiplo, $4M valor, 25% retorno (sem crescimento), 20% crescimento anual, $2M EBITDA (ano 4), 50% retorno, 2x valor do negócio   VISUAL:  Comparação lado a lado: negócio estagnado vs. negócio com 20% crescimento anual, impacto dramático na avaliação   [55:12]  This is why right here. Valuations and returns. It all comes down to the returns. So, what they do, they're going to look at your growth rate. They're going to look at the return on invested capital. They're going to build it in a budget like I was telling you about earlier. They're going to map it all out.   [55:28]  Now, let's say that you have a million-dollar EBITDA and you get a four times multiple. That's a 25% return, right? Like I was just talking about, it's all about returns. Now, typically, just so you know, private equity, they don't want anything under a 30% return loosely.   [55:45]  But if you take a million in EBITDA, a four times multiple, that's $4 million, the way that that annualizes, it's a 25% return because you get a million back on your 4 million every year. Well, let's say that you have a 20% growth rate year-over-year instead of flatlined, right?   [56:04]  That would end up being a $2 million EBITDA against 4 million. That's a 50% return. Did you follow what I did there? Cuz if you take 20% and you if you take a million and you times it by 20% year-over-year for four years, you're going to end up with roughly $2 million.   [56:23]  So now when they're actually modeling it out, they're saying this is the actual cash flow we're buying and there's not a lot of risk because they've demonstrated that growth rate. That's a 50% return. They'll literally pay double the business, right?   [56:38]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Final Takeaway"   NÚMEROS:  Não especificado   VISUAL:  Mensagem final sobre ser CEO vs. apenas vendedor   [56:40]  So I guess the moral of the story is this and I'll end here. I love sales. I love scaling sales operation. But in this theme that Jeremy's talking about with thinking bigger, like it's not about sales, right? You have to get good sales people. Like we all know that that's the obvious thing, but it's about the way that you're building your business.   [57:02]  I challenge you to become a good CEO and always be looking for how do I buy growth, right? Figure out your growth rate. Reinvest as much as you possibly can because it's the reason most of the time businesses aren't growing. They're just flatlined, but it's because you're taking - you're sucking all the resources out of the business every month.   [57:24]  So anyways guys, there's a lot of slides I skipped. I'd love to talk to you guys deeper if there's anything specific here that was interesting to you. But really appreciate it. We'll go ahead and bring up Ryan now.     📊 RESUMO EXECUTIVO   NÚMEROS PRINCIPAIS: 12 anos de sobriedade Orçamentos de 12 meses (não 3 anos) 70-80% margem ideal em unit economics 20-30% CAC recomendado 50% margem bruta resultante 30% margem líquida após OPEX 4-5 sales reps contratados durante um voo 87 páginas de SOP de CRM 72 horas para implementação de CRM 8 calls por dia por vendedor 22 dias úteis por mês 176 deals abertos por mês por rep 48 calls/mês (exemplo de capacidade de coach) 160 calls (capacidade de vendedor) 50% impostos sobre distribuições 20-30% retorno típico de investimentos externos 400% retorno anualizado em reinvestimento no negócio (exemplo) 900% retorno da empresa do palestrante $5K ad spend por cliente (exemplo) $10K/mês conta média (exemplo) $17K custo de utilização 90 dias (exemplo) $42K investimento total (exemplo) $180K lucro gerado (exemplo) 3-6x EBITDA múltiplo realista 30% retorno mínimo PE $1M EBITDA exemplo 4x múltiplo exemplo $4M valor de empresa 20% crescimento anual $2M EBITDA ano 4 50% retorno com crescimento 2x valor do negócio com crescimento   ESTRATÉGIAS E SISTEMAS: Reverse Business Planning (começar pelo fim desejado) Crystal Ball Operators (claridade, certeza, intenção) Orçamento de 12 meses Operating Model (Rolling Forecast) 90-Day Cash Flow Analyzer Unit Economics como base Revenue Drivers e Growth Assumptions Capacity Assumptions Comp Planning e Hiring Schedules Expense Assumptions Revenue Forecast com modelo específico Full P&L Forecast Capital Structure (reservas vs. reinvestimento) Returns and Exit Analysis Scenario Modeling constante FQC Report (Forecast, Quota, Commitment) Sophisticated Lead Scoring Model CRM Dispositions (campo aberto forçado) Validation Sequence (4 etapas) Priority Buckets System Revenue Leakage Prevention Management Reports espelhando Priority Buckets Predictable Talent Acquisition (tratado como customer acquisition) Passive Candidate Outreach para management 87-page CRM Configuration SOP Build-Measure-Learn Loops Validated Learning PMF x Distribution Blitzscaling Corporate Development Aggressive Reinvestment Strategy ROIC Focus (Return on Invested Capital) Pre-tax Investment Maximization   ESTRUTURA: Três pilares principais: Reverse Business Planning & Financial Fluency Operational Execution Aggressive Reinvestment 9 componentes de orçamento 4 etapas de Validation Sequence 2 pré-requisitos para escalar 3 perguntas críticas sobre dinheiro Org Chart planejado por nível de receita Director of Talent Acquisition Director of Sales Operations Hiring funnels com VSSLs Sales management via passive recruiting CRM como core value engine   DADOS FINANCEIROS: Reserva de 3-6 meses recomendada Distribuição mínima necessária definida Resto para reinvestimento Golden Formula: Lead Flow x Sales Performance = Revenue Única forma de escalar: aumentar ad spend + contratar reps Investimento pós-distribuição: paga 50% impostos + espera 20-30% retorno Investimento pré-tax no negócio: 100% dedutível + retornos exponenciais Exemplo ROIC: $42K investimento → $180K lucro = 400% retorno Empresa do palestrante: 900% ROIC Valuation: Múltiplo x EBITDA trailing 12 meses Growth rate = 2x valor do negócio (exemplo 20% YoY) PE não toma distribuições - foco em liquidity event Todos os recursos reinvestidos até exit   DURAÇÃO:  ~57 minutos  FORMATO:  Apresentação em mastermind de marketing digital sobre scaling de operações de vendas e planejamento financeiro estratégico
