"Thanks for the kind intro. Uh I just want to start out by thanking Jeremy because uh you know this guy took a chance on me years ago."
[00:08]
"Uh I just shared this with him earlier. A lot of people don't know this, but uh I'm 42 years old today. I didn't step into entrepreneurship until I was 38 years old."
[00:18]
"So think about that. Less than four years ago, I was working for somebody. And uh right after that happened, I started multiple companies."
[00:27]
"Uh I met Jeremy and this dude flew halfway around the world to Angilla to speak at an event for me. So it's an honor and a privilege to be here uh for you, man."
[00:38]
"So um thanks for having me and thanks to you guys for having me. So what I thought I'd do today is to tell you guys a story because I've got multiple businesses."
[00:48]
"My main business is a construction company. Um we do asphalt and concrete around the United States. So, in all 50 states in Puerto Rico."
[00:58]
"Um we've been begged to go to Canada. We haven't taken that step yet because it's a pain in the ass from an exchange standpoint."
[01:06]
"Um but I started multiple businesses at the same time and then later on uh due to influence, so building online presence and influence, I ended up as a partner in this digital marketing company."
[01:19]
"So, I'm I'm playing in your world. And we we sold digital marketing to hundreds of contractors. We now have over a thousand clients."
[01:28]
"Um, but I I thought I'd tell you the story of how we built and exited a company for quite a bit of money in in just around 18 months, right?"
[01:38]
"So, uh, that company is called Lead Revenue. Uh, Jason is familiar with it. Jason does some work for us."
[01:46]
"Um, he's a great example of how that works. This guy did an excellent job of not just building a relationship with me, but showing the persistence without being annoying of being able to build a relationship."
[01:59]
"And and that takes uh it takes skill. It takes having grace. It takes uh confidence, right? Self-confidence to be able to hang around and let that happen."
[02:10]
"And so that is that's kind of what I had that led me to this scenario of being part of this company, right? So I had two other companies uh and I actually started doing business with lead revenue as a client."
[02:24]
"Uh, I just, you know, went to speak at an event much like this one that Brett Sutherland, my partner in this company, uh, was a speaker at."
[02:33]
"Just a quick side story, the night before I went to speak at that event, I was literally throwing up off the side of my bed and my wife said, 'Uh, you need to call and cancel.'"
[02:43]
"And I said, 'Absolutely fucking not. I will be there because that dude has exited multiple businesses for nine figures each and I need to meet him.'"
[02:54]
"Uh, and today that's a a a story for you guys to remember. Today, that guy is my business partner. So, think about that. Take the chance, right? Show up no matter what."
[03:06]
"Um, so I met Brett. He pitched me on doing my digital marketing for my construction company. That experience went incredible."
[03:15]
"And so ultimately, um, I became a a a customer of theirs. And then I coach I also have a coaching company called Top Contractor School."
[03:24]
"I coach about 400 contractors around the world um on how to scale and market and lead their businesses a little bit better."
[03:33]
"And so I started referring clients over to lead revenue, right? And uh sent over probably six or seven deals the first month."
[03:42]
"Uh Brett calls me on the phone and he says, 'Hey man, uh we got to get you set up on an agent agreement.' And I said, 'Well, what's an agent agreement?'"
[03:51]
"He said, 'Well, we pay you for referring these people to us.' And I said, 'Well, I didn't send them to you cuz I'm getting paid, right?'"
[04:00]
"I just sent them to you because you did a great job on on my stuff and so I want to send you business and I want to help the people that that are important to me."
[04:10]
"And he said, 'Well, if you don't want the $23,000 that I have sitting here for you, then uh no problem.' I said, 'Well, it's not like that, man. Hold on a second. We can figure this out.'"

[04:24]
"So, uh long story short, I became an agent and just was referring deals over. Uh did a great job at doing that."
[04:32]
"Just just influence allowed people the transfer of trust, right? allowed me to become an important part of their uh system and I became a board member for lead revenue."
[04:43]
"So now I was an advisory board, board of directors member and uh that unlocked all kinds of other opportunities, right? Other people that I got to meet."
[04:53]
"Uh but that entire business model ultimately got launched through what I'll refer to as influencer marketing, right?"
[05:01]
"So if you look at how do you how do you launch a company? So, how many of you guys in this room struggle with getting enough attention to your own companies, getting more customers, getting more opportunities, right?"
[05:14]
"I always find it ironic that uh when you talk to marketers, the biggest trouble that they have is marketing, right? Ironic, but it's true."
[05:23]
"And it's true in our company, right? So, when I stepped in, um that is what I have always done. I've been in sales my whole life."
[05:32]
"And so doing that for this company was just second nature to me. Business development is natural, right?"
[05:38]
"So if you guys are struggling in that regard, I would highly recommend that you start to look for those."
[05:44]
"So in in this case, uh we went into the construction vertical because that was something that I had a warm audience in, right?"

"And very quickly went from a brand new company to 6 months later having hundreds of contractors, right, as as clients."
[06:03]
"Then word of mouth, processes, procedures, doing things the right way and getting people results obviously leads to that multiplying."
[06:12]
"And so, um, how many of you guys do you think could benefit if you chose if you had the right influencer and you could get into a space, a space that maybe you're already doing business in?"
[06:24]
"Just shout out an example. Somebody's doing business in a vertical that, you know, maybe if you had an influencer, you could you could multiply that vertical. Anybody have an example of it?"
[06:35]
"Oh any other example other than branded? Because that would be an easy one. Who who is doing business in a vertical right now that you would like to do more business in? What's the vertical?"
[06:46]
"I'm in the pre-IPO space. Pre-IPO. And so who who are the influencers online in that space?"
[06:54]
"No one. People talk about stocks and stuff. Impossible. There has to be somebody. Maybe. Not even."
[07:02]
"So, who's on television doing it? No, he doesn't even do. I'm not even kidding. I don't think there's anybody to be honest."
[07:10]
"Then it's you, right? If you can't figure out who it is, it's likely you, right? Or somebody that you know or somebody that's doing this, somebody that's talking about."
[07:21]
"You wouldn't be selling marketing or selling a package to something that didn't exist, right? So, somebody is influencing that, right?"
[07:29]
"If you think about that in any vertical like construction's a good a good example like there's me there's Lee Hale there's all kinds of guys right that uh when people told me hey man you should be more present on social media."
[07:42]
"When I started my construction company I'm like who the hell is going to listen to somebody talk about construction well in all reality it's not about just talking about construction right."
[07:53]
"It's about building an audience uh telling your story becoming what I call evangelical about your cause that allows people to be able to connect to you, right?"
[08:05]
"So, when you put yourself out there and you talk about something every single day over and over and over again, whether that's your personal values, what you stand for, whatever vertical you're part of."
[08:17]
"People become inquisitive about who it is that you actually are, right? Everybody knows Brandon for what he is online, but the people that really follow him know a lot more than just what the Instagram headlines say."
[08:30]
"True. Yeah, I would hope so. Yeah. And so when you think about that, how does that look within your business?"
[08:38]
"If you find one of these influencers and and your trust for your business is automatically turned on because of their trust, right?"
[08:47]
"Do you think if Brandon was going to endorse a business or I was going to endorse a business or Jeremy was going to endorse a business with the level of trust that we've built with followers."
[08:57]
"What is the chance that we would do that with someone that's not trustworthy? So, the speed of trust increases, right?"

"His dad was a car dealer. That was the business that he spent all his life in, right? So, everyone knew him in automotive, but he had nowhere to turn, right?"
[09:30]
"No other industry that he could go into easy. Um, and so there was me and another person that was part of that company who's no longer part of the company that really got it off the ground from an influence standpoint."
[09:43]
"And started to make inroads into that. So I I challenge you guys to think about that. Who is that for each of your businesses?"
[09:51]
"Who is that one person that's out there that you could build a relationship with? I met Brett and Brett met me by chance."
[10:00]
"But who is that in your life that could turn the switch and build that company to that massive of an exit in a short period of time?"
[10:09]
"So when you think about how that works, you have influencer-driven marketing, right? And that's that's step one."
[10:16]
"How do you actually incent those people? So I was talking to a couple of the guys earlier and and so to walk you guys through this process, I'm going to give you the whole playbook of exactly how we did it here."

"Um when we started the company, we needed to incent people at a high level, right? So we took the monthly recurring revenue of uh and to back up a second."
[10:40]
"We do website, social media posting, Google my business optimization and paid search, right?"
[10:47]
"So whatever that client was paying monthly, we would pay the agent, which at the beginning was me and then a lot of other people came behind that."
[10:56]
"We would pay them two times the monthly recurring revenue of that contract right up front as soon as they signed the deal."
[11:04]
"And then we would wait to get paid, right? So it would take us a couple of months to recover that money."
[11:10]
"So you do in order to execute that, you do have to have a lot of funds up front. Not saying you have to necessarily do it that way, but that is that's the way that we did it."
[11:20]
"You could do one times monthly MRR, right? But when we did that, it got people really interested."
[11:27]
"So, you can imagine if somebody's signing a $1,500 a month contract, it's not really a whole lot of money, but to the person that's selling it, all they're doing is referring that business in and they're making three grand right off the bat, right?"

"12-month contract, so it guarantees, you know, cash on the back end for us. But that's how we started."
[11:51]
"As we started to get into it, we needed a little less of that because we had an agent network and we flipped that um compensation plan over to one month with then a monthly residual on the back end of that, right?"
[12:05]
"So, we would it was less upfront and a little bit more to keep the agents interested in maintaining that client."
[12:13]
"Um, and then as we got it, man, we had so many agents that there was one agent that created a sub agent program."

[12:37]
"So, he was getting paid this. He was paying these people this. And the entire process of unloading these sub agents was automated."
[12:46]
"He only talked to the people that went through three or four steps to actually qualify themselves and prove that they weren't full of shit right?"
[12:54]
"So, when you think about how quickly that builds, right? I mean, we're talking about signing probably 30 clients a month on a brand new company. That's a lot of money, right?"

[13:22]
"And for the next three months it's multiple six figures every single month. How many of you could use explosive growth like that?"
[13:30]
"Then the question is how do you support it? Right? So, you find somebody that's going to be the evangelist for your company."
[13:38]
"Jason and I were talking about this. If you have someone that you can paint the vision to, like when I met with Brett the first time, the vision was crystal clear, like what it was going to look like."
[13:50]
"To Jeremy's point, we were building this company with the intention of exiting it. There was no there was no doubt about it that that's what we were doing, right?"
[14:00]
"So, I bought into that because that's what I do, right? I like to build businesses and I'm way better at building them. I get bored when I have to run them for long periods of time, right?"
[14:11]
"It's just not my thing. I'm way better at designing them and getting them off the ground."
[14:16]
"So, when you think about what that looks like from a process and procedure standpoint to be able to support it, you get the evangelist out here preaching, right? Talking to everybody about what it is."
[14:28]
"But the only way that that works is on the back end if the processes, procedures, the foundational pieces are all lined out perfectly."
[14:37]
"So what does that look like in your business? Could your business support that today?"

[15:04]
"But we could plan to say we're going to build this so that we can do 50,000 in monthly recurring revenue and be able to process all that."
[15:13]
"So what does that look like? How many people do we need? How many customer service reps? How many performance managers? How many people do we need running ads?"
[15:23]
"What does each category within the business look like? And then when do we need to hire these folks?"
[15:29]

"We know exactly how many accounts each person can manage. We know exactly how many ads one person can run. We know exactly every single category. It's well defined."
[16:02]
"Part of that is because Brett has been through this before, right? So the it's repeating the process over and over again."

[16:47]
"Well, you have to get super clear on what the vision is. Jeremy said it. If you start out not knowing what you want to do."
[16:55]
"And I believe there's there's two different types of approaches to these types of businesses, and neither one is right or wrong."
[17:02]
"But there is a lifestyle element like I'm going to I'm going to own and operate this business, and this is how I want to build it, and I just want to build it and keep it, right?"

"So, for those of you that don't know, these types of businesses, if you have 12-month contracts, extended contracts, they look at uh digital marketing businesses, monthly recurring revenue businesses as SAS businesses, so software as a service, right?"
[17:47]
"And so those businesses exit for massive multiples on EBITDA and growth rate propels that higher."
[17:55]
"So, that's one of the things high growth rate is what they're looking for. So, it's not just get it to, you know, 5 million, 10 million in annual revenue and let it sit."
[18:06]
"It's you want to be adding significant amounts of money every month. So, when I throw out numbers like a hundred thousand in monthly recurring revenue, that's $1.2 million in annual revenue being added every month."

"So high growth rate is one of the things that they're looking at strong EBITDA which it's very difficult not to have strong EBITDA in this business right it's just a very high margin business."
[18:41]
"But every dollar matters right when you start looking at this at scale it gets easier to be good at EBITDA because it's hard to literally if you get 3.6 million in annual recurring revenue a month. It's hard to spend it all right."
[18:56]
"It's hard to even keep up with hiring at that rate. But strong EBITDA uh the most important and if you don't get everything right on the front end, this is where everything can come off the rails."
[19:08]

"And there were a lot of back and forth things that they had to do to kind of clarify financials right to make sure that everything was in line."

"That shit doesn't fly with private equity. They will uh they will literally get under the hood of every single detail."
[21:17]
"To give you an idea, they read every single contract. My man in the back knows he's shaking his head cuz he's probably been through it, right?"
[21:25]
"Like every contract they read and they will ask you questions. I mean, I'm talking any contract."
[21:31]
"There was one that came across that was like $150 or $200 a month that we signed in the beginning of the company that they were questioning."
[21:39]
"I was like, 'Holy shit man. They really do read every single one of these things, right?'"
[21:44]
"Um and and last but not least, the right people. Who is on your staff and what is the quality of those people?"
[21:52]
"Uh they will do background checks on every single person. When this was happening, they literally followed me on social media for an extended period of time to see what I was speaking about."
[22:03]
"Was it controversial? was it, you know, within the lines of what they could represent. Very important things, right?"
[22:11]
"When you think about that, um, all of those things combine into a very massive pile of cash on the back end."

"So, every dollar in monthly recurring revenue on a 12-month contract that we add right now, it adds $50 to $80 in enterprise value for the company."
[22:38]
"I'll break that down for you. Every $100,000 in monthly recurring revenue that we add right now is $8 million in value added to the exit of the company."
[22:49]
"Somewhere from 5 to 8 million depending on growth rate and all the other things that I just mentioned. So on average it's probably a 16 multiplier on exit."

"Uh and nobody trusts digital marketers. So, like I knew I knew already how to deal with clients and I knew that, you know, to be able to secure these clients and to be able to deliver at this level, um, you have to have a great customer experience."
[24:26]
"And so, uh, my business partner Brett Sutherland, for those of you, you know him. I mean, the guy is, um, you know, has a very high net worth already."
[24:36]
"Uh, is about to exit another company for a significant amount of money. You call him at 5:00 in the morning, he'll answer on the second ring. You call him at 10 o'clock at night, he'll answer on the first ring."
[24:48]
"Uh he's the first person I talk to almost every morning and he's the last person I talk to at night."
[24:54]
"Um and it is that is his passion, right? He he is passionate about creating the right experience and getting results."
[25:03]
"Does that mean we're perfect? Absolutely not, man. I've seen I've seen us build the exact same platform, the exact same content, the exact same delivery."
[25:13]
"And the results that you get in Charlotte, North Carolina versus Chicago, Illinois are completely different."
[25:19]
"So, you're not going to satisfy. That's why churn is a normal thing, right? You're not going to satisfy 100% of the customers."
[25:27]
"When you can't get it right, you have to handle that situation properly, too, right? So that it doesn't snowball, you don't get bad reviews, things like that."
[25:36]
"I can tell you this, there have been a handful of customers in in two years that have been like genuinely upset with us."
[25:44]
"Other than that, it comes down to their monthly experience. Like they get a call and an email from their performance manager."
[25:52]
"Uh they get the opportunity to talk to us and review everything that's going on once a month. They get a report with their actual results with no bullshit right?"
[26:03]
"Because this is what digital marketers do. They create their own reports and make it look a certain way, but the people aren't getting results, right?"
[26:12]
"We onboard people every single day. They get a customized report from their digital marketing agency."
[26:18]
"And the customized report is similar to what the government tells us about uh finances and money and uh medical reports and all those kinds of things."
[26:27]
"It's like it's manipulated to make them look good, right? And so you have to be honest and you have to have something that you are working consistently to actually get these people results."
[26:39]
"And when you do that, you're just not going to have a lot of churn because quite frankly, just like being a good contractor, there's not a lot of them out there. So people don't want to leave you."
[26:49]
"So if you're experiencing high churn, for example, in your business, um, look at what you're doing, right?"
[26:56]
"Look at is the communication good enough? Is the customer experience good enough? Is the process of onboarding them on the front end good enough?"
[27:05]
"Uh, when I had my website built, right out of the gate, people would ask me, 'What was it like?' And I literally described it like this."
[27:13]
"I said, 'It was like buying a website from Chick-fil-A. It was the easiest and fastest and simplest and least amount of pain I've ever been through.'"

[27:36]
"Prepare to do it all yourself. If they give you anything, it's a bonus. But customer experience is everything. You have to be different."
[27:45]
"You know, everybody that's been in sales has talked about differentiation. What is differentiation?"
[27:51]
"In the construction industry, people will tell you they have the best equipment or they have the best employees with the most experience. That's not differentiation."
[28:00]
"I can buy that. If you can buy it, it's not differentiation. It has to be something unique that can't be duplicated easily. It's about experience."
[28:11]
"You guys are marketers. What makes people buy? There's two things that unlock people to be able to buy stuff. A logical side of the decision and an emotional side of it."
[28:22]
"If you cannot unlock emotion, people have no loyalty to you. Right. Just like any other business."
[28:30]
"What is it that makes them go to Chick-fil-A every time? What is it that makes people go to Chick-fil-A?"
[28:36]
"It's fast. It's a great experience. The food's consistent, right? Can it be duplicated?"

[29:02]
"How do you create that as a digital marketer? Here's what I believe the curse of digital marketing is."
[29:09]
"It's a very profitable business and it's pretty easy to get enough money to be comfortable. Only the best of the best deliver at the highest level."
[29:19]
"And they don't get seduced by success. You get a little bit of money in your pocket and you say, 'Man, I'm making 30, 40, 50 grand a month.'"
[29:28]
"If that's how you feel, if you get seduced by success, you'll never get multiple nine figure exit because that's what it takes."
[29:37]
"Because it's not about the money for the people that are doing that. Once you get enough money that you can live forever, you better you better not get seduced by success."
[29:48]
"Or you will find yourself in all kinds of troubles, not just in business but personally as well."
[29:54]
"So build trust with your customers. Uh have somebody that is the evangelist. Throw out some examples of evangelists that you know of."
[30:03]
"Who comes to mind? An evangelist. Somebody that preaches about their cause."
[30:09]
"Jesus. Jesus. Martin Luther King. Love him or hate him. Donald Trump. Mark Zuckerberg. Oprah Winfrey."

[30:44]
"And don't try to force yourself into it, right? I was telling Jason earlier, I'm like, you can't you can't make yourself an incredible salesperson. You can't."
[30:55]
"You can over time, right? You can get better at it, but if that's not you, don't try to fit yourself into that spot. Try to find that person."
[31:04]
"But figure out who that is. Get that evangelical person, that person that just has a natural knack for people to listen to them. We all know them. You probably advertise for them."
[31:16]
"Think about it. Those people who are out there, when you find that person, that person will help you leverage the brand. They will also help you expand the messaging."
[31:27]
"I was back in the back of the room this morning texting with Brett. We've signed up so many people in the paving space that it's getting more difficult to get their attention, right?"
[31:38]
"Because the immediate audience, Jeremy and I were talking about this in the kitchen, the immediate audience is almost dry, right?"
[31:46]
"Like those people who are actively watching what we're doing all the time. So, we're talking about recrafting the messaging because now we are the choice in digital for paving contractors."
[31:58]
"We're not trying to make it anymore. We have most of them. We have hundreds and hundreds of paving contractors."
[32:05]
"So, evolving the message, that person will help you evolve the message. They'll know the temperature of the market and how to change it and help you continue to grow, never to face those roadblocks."

"So, now we have two people in roofing influencing, right? Another person in real estate. And so we're exploding in these markets."
[32:36]
"I mean, I'm talking again signing up 20, 30, 60 clients a month in one vertical from an influencer, from somebody that can get people on a webinar."
[32:47]
"Mass demo, set up a portal where people can put their own name, their own email address, and their company name, and it autogenerates a contract to them for a flat rate."
[32:58]
"That's scalability, right? You're not going to do that in the beginning because it wouldn't work very well, right? It's a more personal touch."
[33:06]
"You're paying more on the back end and then it evolves, right? What's that?"
[33:12]
"Yeah. I don't want to drill this too much, but I just in co I was doing a gym in this gym and I moved into contracting space. I fucking hated it."
[33:22]
"Like the worst clients I've ever worked with in my life. I get just fucking amazed when you're saying that like you're holding underneath the 5% churn."
[33:31]
"How the fuck are you like not getting chargebacks with these guys too? How are you not like a lot of these guys like they get paid 60 gs home month they'll go drive for you know."
[33:42]
"It's who you're selling it's also why the influencer is important think about this I know who every fucking contractor is right you know who they are right."
[33:54]
"And so it's it's getting you're taking something you know nothing about and you're getting granular through someone else's vehicle that does know about."
[34:05]
"By the way, Brett said to me last week, 'I don't understand why everybody doesn't run this model.' I said, 'Two reasons, man. Number one, nobody's really thought of it.'"
[34:16]
"Number two, a lot of people don't have 200, 300 grand to put up in commissions before they get any money.'"
[34:24]
"How do you how do you go find the these people? How do you suggest those relationships?"
[34:31]
"Networking. Yeah, it's all networking. It's asking people."
[34:36]
"You're incentivizing those people on what like the 1500 times do you?"
[34:42]
"Yeah. Like give you an idea, dude. Like when I met Brett and Brett did this agent agreement with me, I made, you know, couple hundred thousand dollars literally sending a text to Brett saying."
[34:54]
"'Brett, meet Jeremy Haynes. Jeremy works for XYZ Contracting and he's interested in our services. Can you set up I'll I'll let you guys take it from here to set up a demo.'"

"It's pretty easy once you you just you have to be careful to find the right influencers though because there are influencers out there that will do it just for the money."
[35:25]
"They have to have values, right? They have to be honest. They can't be somebody that's just going to send you anybody and everybody."
[35:33]
"It's just like hiring an employee, but it's it should be easier, right? You can tell a lot from people online."
[35:40]
"Um, what's your take on having a a more scaled up like a more horizontally scaled agency like this? Um, and having like revshare agreements with your clients."
[35:51]
"Um, revshare is not purchasable by private equity."
[35:56]
"What if you had what if you had the $1,500 per month and a rev? Uh, don't know about that possibly."
[36:04]
"But yeah, I I threw that past Brett because I knew that that's how a lot of you guys did it and he he told me it's not they won't touch it because it's too it's too fluctuating."
[36:15]
"But to your point, yeah, if it was if it was contracted for X, but you probably wouldn't get anything from them on the upside of it, right, on the multiple because it's not guaranteed, right? It could go away tomorrow."
[36:28]
"Yep. What's that? Yeah. Yeah. If you guys have whatever questions you have."
[36:35]
"Um, how do these PE companies like grow from there?"
[36:40]
"I mean, what honestly it's harder uh they buy those because it's easier to uh they have a staff uh to simplify."
[36:49]
"They have a staff of people that they will rotate around into these companies that help run them."
[36:56]
"Uh if you put good operators behind any company that's already got momentum, it's naturally going to grow."
[37:03]
"Um it's a it's a great example like when we bring on these influencers now who are, you know, joining our advisory board."
[37:11]
"Um basically that's one of the things we say to them is after this exit, the PE company could pick you up and take you to the next company."

[37:42]
"Um, I don't think I will do that, but if if I wanted to, those are relationships that you build."
[37:48]
"And then when you run the company again, you get a salary and all that stuff, but then you get a couple points of equity in every deal to take it over, run it for the period of time that they want to run it to grow it, and then they flip it out again."
[38:02]
"Anybody else have questions?"
[38:05]
"What originally gave you this idea? You presented Brett with?"
[38:10]
"So he he had created the company. So he had already started the company. Um, when I became a customer, because of my influence in construction, I knew this was an open space, right?"
[38:24]
"I knew that there was nobody of this experience, uh, of this ability to perform."
[38:30]
"Like, you know, Brett's knowledge, I joke around, I say Brett knows more about Google than Google."
[38:37]
"Um, and it's it's for real. He's been doing it since uh to take a step back, he had Beach Honda right here in uh in North Miami, I think it is."
[38:48]
"And he canceled all traditional advertising. Anybody that knows anything about automotive, they spend hundreds of thousands of dollars a month in some cases advertising."

"He eventually got Beach Honda from a bottom uh bottom 25 dealership to a top 25 dealership in the country within Honda and then sold that and kept the digital part."
[39:28]
"And he started Fusion Zone Automotive. He acquired Fusion Zone and made it Fusion Zone Automotive, grew that to 2500 dealers."
[39:37]
"So when I talked to him, I just knew that, you know, this was a huge gap in the contracting space."
[39:44]
"And so that's why I started funneling customers to him and it was you know just instant. It was very clear to him on the number of people that were saying yes that this was a massive opportunity. Right."
[39:57]
"So in the model of lead generation agencies when they work with local clients like I would say the shitty ones are the ones that are having like 45 to 60 day like retention rates."
[40:09]
"But like a lot of the ones that are quote unquote good at least from probably a couple hundred. It seems like somewhere between two to six and a half months."
[40:18]
"The ones that rock are going to stick with you for years. But then you got guys like even though it's a good client, you can do everything right, it just seems like it's gone like six months."
[40:28]
"From your experience working in the space, um I don't know if you have specific guess what are what are local generation agencies doing wrong to have such a short lifespan."
[40:39]
"Um I think people aren't doing the right things to be honest with you. Like you know we have we also have uh a double your leads guarantee."

"So we'll take, you know, whatever leads they're getting from their website right now. So we get, you know, whatever email address those leads are being delivered to, we get them to carbon copy our email for the month that it takes us to build their website."
[41:05]
"We get an idea of how many leads were coming in through that and we guarantee double their leads or they don't pay."
[41:12]
"So I believe that it's it's literally just a performance issue. Like I I think to be honest with you and transparent, I think most digital marketing companies are too small."
[41:23]
"Uh, so they can't keep up, you know, as they grow, just like again comparing it to construction. They grow and they start to have trouble and they can't keep up because it's underfunded."
[41:35]
"Um, so I think I think that's really the issue is like, you know, signing up too many people too quick and not having the scalable processes and spending too much of the profit. Um, not being able to keep up."
[41:48]
"They just don't do a good job of product and stuff become fucking. Yep."
[41:53]
"Okay. I don't think it's any more complicated than that. Like they just don't perform."
[41:59]
"I mean, I could show you hundreds of Google My Business profiles that have next to no activity and we take them over and it multiplies by five."
[42:08]
"So, on the agent model, essentially, you're losing money at the beginning by paying the commissions."
[42:15]
"Yeah. You're losing cash. Okay. So, you're not losing money because you have a contract value, right?"
[42:22]
"Yeah. All the contracts are 12 months. Nothing shorter than that. Yes. And they're all locked in for 12 months. Yes."
[42:30]
"Now, automotive, that's kind of different. Like, you know, there's a company over there that kind of changed everything, so it's more month-to-month, but they're a lot more stable of an industry as well."
[42:41]
"So, it's easier to operate there. They're not going to move their website and leave two months later. It's just too big of a task."
[42:49]
"That double your leads guarantee, obviously, it's going to uh be pertinent to each industry. It's going to be different, but for your guys, are you saying double your leads in that first month of working with you?"
[43:01]
"Uh, I believe that I think there's wording of that. It's either 60 or 90 days like you know to give us time but then we refund all the money if we don't do it."
[43:11]
"Yeah. 5% for the users. Mhm. Um no it would still be considered churn."
[43:19]
"Yeah. Whether we refund them or not it's still considered churn. We just I mean in all honesty we don't lose a lot of customers."
[43:27]
"So and it comes down to uh Jason's on the inside so you can ask him some questions too. It's it is literally man we are maniacal about service."
[43:37]
"Did you just eat the chargeback case to the sent to the agent if you lost the so they get charged back technically right so it you know it would go against future uh commissions."
[43:48]
"But in a lot of cases cuz agents are 1099 so if they get too many chargebacks they would you would eat that money but it doesn't happen that often."
[43:57]
"Do you ever do you ever cap the agents on how much they."
[44:01]
"Absolutely not. No. Terrible idea to ever cap a salesperson."
[44:06]
"All right, guys. Let's give it up for Brian."
[44:09]
"Thanks, guys. Appreciate it."
