17 - Day 17.mp4
You might, in real time, have a client that you hit up that might not want to talk to you about certain things, that might tell you things like, 'Hey, you know, I don't know if I want to give you that data or, you know, I don't want to talk to you about my revenue numbers or I don't want to.' necessarily have you talk to me about my own social data and confirm whether it is or isn't true. You know, you might have some people like that yet those people aren't necessarily bad deals or weird. You know, your ability to have a higher sophistication to your communication is your ability to close those types of deals. Now you're going to have the opportunity to be equipped with two different legal agreements.
Okay. Number one, Your NDA, standard NDA, non-disclosure agreement. If somebody feels uncomfortable giving you any kind of information, download the non-disclosure agreement. Your NDA, if you put this, for example, to DocuSign, really easy. objection to overcome if you're on the phone and somebody doesn't want to give you any kind of data. Also, you could have this in your handy dandy book bag. When you show up to a meeting, if you're in person, you could slide across the table and say, 'Hey, no, I understand.' Listen, you're a business owner. Owner, you have proprietary data. I don't necessarily want to push you on something that you don't want to talk to me about. So I brought an NDA along to represent that I'm not going to disclose anything.
If you have an NDA on file with your organization, I'd be happy to look at it and sign it as well. Whatever makes you feel comfortable, in order for us to move along together today. In DocuSign, it's very simple. You go through it. Nothing inside of the NDA— anything you have to change. There's just open areas where you can type in your company, your addresses. Things are very clear within the NDA. This is more of a template. This is in a Word doc, right? You have an opportunity to go down this now. It's day 17, you might be closing some deals. Some deals happen right away, some deals happen a little longer now. In this agreement, you'll see it's branded for my organization. This is one of the assets that I give you guys.
The opportunity to download what you're going to want to do here: Swap out your branding. It's very easy in Word just to simply change the universal color for each one of the headers. Then go through, actually read it, and see where it says. What type of money? Understand where the addresses are. Understand where to list your payment types. You'll see, within this entire agreement, there's headers and footers for my organization. Everything, because this is a Word document, is editable. So you have an opportunity to go in here. It's a simple header, simple footer, all removable, one image, and with one change. You can change it all in this entire agreement. It's pretty simple. Change the name of the client, change the price, change the time of your agreement itself, and just go through and list your services.
There's a copy and paste of the services that we have and then explanations of each one. So in real time, when you're standard agreement here, you have an opportunity to understand that, whenever you're going to close a deal, you don't ever want to take money. You want to define what it is you're going to do. You want to explain in detail the specifics of when, what, and how everything's going to be done. You want to go into detail. You can look up what's called an SOW. You want to Google SOW business defense. Fine. But all that aside, it is day 17. You need to go hit your 100. Now you're covered legally. I'm going to talk to you tomorrow.
We're going to go over creative follow-up videos that you're going to be able to use because you should be gathering some cell phones. You should have some emails. You may have some social media handles for all these different people that you're communicating with. If you do not, be prepared for tomorrow by coming prepared with a list, all the cells, all the names of the cell phones. Hopefully, you have a backup of all their different social medias, preferably Facebook, so you can drop some videos to them. And I want to show you. How are you going to be able to do a lot with that phone in your pocket?
