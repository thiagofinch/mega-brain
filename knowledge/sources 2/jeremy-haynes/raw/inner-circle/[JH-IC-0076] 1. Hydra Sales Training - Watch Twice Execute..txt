Transcrição Completa: Hydra Sales Training - Watch Twice Execute
[00:00] The Hydra is a lead gen strategy. It's currently the best lead gen strategy in my opinion that I'm seeing. For the last like three years, we've done scheduled call funnels for our high ticket clients. We've done it for high ticket ecom stores and across the board it works really well.
[00:15] The issue is the show rate on call funnels now has really tanked over the last couple years. As I talked about last mastermind, and this is still an inner circle exclusive in terms of me teaching it. I haven't taught it to anybody else yet.

[00:35] Long story short, the Hydra leverages lead forms inside of the ad platforms. Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok in particular. You can also do it on LinkedIn or any other ad channel that has lead forms associated with it.
[00:50] The biggest issue that the Hydra revealed is that sales people fucking suck at their jobs. I've noticed a huge discrepancy, unfortunately, with how the market has transitioned recently among sales individuals.
[01:05] What I mean is unfortunately sales people have become what I call fat cat closers. Imagine you ran a car dealership and you get a hundred people a day that come to the dealership.

[01:18] You're the owner of the dealership and you go to your salespeople and you're like, "What's going on, guys? Like, why aren't people buying cars?" They say something along the lines of, "They're not watching videos about the cars they want to buy before they come into the dealership. They're not watching videos about the new Urus before they walk in."
[01:35] What would you say if you were the owner of that dealership? Those sound like shitty sales people, don't they? All these internet-based salespeople recently, it's crazy to me. They all expect people to watch videos before they actually buy.
[01:50] Recently, I've noticed a huge issue. Once again, it's just all relative to sales people needing trained. So, I'm going to tell you about my time when I used to work at Grant Cardone's office.
[02:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Grant Cardone Sales Structure"

VISUAL: Estrutura organizacional do escritório de Grant Cardone, sistema de treinamento
[02:05] Okay? So, I was 19 years old at the time and Grant recruited me. My job was to work very closely with the sales team. I was initially responsible for Infusionsoft. For all those who don't know what that is, the email marketing platform, CRM, and I did all the emails initially for my first three months of working there before I went into full-on marketing mode.
[02:28] You know, Grant's salespeople, they didn't know how to use the CRM one bit. They had no fucking clue. You know what they were doing every day? Show up, they'd build their own lead list and they dial leads.
[02:40] If they didn't dial 200 people, they'd be reprimanded. They were all statistically tracked to the T for their outbound dials, for their connection rates, for their closes.

[02:53] And as a matter of fact, they didn't just track the statistics in some random dashboard. They literally printed them on the wall every day. So every day you'd show up, there'd be a giant wall of a whole bunch of graphs. And the graphs were the amount of revenue that each salesperson was producing along with those other statistics.
[03:15] Before they'd show up, they had to watch six Cardone University videos, which are sales training videos before they even walk into the office. And that was tracked.

NÚMEROS: 6 vídeos obrigatórios, 9:00 AM sharp, 45 minutos de role play
VISUAL: Rotina matinal estruturada: vídeos → reunião → role play → dials
[03:28] Once they showed up, they had a morning meeting, 9:00 a.m. sharp. Grant himself would be there. They would do more training and they would collectively go over the statistics of the organization.
[03:40] After the morning meeting, they would role play for about 45 minutes. Then they would do their lead list building and their 200 dials structured, right?
[03:50] What's your sales organization like? What's your client's sales organization like? Do you do anything even close to what I just said? Do your people have a structure?
[04:00] Here's the issue that I found when I rolled out the Hydra. I didn't anticipate this. When I say sales people are like fat cat closers, I don't mean that in a disrespectful way. To be clear, I mean it in a terminology way where I'm just trying to describe a certain type of salesperson.
[04:18] A type of salesperson that no longer trains. A type of salesperson that expects somebody to already be sold when they speak to them after watching a video that does all the selling.

[04:30] I get all these sales people that say things like, "Oh, I want to watch the video. They're not fucking coming mentally framed before the call." Who gives a fuck?
[04:40] If I was a jeweler and I had somebody coming in to buy an engagement ring, wouldn't it be dope if they watched a video on the four C's about diamonds before they came in? What's the probability they're going to buy a better diamond if they did? Better, right?
[04:55] How many of you have ever bought jewelry? Raise your hand. Did you watch a video on the four C's before you walked in? Did you still buy?

[05:05] See how fucking dumb it sounds out loud. I mean, just it's unbelievable. But it comes from a lack of structure. I'm under the mental frame that anything affects my ROI, I'm going to take responsibility for it.
[05:20] Okay? Because I have rev shares in every deal we do. I'm not a sales trainer. I'm not a sales director. I won't be. I will be for my organization, but I won't be for all my clients.
[05:32] What I've done and what I want to pass down to you guys for what you need to do is the structure you have to have for any lead-based system to work that's not just a VSSL call scheduling funnel.
[05:45] If you're going to run the Hydra, you're going to generate a fuckload of leads, you need to have a proper sales structure in place for it to work at scale, especially. Does that make sense?

[06:00] Okay. So, few things real quick. First of all, the sales training that the organizations have access to. If you're not going to do the training yourself, they have to have sales training like programs and shit they could log in with.
[06:12] I'm going to name a few. Obviously, I'm a huge fan of Grant Cardone University. We have a guy coming tomorrow. He's a sales trainer. He's going to do a Hydra sales training with us. His name's Jordan Stupart.
[06:25] I used to work with him at Grant's office back in the day. He worked there for six years. He was his top salesperson. He closed Sprint on a corporate contract worth multiple seven figures for sales training.

[06:40] He's going to do a sales training for us on the Hydra tomorrow. He's somebody who has a program called Stupart Sales Academy. I have all my guys train on it. I think he's the most accessible sales trainer of anybody that I can refer you to.
[06:55] He does live calls I think literally every day. Josh Leo, how often does he do live calls? He does live calls quite frequently that your staff, that client staff can jump on to and train on.
[07:08] Um, I'm a little hit or miss on this guy, but Jeremy Miner, he has some good stuff, but some of his stuff is terrible. Really hit or miss, honestly. But some of it's good. Jeremy Miner's got a good one. More expensive though than any other sales training program. And like I said, not the best by far.

[07:28] There's a few others. There's a guy named Eli Wild. He's got a sales training program. He likes to say that it's built for agencies, but I think it's good stuff that can be applicable to a lot of the clients that sell high ticket.
[07:42] And then to be clear, the owner of the fucking business is a sales trainer. Okay? It's unbelievable to me. It's like truly unbelievable to me that most of the clients I work with, they're good at sales themselves, but they don't act as their internal sales trainer.
[08:00] They push off responsibility instead. If you're the business owner running the organization, guess where all the money from your business comes from? Yeah. Right. Yeah. Marketing helps. Yeah. Funnels and shit help. Absolutely.

[08:18] But guess who actually closes the deals, puts the money in the payment processor that then goes into your company account? The fucking salespeople.
[08:28] The amount of responsibility that has been pushed onto the organization instead of being self responsible for running the sales team on these owners, it's just nuts to me.
[08:40] So, I want to be clear. Have every client you work with or in your own organization buy as many sales training programs as you can. Structure a process where they have to watch X amount of videos a day before they start the day. That's the best way to go into the day.

[09:00] You've all had a terrible morning in your life, I'm sure. You know, last week I was having trouble eating food. By the end of the day, I was feeling woozy. You know, I was like, I'm going to fucking pass out from how little food I've eaten today.
[09:15] Because of that, my mornings were terrible. There were like three days last week where I was like, fuck. You know, I stepped into the day on a bad foot, okay? It fucked up the rest of my day.
[09:28] I had to really take hold of the rest of the day in order for it to be good and productive. All from a bad foot into the day.
[09:35] Vice versa, the opposite of that is if I wake up and I'm a salesperson and all I'm going to do in the day is fucking talk to people on the phone and close them. What is an ideal way to step into the day in that type of profession?
[09:50] I want to listen to people tell me how to be better at my job. I want to listen to people who are going to fire me up and give me little tips. Anything I could listen to before I actually start the day that says, "Yeah, dude, you're going to be great today."

[10:20] Ask your salespeople and don't let them lie to you how they start their day and just see how they start their day in comparison to how they should start their day.
[10:30] Now, the point is with those sales trainings that you're going to buy, that's step one. They all need to consume just like Grant's team, six videos before they walk into the office. Okay?
[10:42] Now, that does not omit the responsibility for the owner to then train them or the sales director or the sales manager, whoever it is. That's step two.

[10:55] For those with in-person teams, soon as they show up to the office, what are you going to do? Gather them up, get them in the fucking office, and do some sales training.
[11:05] Let me give you some examples of professional sports teams and what they would do. How many of you have heard of watching game footage? How many of you played sports and watched game footage?
[11:15] In my high school, we were fucking awful. That's the last time I played sports. We were awful cuz we never fucking watched game footage.

[11:28] I don't remember my coaches one time telling me to watch ESPN or to watch the game that night or to watch the game that we just played ourselves or to watch some of the footage from these other teams. They never said that.
[11:42] Were the players bad or were the coaches bad in that example? It all starts with the coach, doesn't it?
[11:50] Remote or not, you start the day with a sales training with the internal staff after they've watched the six videos before they even walked in. Does that make sense?
[12:00] Why are we going to do that? Because we want our people fucking focused before they take a call. The probability of them closing a deal is substantially greater when they are consistently trained.

[12:32] As sad as it is, when you take an action consistently it compounds, that's just the physical resemblance of it. All of what we're talking about is a mental and bank account resemblance. That's where we're going to see the differences.
[12:45] If I take an action day in and day out, if I work out every day versus just three times a week, am I going to get stronger sooner than the person who only works out three times a week? You see what I'm saying?

[13:00] Sales teams are fucking lazy nowadays. But is it their fault or is it your fault or is it the business owner's fault? Depends on how structured you want it to be.
[13:12] Grant's internal sales meetings were about 30-ish minutes every day. Sometimes they're a little longer. In fairness, sometimes they were a little shorter. Just depends on the day and what you choose to do.
[13:25] Some days they would have us watch a full Grant video. Some days they would just read a couple chapters out of the book, like some random pages out of a chapter. Other days Grant would just give some random lesson himself.

[14:22] You understand why we do that versus the nerd way of doing it.
[14:28] Then we let our sales people go into the day. And before we end the meeting, we set an expectation. We don't want to pressure our sales people with an unrealistic number.

[14:58] All right, great, man. Let's put those two to three on the board. Let me know in real time if you need help. Does that make sense?
[15:05] Okay. As I mentioned, after Grant's morning meeting, he would then do a role play session. You know who does role play? I'm not talking sexual shit. I'm talking in sales training.

[15:32] We have to elevate our game. That's the difference between people who make a fuckload of money and a couple hundred K a month. They elevate the game.
[15:42] How often have you heard those crazy fucking stories of Kobe Bryant where he's like, "Oh, his daughter's in the hospital and he's at the fucking gym putting up a thousand shots in the same spot in a row." You know?

[16:15] It doesn't come from just being talented. Almost all of you in here are talented at what you do. All of your clients are great at what they do. But holy shit are you playing lazy right now, aren't you?

He has these role playing things in his fucking program where they just say shit where they're like, "Oh, so what got you interested in X? Oh, ABC did." What? That sounds dumb.
[17:00] It's like do real sales training, real role plays like from things that happened yesterday. Okay, here's a real objection I got. How would you overcome it? You ready? Go. And then you're going to role play for a little bit. Just go back and forth so you can get more perspective.

[17:32] Most people stay the same because they have the same data in their head they had yesterday. We have to put new perspectives into our fucking brains to think differently than we are right now in this moment. Does that make sense?
[17:45] The new perspectives are what help us in real time when we deal with that objection. "Oh, I remember what Jerry said in my roleplay earlier today. I'm going to use his way of overcoming this objection because I was insecure about overcoming that before."

[18:15] Do you think a business that does that routinely day in and day out would make more money than a business that doesn't?
[18:22] There's this concept called the velocity of change. So, right now, everything you're learning feels good. Do you notice how you almost feel like you're progressing right now in this moment?

[18:50] The velocity of change means how fast can we take new things we're exposed to and implement them in the business?
[19:00] My responsibility is to help my clients with the velocity of change. I have to get them to do things faster to make more money faster, don't I?
[19:10] But can I do everything in their organization when they have 20, 30 staff? It's the CEO's responsibility. Cycle management. How fast can we learn something and implement it? Learn something and implement it. Learn something and implement it.

[19:45] The same applies for anything in that fucking business. But I want to highlight very specifically the sales training aspects of this. Okay?
[19:55] You have to make sure that when you tell your clients to do all this shit that they actually do it fast. Otherwise, another month's going to go by of 7,000 fucking leads and one deal getting closed. Does that make sense?

[21:15] I give you this perspective because like I said, most sales people, their leaders omit responsibility to make their full life, not just their professional life, but their full life well-rounded because it affects the performance in the job. Right?

[22:00] Okay. Now, during the day, the craziest thing happens. You just let the salespeople run loose. And generally, you don't even do any kind of end of day action to round everybody up and talk about what happened that day.

[22:40] My coaches, whenever we played sports and we ended the games, we'd go back to the locker room and they would just tell us we were bad.

[24:10] When we start the day, we're doing a morning meeting and we're going to go over something like game footage or we're going to talk about something that went well yesterday or we're going to have the team share what didn't go well yesterday so everybody can improve collectively.
[24:25] We're then going to role play. Then they're going to hit the phones.
[24:30] While they're in the game, we are going to make sure they have help when needed. Okay, availability of a trainer in real time is necessary for real time improvement.
[24:42] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Real-Time Support System"
NÚMEROS: Dúzias de vezes por semana
VISUAL: Sistema de suporte em tempo real, disponibilidade para perguntas durante calls
[24:45] Let's say I'm on a call and I need help. I could get the person close, but I don't know what to say. What's your current system in your organization or in your client's organization to get that help in real time when needed?
[25:00] Probably nothing. That's probably why you're losing a fuckload of deals. We need real time help and support for our people in the moment. Okay?
[25:10] If we're not in person and we're remote, they have to know that they can hit us up in real time with questions when necessary.
[25:18] Probably a dozen times a week, Leo shoots me a message that a random client or student is asking about. I'll give them the answers. Am I busy as fuck? Yeah. Do I still stop my day to make sure I give them those answers? Fucking yeah, I do. And I always will.
[25:35] Do your clients do that? Do you do that?
[25:40] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "End of Day Protocol"
NÚMEROS: N/A
VISUAL: Encerramento do dia com desenvolvimento, não apenas vendas
[25:42] And like I said, at the end of the day, to recap, I have to have something there that helps them. It doesn't need to be sales training to be clear.
[25:52] It can be some type of personal development. Maybe I provide books. Maybe I provide courses. Maybe I provide resources or just recommendations for what they can do outside of the office to improve.
[26:05] Maybe I buy them gym memberships. Maybe I buy them a health club membership. Maybe I get them fucking a recovery center somewhere nearby where they can go to chiropractic or red light therapy or infrared shit, you know?
[26:20] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Personal Development Investment Examples"
NÚMEROS: $2,000 para sauna infravermelho
VISUAL: Lista de investimentos: academia, health club, recovery center, sauna, personal trainer
[26:22] Maybe I pay two grand to get them an infrared sauna in their house. You get what I'm saying? I'm just going to do something to help improve their lives.
[26:32] Maybe I pay for a group personal trainer for the staff. You get what I'm saying? Maybe I give them corporate cards and just tell them to spend money on shit like that. You get what I mean?
[26:45] Okay. Does this make a difference to the sales team's performance?
[26:50] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Self-Assessment Questions"
NÚMEROS: N/A
VISUAL: Perguntas reflexivas sobre estrutura atual vs estrutura ideal
[26:52] How do your sales team stack up right now against the structure I just described? And be honest with yourself. Where is the room for improvement?
[27:02] Write it down. Ask yourself honestly, what could I do in my client's staff or in my own staff to improve my current structure that I have for my sales organization?
[27:15] And if you don't know, ask your salespeople. I guarantee they'll tell you if they're not going to, if you have an open relationship with them.
