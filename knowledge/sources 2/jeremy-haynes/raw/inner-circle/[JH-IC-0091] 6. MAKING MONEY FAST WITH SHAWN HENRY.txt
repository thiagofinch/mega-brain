Transcrição Completa: Making Money Fast with Shawn Henry   [00:00] All right, cool. So, few things that I wanted to talk about um both that tie into the agency stuff and fundamentally have changed the way that I look at how I make money and how quickly I make money.   [00:15] Um you know, for a long time there I always felt like I could be moving more quickly, but I didn't have a framework in which I could actually accomplish that. Um you know, it was like kind of like random. I didn't have like a a mental model, so to speak, on how I could make more money more quickly.   [00:35] Um, both that contributed to both my agency and, you know, my clients being able to make more money to where our fastest now that we've gone from a completely new high ticket offer to a million a month has been two months.   [00:50] Um, just like completely fresh like new offer to a million a month in two months. And the way that we accomplish that is the same way that I was able to then now scale up trading to where my biggest month has now been 750,000.   [01:05] That's all profit by the way, obviously pre-taxes, but again, that's just where I was able to do that in a very short amount of time without leveraging any of my capital, right?   [01:18] And so, to be clear, it all comes from the same framework. And I I I say this with a lot of like, you know, I'm not going to get up here and maybe get as animated as Jeremy in some ways, but I I actually feel this in a very deep way because I am the first inner circle member.   [01:35] And I I know a lot of people that have been here for a while that just that have not necessarily progressed at the speed in which I know they want to progress, but also in the speed in which like I would have just quite frankly expected them to at the end of the day.   [01:52] Because I've definitely had my shortfalls, you know, my shortcomings and and my my pitfalls, but at the end of the day, you should over a long period of time end up farther.   [02:03] And so I'll talk about the first thing that I changed um both in my own life and in my business is I do this independently. So I do this individually, but this is also something that I have my team do.   [02:18]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Time Collapsing Framework"   NÚMEROS:  2 meses para $1M/mês, $750,000 maior mês em trading   VISUAL:  Conceito visual de compressão de tempo, comparação entre progresso tradicional vs acelerado, linha do tempo condensada   [02:20] Um it came about because I wanted to figure out kind of, you know, I I had heard a few people talk about that it's not just about making money, it's about collapsing time, right?   [02:32] You don't want to make a million a month or a million dollars, you know, a day, like whatever that is. You don't want to get to that point over the course of 50 years or 60 years. You want to do that as quickly as possible, right? Like, you want to do that as quickly as possible.   [02:48] And so, I came up with the time collapsing exercise that I'm about to show you. Some of you will listen to this and you will hear it and you will say, "Oh, okay. That sounds pretty cool."   [03:00] And then you might do it, but you won't fully actually embrace it. And I can promise you for those of you that start using and deploying this at whatever level you're at right now. I don't care what level you're at right now that you'll be able to make more money more quickly.   [03:18] Some of you will just kind of brush it off though. And I know that just statistically. I've talked to a lot of people about this. But some of you will really lean into this and I will see some crazy like I mean some crazy shit results in literally a week from now if you actually apply this.   [03:35]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "7-Day Time Collapsing Exercise"   NÚMEROS:  7 dias, 90 dias   VISUAL:  Framework circular mostrando ciclo semanal, setas conectando 7 dias a 90 dias, ícone de compressão temporal   [03:38] So it's called the 7-day time collapsing exercise. Everything I talk about is very simple, by the way. It sounds very like, "Oh, yeah, no shit." But, uh, I try to make everything as simple as possible.   [03:52] The 7-day time collapsing exercise. And it goes like this. First and foremost, you set a very aggressive 90-day goal. You need to know exactly at the end of the quarter where you want to be.   [04:08] Not like where you think you can be, but where you want to be. And like I talked about, the goal is to collapse time. And in order to do that, you have to think outside the realm of who you are right now and outside of the realm of like the time limitations that you have put on yourself right now in order to get there.   [04:28] Who's following? Yeah. Make sense?   [04:32] 90 days. You said 90 days.   [04:35] Yeah. You have to be very clear where you want to be in 90 days.   [04:40] Can you hear me?   [04:42] Cool. Yeah. I I can always speak up if you need it, too.   [04:46]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "90-Day Aggressive Goal Setting"   NÚMEROS:  90 dias, meta agressiva   VISUAL:  Timeline de 90 dias destacada, seta apontando para meta final, distinção visual entre "onde você pensa que pode estar" vs "onde você QUER estar"   [04:48] Cool. And so once you're clear on the 90-day goal, you do this either every Sunday. So usually what I do is I do this every Sunday with myself and every Monday I have the team do this.   [05:02] Every single major team member, even like smaller team members, I put through this exercise. And this has changed the way that we do business, how quickly we achieve results.   [05:15] I asked myself if I had seven days to actually achieve this goal like gun to my head like I would get fucking killed like merked at the end of this seven days if I did not achieve this goal how would I actually achieve it.   [05:32] Like not what is the stepping stone so I'm on track for 90 days and at the end of this seven days like how do I incrementally make sure that at the end of the seven days I can project out that I'll hit my goal no the answer is how do I creatively approach this week to actually accomplish a 90-day goal in 7 days.   [05:55]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "7-Day Challenge: Gun to Your Head Mentality"   NÚMEROS:  7 dias para atingir meta de 90 dias   VISUAL:  Ícone de urgência extrema, comparação visual entre pensamento incremental vs pensamento revolucionário, destaque em vermelho para urgência   [05:58] This is how we're scaling to a million a month. This is this exact line of thinking is what allowed us to again scale a million a month offer in less than two months from zero.   [06:10] To scale from, you know, scale our client Marcel from 200k a month to 2 million a month in less than six months, right?   [06:18]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Case Study: Marcel"   NÚMEROS:  $200K/mês → $2M/mês, menos de 6 meses   VISUAL:  Gráfico de crescimento exponencial, seta ascendente dramática, multiplicador de 10x destacado   [06:22] Literally like, you know, and and for us that was like impossible like we we had never seen anything happen that quickly. But that line of thinking was creatively thinking week after week after week with the team and challenging them to collapse time in their own way.   [06:38] And I know it sounds very simple, but for a lot of you that may feel like you're stuck. It's because you aren't focus. You're focusing on the money, but you're not focusing on how you creatively need to approach the next goal that you have to do it more quickly.   [06:55] Because the reality is the same way of thinking that you have right now will not enable you to hit your goal. So part of what Jeremy's talking about is if you approach the next 90 days as you have with the same way of thinking without forcing yourself to grow into a new version of yourself that you will never actually reach that goal in a way that stays stable.   [07:18] Does that make sense?   [07:20] Yeah.   [07:22] So again, like hopefully and I'm sharing this with a very like very cognizantly that some of you will take this and apply it and I guarantee you like we'll hear some really crazy stuff in the inner circle group.   [07:35] You'll be like, "Yeah, I applied the 7-day time compression exercise and literally seven, you know, in seven days I was able to make more money than I have in the last two months. I've literally taught this and I I've heard that."   [07:48]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Threshold to Visible Results"   NÚMEROS:  2 componentes   VISUAL:  Diagrama de porta/gateway, duas colunas dividindo Mindset e Skillset, setas convergindo para "Resultados Visíveis"   [07:50] The second piece of this though is for those of you that are kind of considering and and this before I get into the trading the agency stuff, but it all ties together.   [08:00] The next piece of this is that there are specific goals that you want to hit that you have not hit yet. Jeremy talks about like making a decision, but I'll talk about a framework that I've been teaching my team that's been working very well for us.   [08:15] And this is the idea that every visible result that you want, there is a threshold that is made up of two parts. It's mindset and skill set.   [08:28] Sounds easy, right? But it's actually a lot more applicable than you think. There is a threshold to visible results for every goal that you want to hit. And it's made up of two parts. Mindset and skill set.   [08:42]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Mindset + Skillset = Identity = Results"   NÚMEROS:  2 partes (Mindset + Skillset)   VISUAL:  Equação visual, Mindset (crenças) + Skillset (conhecimento) = Identity (quem você se torna) → Baseline → Resultados Visíveis, fluxo em cascata   [08:45] Mindset is what you believe. Your beliefs and your skill set is what you know. And in a combination with what you believe and what you know, you become somebody, right? That's your identity.   [09:00] And as a result of holding that identity for long enough, consistently enough, you create a baseline. Then you will see the visible results that come out of that.   [09:12] So, if you want to hack, no matter what level you're trying to reach at the next point, like again, I don't care if you're trying to build a 9 figure company or not, or literally you're just trying to hit your first 100k month.   [09:25] The question that you have to ask yourself is from the mind from the side of mindset, what beliefs do I need to get rid of and what do I need to add that are that are reflective of that person or that goal that I want to have?   [09:42] Because without that, you it's not like, oh, it'll take longer to hit it. It's just it'll you'll never fucking hit it ever. Results are a effect. They're not a cause.   [09:55]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Results Are An Effect, Not A Cause"   NÚMEROS:  N/A   VISUAL:  Diagrama de causa e efeito invertido, setas mostrando que Identity → Actions → Results (não o contrário), destaque visual para quebra de paradigma   [09:58] And again, some of you have heard this before. I'm just trying to tell you like this is like every time my team goes to hit a new goal, we literally talk about this every time.   [10:08] Okay, what are the beliefs that need to change in order for us to hit this goal? And I go through and I fix this with every single team member on my team in order to do that. And it becomes that becomes a new standard. If they don't rise to that, then they get cut.   [10:25] It's the same thing with myself. I have to ask myself that. And then from skill set it's like okay what are the things that I need to learn or what do I need to know that are at that level in order for that to be a reality.   [10:38] And how do I hold that for like being clear on that then it's just a game of holding that for as long as you can and that's practice right it's not like you snap your fingers unless you get hypnotized.   [10:50] If you have all of those things and you get hypnotized that that's actually an asset so if you have all those things and you're like these are the belief systems and these this is what I want to change like you you can also deploy that skill or deploy that tool in order to get.   [11:08] Make sense?   [11:10] So these are the two frame like this is all these are the main two frameworks that we deploy in our business that allow us to move more quickly but it's also what allowed me to grow into trading.   [11:22]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Trading Journey Timeline"   NÚMEROS:  Janeiro 2020 (início), $20-30K/mês (inicial), $750K (maior mês), $40-50K em 15 minutos/dia (atual)   VISUAL:  Timeline de progressão, gráfico de crescimento exponencial em trading, destaque para evolução de resultados   [11:25] So um another inner circle member Xan got me into trading January I I I want to say like 2020 but I can't really remember. I think it was 2020 and um it took me a long time to figure it out.   [11:38] And when I did figure it out, I was trading with my own money. And then I got to a point where I was doing like 20 to 30K a month trading, like day trading.   [11:48] Um, and then I stopped to be quite honest because it just wasn't like enough money to get me excited to start day trading. And then I got hypnotized and then I came up with the 7-day time compression exercise.   [12:02] And I said, "Okay, well, what would I know that?" And and to be clear, the way I day trade, I wake up in the morning, I trade the open, I trade for 15 minutes, and I'm done.   [12:15]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "15-Minute Trading System"   NÚMEROS:  15 minutos/dia, $40-50K/dia, $750K maior mês   VISUAL:  Relógio mostrando 15 minutos, gráfico de retorno por hora, comparação de eficiência temporal vs retorno financeiro   [12:18] All the money I make is made in less than 15 minutes. I don't teach this to anybody. To be clear, like for money, this is just what I do. Jeremy wanted me to share this. I don't talk about this with most people, but you know, obviously I'm sharing it with you guys.   [12:35] Um, so it just wasn't enough money to get me excited because I I had my agency. I had other things I could focus on. So I asked myself, I'm like, well, I know I can make a lot of like my hourly return is there. How do I change that?   [12:50] So, I wanted two things. I needed access to more capital and I didn't want it to be mine. And I had to figure out how I could build this system in a way that's so simple that I didn't have to do any kind of research. I didn't have to do anything like that.   [13:08] And so, I dumbed it down. I said, "Okay, if I were to do this in 7 days, I need to come up with this goal. What would I do?" And I executed on that and to the point where now again like the biggest month that I've had is 750k.   [13:25] To where now I'm averaging $40 to $50,000 in 15 minutes every day of the week. And a lot of you are trying to hit like and I I don't mean this in like a demeaning way, but a lot of you are trying to hit 30k 50k extra a month in your business.   [13:42]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Leverage Your Time & Skillset"   NÚMEROS:  $30-50K/mês (meta comum) vs $40-50K em 15 minutos   VISUAL:  Comparação visual dramática, balança mostrando tempo investido vs retorno, conceito de alavancagem temporal   [13:45] But if you force yourself into a way of thinking of like creatively being able to figure out how you can leverage your time and your skill set better, you can do that in the course of 15 minutes.   [13:58] And so that's that's how powerful this exercise is. It forced me to figure that out. It literally forced me to figure that out. And a lot of you are in a position where you're just doing the same thing all the time, getting the same result.   [14:12] And so that's the side of trading. Now, let's talk about on the agency side of things. Who wants me to talk more about like building a team and being able to like, you know, where I don't really work too much in the agency anymore?   [14:25] Who would rather me spend some time talking about like offers, charging charging a lot of money? Charging like more money for what you do. Cool. Okay.   [14:38]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Pricing Paradigm Shift: Marcel Case Study"   NÚMEROS:  $1,000,000/ano, 4 horas/mês, clientes $100M+ ou bilionários   VISUAL:  Estrutura de precificação premium, perfil de cliente ideal (ultra high net worth), relação valor/tempo dramaticamente desproporcional   [14:40] So, my paradigm of charging a lot of money was broken uh when I started working with my client Marcel, who's a hypnotist. And um it's really interesting because I asked him how much he charges for his one-on-one services to work with him one-on-one.   [14:58] And he said a million dollars a year. It's a million dollars a year to work with him for four hours of his time. Um and that man, I was I was fucking I like I couldn't even fucking believe it. Like a million dollar a year for four hours a month. It's like that's fucking crazy.   [15:18] Except for it's not because the people that he works with are either worth over a hundred hundred million dollars or they're billionaires. He might work with a crypto billionaire that needs to have his emotions perfectly in check.   [15:32] And the difference between them being able to make an extra B and not is how they manage their mindset and how you can overcome limiting beliefs. And those people pay it all day long. They'll pay a million dollars all day long to have the perfect mindset all the fucking time. Fucking yeah.   [15:50]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Price Positioning Strategy"   NÚMEROS:  $10K/mês → $30-50K/mês + upfront + rev share   VISUAL:  Escada de preços, evolução de posicionamento, componentes de precificação (upfront + recorrente + performance)   [15:52] And so it started to change in me like to be able to conceptualize like either you need to sell to a richer audience or you have to analyze what somebody will pay to get out of pain.   [16:08] Instead of focusing on what you're worth, you need to focus more on the client. I think that you spend so much time if you're worried about like how much you need to charge.   [16:20] So I went from charging 10K a month to 30 to 50K a month plus doing that now upfront and collecting rev shares. And so for us and and that's a very comfortable place for us because those are the type of businesses we want to work with.   [16:38] But also to where that hits our kind of our threshold for paying attention to a deal. But a lot of you here might be kind of trying to figure out like how do you charge more money or in your head you're like how do you justify it in your own head charging more money?   [16:55] But the reality is it actually has nothing to do with your client and everything to do with you. And you're like, "Well, I don't know if I'm worth that much." Okay, fine. Take it off of yourself for a second and ask yourself like, "Okay, well, how much your would your client pay to get out of pain to work with somebody that could actually do that?"   [17:18] If you force yourself into a situation where you now charge like for example, do you have an agency? What do you charge?   [17:28] 6,500.   [17:30] 6,500. Do you want to charge more?   [17:33] Yeah.   [17:35] Cool. So what keeps you from doing that in your head?   [17:40] Value.   [17:42] Like you feel like you're not delivering the value. Is that is that the concern?   [17:48] Offer value more or less not focused on their pain but on the value what we're providing them based on the market.   [17:58]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Price Point Perception & Market Positioning"   NÚMEROS:  $6,500 (exemplo), $50-150K (carros comparação), $200K+ (premium tier), $500K-1M (ultra premium)   VISUAL:  Pirâmide de precificação, agrupamento perceptivo por faixas de preço, separação visual entre tiers de mercado   [18:00] Okay. So when you charge 6,500, everything is relative, right? So when you tell somebody that you charge 6,500 bucks, you think they group you in with everybody else that's charging around that price, even if it's 3K, it's like, well, that's just 3,500 more than 3K.   [18:20] How much do you think they start to kind of group you in with everybody else? Like you look at all the cars that are between like call it like 50,000 and 150,000 and their value because of their price point is pretty pretty grouped in.   [18:35] Like you kind of like you're like yeah it's the same caliber of car and then you start to get into the 200,000s. Then you see the cars that are now going for 500k or a million dollars and you start to realize wow those cars must have something special.   [18:50] Not necessarily true, just to be clear, but their price point means something. Does your price point mean something at all in the marketplace?   [19:00] When I say my services are $50,000 a month, does that group me in with all the people that are charging 10K, 5K, 6K? No. They have to ask themselves like fucking he has the confidence to charge that which I do obviously because I know that we're going to get our clients a return.   [19:20]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Price = Identity Reflection"   NÚMEROS:  Correlação direta entre preço cobrado e identidade   VISUAL:  Espelho refletindo identidade através do preço, equação visual mostrando "What You Charge = Who You Are", destaque para alinhamento identitário   [19:22] You have people like you have some you have you have mentors within the inner circle that could make sure that your clients are doing that. You go on to your weekly Q&A with Jeremy and you can say, "Hey, this is what I'm dealing with with this client. Like how do I make sure that he makes even more money?"   [19:40] But you don't even think to potentially ask that because you're not putting yourself in a position where you're charging something that forces you to expand.   [19:50] What you charge is a reflection of your identity. Your belief systems. If you want to make more money, if you want to make more money, you making more money is a reflection of who? Your identity.   [20:05] Your beliefs and what you know and your beliefs around money. It's not like it everyone says like how you do anything is how you do everything. It's true because it's it's a reflection of your your identity. Your identity creates your the the world around you.   [20:25] But when you change nothing, you you change one thing, you change nothing. You can go and start doing sales calls, sales trainings, changing one thing, changing another thing, but until it's all reflective of this new person that you're trying to become, you're actually not going to get what you want.

[21:02] If you believe that you should be charging more money and you don't, then what are the odds that you're actually going to hit your goal? It's almost zero.   [21:12] Not because you can't charge like there are people that charge 3K a month or 2K a month and they hit a you know a million a month right like that that's not the issue but their their issue isn't an identity problem.   [21:25] If you think you should be charging more you should be charging more because until you charge more you're not in alignment with the identity that actually has that goal. Does that make sense?   [21:38] Like actually I know this is pretty high level but again like and maybe not for you guys but sometimes this just goes over people's heads. The results that you want are behind that like gateway, that door of the identity.   [21:52] The opportunity is a door. Your passion is a key. But if you don't know where it exists in the first place, how are you going to walk through it? That awareness comes as a result of who you are.   [22:08] If you don't know what to do, then you need to change. If I said like, hey, do you know exactly what you need to do to hit your goal? Do you know? Like clear as day. Like you know exactly what you need to do tomorrow, the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day to hit your goal. Do you know? Exactly. With perfect clarity.   [22:32] Sorry, I'm picking on you a little bit.   [22:35] I like it. Helping solve the problems.   [22:38] Say about 75 80% clear.   [22:42] Cool. Which means that you're not you're 75 to 80% of that person. Because if you were that person, seriously, what you knew and what you believed went in tandem, you would actually know exactly what to do.   [22:58] And that's why it's worth spending that time on the 7-day time compression on getting clear. Okay, this is the goal I want to hit. What are the what are the what do I need to believe? What beliefs do I need to get rid of? What do I need to add?   [23:15] So, you get very clear on that. And you can use other people that are already there as like a model. And then what do I need to know to get there?   [23:25] And again, I don't care if your goal is uh is is nine figures. It doesn't matter. It's the same thing. You have to in order for you to go from where you want to where you are to where you want to be, you have to get rid of beliefs and you have to add new beliefs. That's the truth. Sometimes it's just getting rid of fucking beliefs.

As far as running a team goes, um the infrastructure is like just in order to do less spend less time. Um the first thing that I'd start with is finding the key parts of your business that create results.   [24:08] So, usually it's sales, marketing, and delivery, right? What I did was I broke each of those parts into as simple of frameworks as I possibly could in order to allow results to be replicatable.   [24:25] Because it's very difficult. It's very very difficult to train people on entire processes because it's it's like it's almost equivalent to like if I showed you like I was an artist and I showed you a painting that I had painted and I'm like, "All right, here's the painting. Go and make that."   [24:42] It's not going to work, right? Because you're seeing the macro. You're seeing all of the macro. Even though I could tell you exactly how I did it, each brush stroke, it doesn't matter until you have frameworks that people can grow into.

What are the main frameworks that I do that allow me to close deals, principles, belief systems in order for me that for me to do what I do? I made it as simple as humanly possible.   [25:18] Literally like like my whole goal that I came up with with the time compression when I had done that exercise is I need to make this to where I can put a really like not a highly talented individual in here but like really really dumb but them still be able to at least produce minimum results.   [25:38] So for sales it was like okay I'm looking at like the the very simple frameworks that like allow me to close deal what I think allows me to close deals versus somebody else. Okay, for me like and again I'm not a sales expert. I just tried to like break it down.   [25:55] So for me it was like okay I look at a deal I make sure that I set the frame for authority. I make sure that they're preframed in this and then with anybody that has sales conversations less is more. So I just I have them talk about less and this is just like this is what I broke down.   [26:15]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Marketing Framework: Zero to One vs One to Infinity"   NÚMEROS:  2 fases distintas   VISUAL:  Linha divisória clara, Fase 1 (0→1): Launch até primeiras vendas consistentes, Fase 2 (1→∞): Escala e replicação previsível   [26:18] Same thing with marketing. With marketing, I have very simple framework. Zero to one and one to infinity. Zero to one is from zero to a new launch for a new client to their first consistent profitable sales that you can predictably produce.   [26:38] And then one to infinity, which is scaling, like taking initial revenue-driven actions and predictably repeating those over and over and over again at scale.   [26:50] So I created individual flowcharts and frameworks that went into that that allowed them to start thinking and following that. So I already took people that knew the system or knew marketing and then I would plug them in and I'd have them everything you do you follow this at each step and they would follow that.   [27:10] I broke everything into frameworks and ways to think instead of focusing on like teaching them skills. Teaching skills is like okay we could give them a library of stuff to learn from there. It's just how do you actually apply that?   [27:25] And so again, I just break things down into the simple way of thinking. It's like the seven-day time compression. Sounds very stupid, like stupid easy, right? But it works.

And so then I took that and hired a COO. That was one of the biggest things that I did. She she does things uh much better than I do when it comes to execution.   [27:55] Um but what I was able to do is I gave her all these frameworks and she just she doesn't have to know how to do everything, but she makes sure those frameworks are followed. That's her goal.   [28:08] Then over time she was able to know the frameworks well enough and worked with the team enough to where she became a savage marketer too. But it was literally like I tried to simplify things as much as possible with that.

[28:42] He'll go in if there are any red flags whether it's zero to one or one to infinity processes he'll go in and he'll diagnose it and fix it macro make sure that that's executed.   [28:55] Underneath him he has a chief media buyer we have a chief copywriter they both individually have their things that they're looking at in terms of KPIs to hit and standards to hit all within simple frameworks.

[29:30] So the first is is it so simple that a complete stranger would understand and is it boring? It's either a hell yes or a hell no. We just run every piece of copy, every piece of creative, every piece of every video script runs through that framework.   [29:48] And if it's it's a hell yes or a hell no. If it's not 100% out of 100%, yes, it's super simple. Even a stranger would understand. And no, it is not boring. If it doesn't hit that, then we redo it until it is.   [30:05] And that's and that's helped our efficiency as far as marketing results go up. We can hit CTR like make sure that initial launches are hitting CTR within their first launch almost every time just by doing that. From there, obviously, we're executing that with headlines and the rest of the funnel. So, super simple.

[30:42] So 33 every one winner creates new three winners. I can talk about that with other people later. I don't know how much time I have but I don't want to go too much into that.

We just have two of them and they're all VAS too from the Philippines. They're awesome.   [31:08] All they're doing all day is just assessing for areas where the client is either unhappy or needs more data or needs more information. We don't do weekly meetings either anymore.   [31:20] If the client needs to have a meeting and it's like necessary, then we'll they can schedule that independently. But recurring meetings we don't believe in just because again it's like just sharing the same thing. We want to focus on results.   [31:35] So that's the main thing as far as those go. Now I just want to open it up to Q&A because this is where I get to have like a lot of fun. Um you know obviously you can ask about trading, ask about the agency, anything. Yeah.   [31:50] Uh your COO.   [31:52] Yeah. So, what do you pay her? Do you give her like bonus structures?

So, when she first came in, I I took her from a bookkeeping firm. She just wanted to work at the business. Um, I started paying her $1,000 a month, literally. Like, she just wanted to be there.   [32:15] Um, because I'm very picky with who I bring in. Uh, over time, I started paying her 4K, uh, and then increased it from there. And then she also is positioned by the end of the year to potentially get part equity in the business.   [32:32] Um, because she does play that much of an integral role. And I don't want her going anywhere. It is her equity is contingent on her staying for x amount of time though.   [32:45] And then uh her being able to realize equity is when you sell the company.   [32:50] Yeah. I don't I mean equity is more it's more I think will very the she even knows it the likelihood of us selling the company because it's more a cash flow agency is very low. Um but but it's a loyalty thing. It's it's you know to show that I'm willing to give up a piece of of what I have for a long term.   [33:15] Yeah. Any other questions around the COO?   [33:18] Um, yeah. just about the equity part like I I understand like you want to show her like hey that you're   [33:28] It's symbolic for if you actually have a valuable piece of the business then obviously like you would just create a contingency base like I've seen other people do this to where it's literally just figure out what you know and I would talk to either an investment banker or somebody that like like an investment lawyer and figure out a structure that protects you uh for whoever you're trying to bring in.   [33:50] Yeah. Yeah, because every business is different. How you give up stock options, how you can give up equity, you do shares, like you can structure it differently.

[34:15] Any of those revenue metrics?   [34:18] I I get clear with the revenue metrics. Are you asking me my revenue metrics?   [34:22] No. Like uh is her with like in order for you to get a bonus.   [34:28] Yeah. It's client performance because like our agency is a lot like Jeremy's to where at any given time we have under 15 clients and so we're all revshare based.   [34:42] And so her ability to make sure that the company is moving smoothly, delivery is there, we're like she makes sure that 7-day uh time compression is being implemented on like our company goal to be clear is to do a billion dollars a year in sales for our clients.

And so in order to do that then we need to like she needs to keep running that time compression so that we keep thinking bigger and bigger and collapsing time more and more.   [35:20] But she she's just responsible for that. She knows she is. And um if we hit bigger and better goals then obviously you start to see those results.   [35:30] I just Yeah, you can we can chat about it too. Obviously, I'll share some of the stuff that I learned. It wasn't like necessarily smooth sailing right away, but like she I mean she basically runs the business for me at this point. Like it's she is absolutely critical.   [35:48] Thank you. I think mentally a lot of us or maybe I'm projecting um have the issue of even if we know we're not actually the best at doing every little piece, we find it really hard to delegate. How have you adjusted your mind around delegating pieces either the ones that aren't very high value ones that are?

So, I'll kind of bring it back to like trading, right? Trading I I I've tried to I've I've taught a few people, you know, I've probably I've taught this quite to to enough people to where I've seen who succeeds and who doesn't.   [36:25] Um, but the main reason people fail at trading is because they care more about seeing green today than being profitable for the rest of their life. And I say this to everybody that I train.   [36:38] Do you care more about being green today or do you care more about being profitable for the rest of your life?   [36:45] What you're saying is, you know, you know, I don't feel fully comfortable tra you know, doing X, Y, and Z. The the thing you have to ask yourself is would I rather be green today which is meaning even if I made mistakes somehow getting back up to where I needed to be.   [37:02] Or would I rather be profitable for the rest of my life but in your case like for the business it's would I rather hit my goals that I want to hit or would I rather stay basically green and safe for here for today or would I rather be as profitable or as rich as I want to be for the rest of my life.

So, in order for you to do that, you have to focus more on the identity and less on these actions because they're all a reflection of your identity.   [37:42] So, spend some time with the beliefs and and kind of play around with that. But everyone's journey to overcoming those beliefs are different. Um, but I would set a very ruthless standard for cutting those out.   [37:58] Like I would like the same ruthlessness you would give somebody else that's executing on specific tasks, you have to give yourself that same degree of ruthlessness to cut out the negative beliefs that are keeping you from actually getting where you want to be.   [38:15] Because then you're like, well, I want to have I want to eventually delegate these things. But the reality is um you will never come up with the creative answer to actually have them delegating better than you if you're forced into a paradigm where it's either black or white. Either I do it the best or they do it subpar. That's that's your frame. That's your frame.   [38:38] Right. Correct. It's it it's not it's not exactly what you're looking for. And so challenge and face those beliefs that are around that.   [38:50] Like really get clear on like if I want to hit this goal, what is the threshold to result in terms of skill set and mindset that I need to do in order to hit that?   [39:02] And then you'll be able to hit that more quickly because if you spend your time focusing on that instead of you know obsessing over the number or obsessing over the next action like the micro action like delegating then everything becomes very clear and a new standard gets set.   [39:20] Yeah, what's up?   [39:22] Can you talk a little bit about the sales for the agency? How you have it structured?

So, we have a we have a setter. Um we have and I have two sales people. Um one is more part-time because he's been with me for a while. He does a lot of training for some of our clients, too, in sales.   [39:48] Um and then and then we have a full-time closer that's closing some of these uh these new deals that we locked up for from the ads. But as far as the structure, are you asking like how how does the sales process go?   [40:02] Kind of. Yeah. And where where are the new deals coming from, too?   [40:08] Yeah. So, we have always have cold outreach going. Always like video. Correct. Yep. Yeah. We always have those going.

Um and and the goal of that is to get a runway uh where we started charging 30k for 90 days for like maybe a more limited version of our services.   [40:38] Very easy to fulfill on, but we wanted to runway those 5 to 10 people into the agency, basically cultivate our winning clients. Um, but we're willing to fire and refund those clients on a like on a fucking dime because our our our ads are performing quite well to be clear.   [40:55] The setter you have, who who's he or she reaching out to? Like all the leads that come in the video pitches and   [41:05] Yeah, they don't. No, not the video pitches. I try to segment.

If it's just you though, the again like I don't know if that's the case. Maybe you have a full team. But if it's just you, you should spend all your time on one thing.   [41:38] If you have the money for ads, you could go the ads route. If you have the money for the outbound, go the outbound. But you master one and then move to the next. Make sure that's consistent and predictable before you move to the next thing.   [41:52] Sounds good.   [41:55] Yeah, for sure. Any other questions? Are you good? I'm good for now. Cool.   [42:02] How many cold pitches are you sending out daily?   [42:05] Depends like at some point you start to kind of tap uh tap out. At the beginning it was like 100 to 200 and and now it's like 20 to 50 depending on the day.   [42:18] And do you think is that split between different niches or you go after one niche?

So it's it's less like personal brand specifically now which is kind of where we started and now it's just like we'll you know like we've worked with a financial services business that we did uh some really good results for. So we like as long as it's high ticket uh we're reaching out to them.   [42:52] Yeah. What's up?

Yeah. It's a great question. So either we'd renew them for another 90 days at 30K where like at some point basically at some point throughout the 90 days we're we're predictably like running we we start running ads for them right very easy once everything's set up and they have a choice.   [43:28] They can either upgrade to the 30 50k like midmon like mid 90 days which we push a lot of people to if if we're in the timing where we're taking on new partner clients.   [43:42] Or we start training their internal team which again we'll never execute it quite as fast as us and they know that but still beneficial and if they want to just continue then we'll just either like either we'll sell them into another 90 days or like in theory now that I'm thinking about we could just sell them in for another six months or a year since we've already delivered results.

Uh I mean do do you have you done much trading? Uh stock trading. Stock trading.   [44:20] So the my my system is very it's like again as simple as possible. Um there are specific indicators also like estimated moving averages in combination with um a dynamic indicator that I found that plots support and resistance.   [44:38] And I only play rejections. So, I play the two-minute ca candles and uh I play the open when volatility is the highest. I watch for these initial moves that then go and reject against these points as support and resistance.   [44:55] So, they might go up like five points on NASDAQ, reject down, and then that's where I take my like for example, if it's going up and it rejects down, that's where I take my short and then I'll put it uh put my stop loss above the that candle high and then I'll ride it down or up depending on that.   [45:15] The risk-to-reward is very good. That's that's why my my my strategy works off of rejections and then it has very very good risk-to-reward. So even if I lose two trades and I win one, I'm in a very good place.   [45:30] So that's that's how I built the system, but I can obviously I'm happy to talk to you about it, man. Yeah, there's obviously a little more that goes into it, but like at a broad level, that's how it was built.   [45:42] So I mean the one thing that you mentioned is in terms of increasing prices is just find uh find a richer audience to sell to. Yeah. Uh if if it if it makes sense, right? Like if you're selling to chiropractors, like there's not like you can only go so you can only go so high, you know?   [46:02] Yeah. So, fuck that niche. I know. I'm just teasing you. I'm just kidding. I've just known you for a long time, you know?   [46:12] Yeah. We just closed on that business, by the way, today. So, that's done and gone. Nice, bro. Congrats. That was that was the only good came out.   [46:22] Okay. But this is like 22 that I feel like happens with a lot of offers in general, whether it's an internal or not. If you guys are opening up things like paid ads and you guys are looking at 30, you know, 30 bands plus rep share and stacking these stack deals, what what is uh what is enabling you to to pull these super high tent businesses through channels where assumingly everybody else is struggling to get people to capitalize?

Correct. Yes.   [47:02] Yeah. So very very direct advertising like insanely direct like hey if you're watching this and again like I know you might even like hear this and be like oh yeah it's that easy. It's like in theory yeah you obviously have to say the right thing.   [47:18] So my belief is in in order to have successful marketing, you have to articulate your client's internal dialogue better than anybody else, right?   [47:28] And so with people that are wealthier, it means that I have to talk very directly to them and say, "Hey, listen. These are the exact problems you're struggling with. Here's this bit like like some big dick result that I've gotten or like overall, right?"   [47:45] We'll talk about the 300 million that we've done. We'll talk about stuff like that, right? And then the and then we'll very give a very strong guarantee with a lot of confidence.   [47:55] And then from there, our entire like it's same thing conditional logic.

[48:30] It's like that we're only targeting businesses that are making over 100K a month minimum and we're not having any problem finding people like that because I think there's a lot more of those people than you'd think and Facebook knows how to find them.   [48:45] So, it's like the one thing I tell my team is just never put limitations based off of what you've either you've done before or what you're what other people say is possible and just go out and do it because there's a way to do it creatively.   [49:02] And for us, it's and and I again it might sound simple and you you messaged me on Telegram. I'm happy to look at anything you're doing. Um but for us, like we're selling million-dollar contract like for Marcel that I keep bringing up the other day.   [49:18] Um actually like two weeks ago he closed two one-on-one clients through the ads in a week and that's not even who we go after. Just happened those people came through. Both those people are worth more than 100 million. Close them for a million dollars a year just through the ads.   [49:35] So it's like those people are there.

With conditional logic you mean like Yeah, like Type Form. Type form takes out the lowquality leads and and gets rid of them.   [50:05] What's up? Yeah, but like prop firms like proprietary firms. Yeah. And I just have a 9010 split with them and then I've spund as much as possible. So, I'm trading with about three million in capital.   [50:22]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Trading Capital Structure"   NÚMEROS:  $3M capital atual (prop firms), 90/10 split, meta $100M/ano, necessário $60-70M capital   VISUAL:  Estrutura de prop firms, split de lucros, projeção de escala de capital necessário   [50:25] I was just curious if you had your own fund structure or something like that. No, but that's what Jeremy is saying, you know, like cuz I want to do $100 million a year trading to be clear and I know I can do it.   [50:38] Uh I just have to find where the capital is in order to get to that next level. So I need to go from basically trading like 3 to 5 million in capital to going and trading like 60 to 70 million for other people. Yeah. So that's the plan. Yeah. That's the next step.   [50:55] In your type form when you do the conditional logic are you doing just based on reported revenue or income or do you do you also layer it for a few different questions?   [51:05]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "TypeForm Qualification Framework"   NÚMEROS:  2 pontos de fricção iniciais, 3 se necessário   VISUAL:  Duas camadas de qualificação: (1) Financial + (2) Commitment (long-form question), lei dos retornos decrescentes aplicada   [51:08] Yeah, I usually put two points of friction. Income and revenue is one. And then usually in terms of commitment because it's either it's either financial qualification or commitment like commitment to the process and engaging in the sales conversation like that kind of qualification.   [51:28] And so I'll usually put like some kind of long form question in there to ask to have them type something in because if they type something in even if it's one word that's more commitment than somebody answering a multiple choice.   [51:42] And then um and then a financial question. That's where I'll start. If they're still not qualified, then I'll add a third point of friction. But that's that's usually where I start.   [51:52] But how would you filter out that that uh open-ended question or whatever? Like that's just that's just f that's just interest. It's not I'm not filtering out. The only thing I'm filtering in that case like actually filtering is uh the financial question.   [52:08] For correct correct but in but it's like think about it at least perspect like my perspective again it's an oversimplification but you have to start somewhere and then you can adjust based off the data for each each client.   [52:25] But like in that case like start with the financial question. It's either financial qualification or interest qualification. Like they have to be like somewhat like more committed or interested to the sales process to actually engage in the sales conversation to then be led down the sales process to be able to get that to get the better leads.   [52:45] And so for us adding that long form that actually causes like them to think and commit plus that is it's like law of diminishing returns. We're not adding too much friction without having data to support it. And we're not we we have enough friction to get those people out. But I I don't want to add too much especially when I'm watching   [53:05] Filtering them out to for feedback based on their answer to that open-ended question. No.   [53:12] Just out of curiosity, is it an indicator you're using open? No, I don't use VWAP. I I just use I I play around with it. Um, usually it's like 921 50 200 pretty standard.   [53:28]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Trading Indicators Setup"   NÚMEROS:  EMAs: 9, 21, 50, 200   VISUAL:  Configuração técnica de indicadores, EMAs padrão, indicador dinâmico customizado de S/R, plataforma Ninja Trader   [53:30] Um, yeah, just the EMAs. But then I, like I said, I have another indicator that I found that before I was plotting my own support and resistance. Uh, but I found this that is a dynamic indicator that I built in originally found it on Trading View.   [53:48] And then um, a programmer brought it into Ninja Trader, which is what I use as my I guess whatever you the fuck you call it. Kind of like whatever platform you trade on like IBK or or anything like that. But yeah, that's uh that's what I brought it into and that's all I use to trade. Keep it pretty simple.   [54:08] Uh how long is your typical sales process for like the 30K package when you're closing on that? Like how long does it take? Like like a one call close usually. Mhm. And then as far as or or we follow Yeah. Yeah. Like some deals it might take like a couple days.   [54:28] How long like for the month to month cuz I know it's 3 months you said you correct 90 days. You guys usually tell them like month one two and three as far as like the like expected results like expectations.   [54:45]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "90-Day Delivery Timeline"   NÚMEROS:  Semana 1 (KPIs de launch), Semana 2 (primeiro custo por call lucrativo + primeira venda), Semana 3 (escala)   VISUAL:  Timeline de 90 dias dividida em marcos semanais, KPIs específicos por semana, fase zero-to-one destacada   [54:48] Yeah. I mean for for us it's like okay week one we need to make sure the launch like it's hitting KPIs like and I'll give them the exact KPIs that we're trying to hit.   [55:00] And then like week two we're going for like our first like very profitable cost per calls and and hopefully our first sale because again this time compression that we've set up has allowed us to compress results very quickly.   [55:15] And then from there huh okay and then from there uh the last part is like okay week three then we're obviously like lining up and you know we'll just we'll just kind of like like basically let them know the hardest part is zero to one which is getting your first two p uh predictable profitable sales.   [55:35] Unless they're already running ads then then it's like okay just let us plug in and you guys are going to be getting almost instantaneous.   [55:45] So your time collapse framework since implementing it. Can you talk through some of the specific questions you ask yourself about a situation in order to achieve that? Like you can go through a little bit more of that process.   [56:00]  📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ─────────────────────────────  TEXTO:  "Time Collapse Implementation Process"   NÚMEROS:  7 dias, 90 dias, 2 componentes (Mindset + Skillset)   VISUAL:  Processo de pensamento estruturado, análise de gap entre identidade atual e futura, identificação de crenças a mudar   [56:02] Yeah. So it's thinking time. If you haven't deployed it um like in that way, but you're basically saying, hey, if I had seven days, what are the like if I had seven days to accomplish my 90-day goal? Get in my head. I had to do it.   [56:20] What are the beliefs set? Like what do I need to change in terms of like my mindset and skill set? Break that into two parts. Start out with limiting beliefs.   [56:32] Don't focus on limiting beliefs. Just focus on like what beliefs like what like focus on the the goal. The goal define the beliefs that that goal has and see where the discrepancy is.   [56:48] And and it's it's like these three things I need to these three things I need to get rid of. This one thing I need to add to and just like assess your future self against yourself now. So that you can do that.   [57:02] Nick, we we'll we'll talk about it after. Jeremy Jeremy wants me to get off. Yeah.
