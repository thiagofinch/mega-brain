So someone offered me an hourly contract for 150 bucks an hour, I'll take that. E-commerce company wants me to like run their Instagram ads for 2K a month, I'll take that.'"
[03:05]
"Um, and the thing at the beginning is that there's two core things. Um, one that you're thinking too small. So like my goal at the beginning was like, how do I make a million bucks? and a million bucks isn't that much. Um, and so the goal was then pushing down how I thought about my price, how I thought about my value, how I thought about scaling my business."

[04:40]
"And then you're trying to figure out what am I going to deliver and how am I going to price it. Um, and so a lot of people end up being in this stage for quite some time because you can't find a repeatable offer that you can deliver to customers repeatably."

[05:20]
"That became like my target customer inside of this phase. You really want to figure out who is the ICP? Who's my target customer? Who's my perfect ideal client as Jeremy calls it. Um, and so for me at this stage it was a B2B SAS company and it gets more specific over time at least series A which means they've raised at least 5 million bucks."

[06:20]
"One of the things on the mindset of why people get stuck here as well, um, at some point I decided if I'm going to build a big business, I need people. I think a lot of people in this room are reluctant to hire people and bring people onto your team because you want to have that money for yourself or you don't want to be responsible responsible for somebody else's income or because you don't have confidence that you can continue to get business and grow revenue."

Your business is at a specific point where if you don't fundamentally change something in the business and it's usually just one thing then you'll get stuck there forever."
[07:50]
"For me at 70k a month and six people it was I need I need a COO. I'm a salesperson, a marketer, a product person, but I'm not out here. I don't I can't run the operations. I don't want to manage a big team. I don't want to do recruiting and HR and all this other shit"

"Um and so at about closer to like 1.2 million a year, so like 90 100k a month, um I hired a business partner and that's what got me out of uh I brought on a business partner and that's what got me to phase two."
[08:30]
"Let's see if we can move this. How do you do this, Jeremy? Maybe. Yeah, there we go. So, the breakthrough here to phase two was hiring a business partner. When I did this, um there was a woman named Megan um that had worked at tech companies for a while and kind of had some entrepreneurial DNA."
[08:50]
"And so, I didn't just like give her 10% of my company. She actually bought 10% of my company at that time at a $3 million dollar valuation. She gave I put $300 $300 grand in my bank account. Um being in business for about 18 months."
[09:10]
"So she bought 10% of the company off of me at that point. Um that person, she is still the COO today. She's heavily long-term invested. We've had a lot of ups and downs, but we're both basically in this together to get rich."
[09:25]
"And so I think a lot of people get romantic about having 100% ownership of their company um when in reality giving a little bit of that or selling it to people or using it as a way to raise money and inject capital into your company to give away 5% or something like that can often be a good buy as long as those people don't fuck up your business or have too much control."
[09:50]

[11:10]

[12:15]
"Hundreds of people came to the live event during COVID because people didn't have stuff to do. Then it was a podcast. Then it was video content for LinkedIn and this like very strong flywheel that I had created."
[12:30]
"I did I still do those Tuesday episodes today. Four years later, a lot of people might have gotten a little thing and then said, 'Oh, Tuesday at 7:30, I don't really like this time. Maybe I won't do this anymore.' Um, I did more than I've gone pot committed to that strategy."

[14:10]

[14:45]
"And so it's a different approach to sales and marketing that allow that um allows me to scale in like a very much a oneto many scenario instead of a onetoone.

It's very unlikely that they're going to say, 'I'm going to give you 10% of that for your work.' So, we haven't figured out how to get a revenue share model working yet."

And so there's a lot of complexity in how you do that."
[16:25]
"One of the big lessons for me especially when you scale this fast um let's say let's just talk through the scale phase for a second. So this was summer summer 2020 to like Jan 22. So we're talk I guess this is another 18 months."
[16:45] 📊 HIPERCRESCIMENTO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Hyper-Growth Phase Problems"

So 250 to 300k added uh MR every single month. Um and what happens when you scale that fast? Fuck shit breaks."
[17:15]
"Um, shit breaks. It was a huge learning for me. Um, and so stuff broke. What broke? Like we had no process. We had no quality control. People weren't accountable to outcomes."
[17:30]

[18:15]
"Those customers then work with the team. It lowered morale of the team. We had fast churn. That word of mouth happened. You lower acquisition. We got stuck in this little trap for a while."
[18:30]
"Um, a big lesson to me on that is that in this phase I was convinced that the solution was for me to get out of the work, for me to get out of sales and for me to like and what happened was I got so far away from customers and so far away from those types of things um that it caused some challenges for us."

[19:20]
"So, we were running 1.8 million a month and making like 50 100k a month in profit because of all the headcount and the hiring and things like that. It was a huge lesson for me here."

Um, and but the the key is that like I almost like I got to own that stuff. I got to be accountable. I created these own issues for myself."
[21:05]
"Um and so inside of phase three, it was really about rebuilding, optimizing for those uh key metrics. It's really what we should have done in phase one, right? So this is a big learning like you should really have this locked in um rebuild."

Uh, do I want to keep it at 100K a month with no employees and make 100K a month with with no expenses effectively?"
[23:00]
"Understanding what you want to do and looking at that at a long-term window becomes really important. And so what we wanted to do was to build the agency which then creates a lot of cash flow which then allows us to invest and build products which then we build products and we sell the products at a 10 to 20x multiple on revenue to like a technology vendor or someone like that."
[23:25]

[24:35]
"And so yeah, so a lot of the money that was supposed to like I could put in my pocket was actually being reinvested. It's another learning. If I could go back, I would have taken more out of the company as we were growing. Um I can talk someone probably has a questions on that. I have a good perspective on it at this point."
[24:55]
"But yeah, we built uh the product. It's at the uh currently an info product. In a month, we're going to have a Salesforce integration. It'll integrate with Salesforce and run analytics and be like a true like software product and then we can use it for tech enabled services."

[25:35]
"Um, and so a lot of money is being reinvest reinvested back in the company. Um, and we're not making a ton of margin and cash flow. And at some point you're like, 'Wow, I have $600,000 a month in expenses and I have $600,000 in the bank for my business. Like, if something goes wrong, we're fuck going to run out of money. I need some oper working or operating capital.'"
[26:00]
"Um, the first one we use is called a company called Pipe. It's kind of like Stripe Capital. It's good if you're like less than 2 million in revenue and you run on Stripe. Um, and only only good if you know that you can use that money to grow revenue fast."
[26:20]
"Like, so I knew that I was going to pay them 15% interest over a year and that my business was going to grow 300% during that time. And so it was very easy to make that type of investment. If you don't think you're going to grow at the rate of the interest, then it's not worthwhile."
[26:40]
"Um, then we converted that debt into uh MEZ debt and we took out a $4 million uh debt in 2022. That was a lot for product development and operating cash flow at 12% interest."
[26:55]
"Um the key really here is that um if you're going to use debt, understand what the interest payments are under basically look at it the same way you would do a real estate deal. It's very simple like how much am I going to get in the money? What how much cash flow can I produce because of that debt? What's my interest payment? Am I going to be able to cover that? Is it worth doing?"
[27:20]
"So h simplifying the debt to more of like a can I use this money to make more money um is really helpful. And then I probably have a couple couple other points here and then I think we'll get into questions."

[27:40]
"Um I mentioned vetting clients. Like I think that the number one thing in terms of the big learnings for me was that like scaling revenue doesn't really help in our business if pe customers don't stay."
[27:55]
"Um and so there was a point where like our average customer would stay like for six to eight months and we like wasn't a sustainable business model. So you're always trying to replace a customer. Um now we're back up. Our customer lifetime is about 17 months right now which is a lot more acceptable and something that you can scale on."
[28:20]
"Um we talked about the northstar like having the right north star in terms of how you make decisions in your business. What are you optimizing for? At one point for me it was headcount and topline revenue thinking about it differently. Now I reflect and think about cash flow and IBIDA and customer lifetime value or customer happiness."
[28:45]
"Um, I think my situation's pretty unique in how I decided to use the agency to build a product. I think that's a interesting model that I think other agency owners will adopt over time because effectively what you're doing in your agency could be automated and scaled into a product almost immediately if you have some type of core process or IP. Um, so I think that becomes something that's really interesting that people could take advantage of."

"Maybe I have one more point here. I didn't really talk about this much, but I think that it could bring a lot of value to people and then I'll do some closing and we can get into questions. Um, but I have here written down and it's something that I want to cover like the the idea of dominating your space, whatever the space is."
[29:40]
"For me, it's like B2B SAS. How do you become the most most known in that industry for a certain thing? How are you clearly defining that ideal customer profile? How are you creating a marketing engine so that everybody knows you?"
[30:00]
"Um, I think that going in uh going into a specific place with the mindset of I'm going to be the best in this thing was some one of the core drivers as to why I continue to produce the podcast, why I create so much structure around the things that I'm doing."
[30:20]
"Um, and so I think that like mindset overall is a key driver in how you think about getting to a million a month. If you don't think that you can be the best somewhere, if you don't think that you can do that, I think that sometimes you can get uh a little bit caught."
[30:40]
"Um, and so these were some like a lot of good lessons and a lot of other things that I've learned along the way that I want to try and help you all see. Um, to me personally, like some of the I've only had a couple situations in my entire career where like um you have to make that mistake for yourself and you have to feel how fuck bad it feels to actually learn it."
[31:05]
"So, I'm trying to like tell you this so that you don't have to feel it yourself. But, there were basically two in my entire career. one, I was doing e-commerce companies and I was like spending money like an idiot and then I couldn't fund my next purchase order for a hundred grand because I bought a car and I went out of business um because I could well we you didn't lose money, you just don't make the purchase order, you don't make any more money."
[31:35]
"Um and the second one was how I like sort of pushed sales off to the side and then created that sort of like loop where you bring in a lot of bad customers and they churn. Um and those were the two big uh overall learnings for me."

"Um, as we pu as we push forward, my goal is over time to have the agency business basically stay at around 800k a million a month with six teams. So, I'm not scaling headcount over there. All of the revenue growth is going to come from the products and then over time the products will overtake that and I'll probably sell package and sell the agency and then build the product company."
[32:25]
"So, that's the goal overall and how you think about it. Um, so yeah, there was a bunch in there that was good and some of the learnings. would love uh we could have like a I don't know we probably have a bunch of time to do questions so if you guys learned anything or wanted to dive deep we'd love to answer them. Let's do it."

[32:45]
"Do do you view a million a month is a lot of money."

"10 uh $100 million total aggregated equity you said not cash uh I mean you could just look at it as like net worth but $100 million is my target your goal to sell for that though uh the goal is to build the software product to5 or $10 million and sell on a 10 to 12x revenue multiple so somewhere between 60 and $100 million exit"
[33:30]
"keep the agency for cash flow or do you believe that you're going to exit that soon um there's some acquirers that would buy them together, but most likely they'll require us to split it. Um, I would only like in the future if I sold that company only continue to keep the agency if someone else was operating it, but we'll keep it for the C. We're definitely going to like keep trying to have it do like 800k a million a month. Yeah."

[34:10]
"Yeah. Um, excuse me. Yeah. Because um from 2022, like in January 2022, I had uh built a $20 million run rate business and like on paper didn't have anything to show for it except for the value of the business. Like I didn't have a nest egg of a bank account. I didn't have some big investment account."
[34:35]
"all of the stuff that I was doing, the cash that I could take, I was paying myself 200k a year with a $20 million business and just investing it back, trying to build the biggest company possible. Um, and it was extreme. And I wish if I went back, I would have had it be more balanced where I was taking more money out."
[34:55]
"So now at this point, um, I make 10% of revenue every single month. And then there's a any IBIDA or profit that I take, I take quarterly and we typically take 50% of IBIDA quarterly out of the business as well."
[35:15]
"Um, so that that's sort of like the funding mechanism for how I pay myself now versus how I used to. So if I'm able to grow revenue from a million to 1.5, my income's going up as the business goes up. So I basically become like performance incentivized. Yeah."
[35:35]
"Go ahead, Omar. said, 'Okay, this is not working. I should focus more on.'"
[35:45] 📊 ESCOLHA DE NICHO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "How to Choose Your Niche"
NÚMEROS: 3 critérios principais
VISUAL: Framework de seleção: magnitude do problema, nível de competição, match canal-demografia
[35:50]
"Uh, so I would break it down into like three um three areas. So the first one is trying to quantify the magnitude of the problem and solve more expensive problems. Um, and so when you look at like a direct to consumer e-commerce company that I was working with that was willing to pay $2,000 a month for me to run their Instagram ads versus a B2B SAS company that's already spending $5 million a year on marketing and fuck it up and wasting a million dollars in Google ads, their their problems were far more expensive."
[36:25]
"Um, and so that became one thing is try to solve more expensive problems for companies that have more money. That's another part of Jeremy's ideal client. Like we want people that have big pockets that want to solve big problems."
[36:40]
"Um, I think like trying to assess the level of competition is another part of it. And so like um most people in this room are focused like e-commerce or some some form of that. And I know I knew that it was so competitive and there's people that are offering that service for 2k a month and I want to charge more than 2k a month."
[37:05]
"there's going to be there's like a very it's a high competitive set. When I moved into B2B, there was like almost no competition for what I was doing. Um, and so be or they were like legacy like uh holdings company level agencies that are just doing like basic same shit they've been doing since 2012. So having a really interesting space where there's not a lot of competition helped a lot as well."
[37:35]
"Um, and then third, there was just a match between the marketing channel that I was crushing on and that customer demographic. And so um like all from like 30k a month forward like every single company that was coming to us was a B2B SAS company."
[37:55]
"And so we just also found that as a trend like hey we have me problem product message market fit like all those different things were happening for us. Um and then we said fuck it to all these other like these other companies try and work with us. We're not doing it. We only work with companies that and then those types of companies were willing to pay three, five or even 10x more than like some of the other companies we were working with. So willingness to pay based on the size of the problem was high too."
[38:30]
"Yeah. Go ahead, Nick. Um what type of services are you providing these? I imagine ads and stuff like that."
[38:40] 📊 SERVIÇOS OFERECIDOS ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Service Breakdown"
NÚMEROS: CRM Analytics: ~$250K/mês, Advertising: ~$250K/mês, Content & Creative: ~$200K/mês, Produto: ~$300K/mês, pacote total: $25-60K/mês por cliente
VISUAL: Portfólio de serviços, bundling forçado, upsell estratégico
[38:45]
"Uh yeah, so if you break it into like the different like services that we offer, we do CRM analytics. We do about a quarter million a month on CRM analytics. Um we have advertising which is another about a quarter million a month. Uh content and creative does about 200. Um and then the rest is in the product."
[39:10]
"But the the core services are CRM, analytics, advertising and content and creative and then we force companies to buy all of them together so that we have like more control over the outcome and they end up paying us somewhere between 25 and 60,000 a month."
[39:30]
"Gosh, that's broke up into like two or three different segments essentially uh to make up that monthly. Exactly. Yeah. We basically started with advertising and then built other things that we could cross-ell and bundle together so that we could get more revenue per customer."
[39:50]
"Sahil sounds good. So when you hit that cycle that vicious circle of you kept actually getting yourself further and further out of the business. Yeah. And then you just end up going worse and worse. How did you ask like how did you get yourself out of that situation in the sense of the motivation versus the temptation just be like, 'Fuck it. I'm turn it all down. I'm going to move on something entirely different.'"
[40:20]
"Um, so as much as it sucks, like it's hard to be like, I'm going to shut down my $1.4 million a month business. Um, so as uh Yeah, but it was just a it was like the clear business model was we just need we we grew costs way out of line with revenue. If we correct cost, the business model makes sense again. So there wasn't a lot of like we're going to like we should give up."
[40:50]
"Um, but the unlock, which was not obvious while I was doing it, was going back and selling the deals myself, working on some customers myself, so I know what the fuck going on. I know like what the difference between what we're doing as a whole team versus what I would do and see those differences."
[41:10]
"So, it wasn't obvious to me. We basically fired our whole sales and marketing team, which then forced me and my business partner to do it again. And that's when everything started working again. And that was in January of 23."
[41:25]
"So basically go back to the fundamentals all the things again to kind of figure out. Yeah. And being like we scaled something that like doesn't fit the market anymore. Let's go back and then let's build back up."
[41:40]
"Um was the strategy that we took. And then when we were building back up, we built smarter and saying we're going to get a lot of the we're going to grow a lot of revenue over product which is way more scalable. We're going to make 92 78 to 92% gross margin on the product sales. It's way more profitable than our agency stuff that we make like 52% on."
[42:05]
"Um, and so just being like using it as a reset to be a lot more strategic of like what is the growth plan from 14 million a month to 50 or 14 million a year to 50 million a year. Um, so that's sort of how we approached it."
[42:25]
"Yeah. And then you can come back. Cool. Dude, Chris, I'm exactly where you are in phase two. like we're in like this perpetual plateau between 600k to like 700K of Q4 back down to 600K. We've been stuck there. So I felt really triggered when we were talking which is obviously like great."
[42:50]
"I have a couple questions for you. The first one is I've been feeling that same symptom where you know we grew the business from like four people up to an insane amount of people now. You know we've blown our cost right. Mhm. Same with me."
[43:10]
"and so I've been feeling like we're too far away to where our product is good but we felt like over the time it's not best at so we feel like innovation used to happen from the bottom up because we were actually on the tools and now innovation is coming from the top down like push the team to innovate so like how do you solve that innovation piece where you feel like your team is innovating but it's naturally happening with everyone on the shop floor"
[43:40]
"how many people do you have okay so we have a big supports in the Philippines which inflates the numbers. Okay. So it's 80 people and but that's like 40 people in the Philippines. Okay. So like around a half a million a month with 40 full-time like US employees. Yeah. Um what do you think the issue is? Do you think it's lack of innovation? I don't think that's actually it."
[44:10]
"Well, so what we're doing right now is we grew our business off running ads frankly. Like that's our business. And so uh That's a diversification problem. So our big focus right now is cons. We think it's more control over our lead pipeline to better quality clients because clients that come through ads are in a typical range of quality. Right. Okay."
[44:40]
"So that's one countermeasure doing right now. But the other piece too is is I feel like you where I've been feeling for some time that the best people in our company aren't the ones actually doing the work anymore cuz we've grown. Mhm. So, I've been feeling the need that we get back and the tools have the best people on the shop floor again."
[45:05]
"But some guru talk, oh no, like that's a a false belief like you have to stay out of the business to work out business. But like I feel me that the strength is actually being in the business. What do you want the outcome? Then my last question back to you and then I'll give you my answer. What do you want the outcome to be?"
[45:30]
"uh frankly is to have to pick up our pace of innovation frankly because like everything evolves. We do commerce everything evolves and I think the rate of innovation is like really good lit test of us in our building worldass product."

[45:55]
"So uh my goal in my service is to deliver a super premium product that delivers super premium results at a super premium price. Like so people that are like deciding between us and someone else, there's like usually a 5x cost difference between that what they're doing versus what I'm doing. And I'm totally cool with that."
[46:20]
"Um and but in order to deliver a super premium product, you need super premium people, right? Um and so when you think about your ecom, like you have some like junior ad person running and fuck Jeremy's over there running the ads again and that's your competition."
[46:40]
"Um, and so I think if you want to deliver at that level, not a commodity service that you charge whatever two to $5,000 a month for at scale, um, that you need to have like top top actual people in the work, including yourself."
[47:00]
"Um, and that's like I drive all the innovation in my company. People will make micro innovations and like, hey, we'll run this ad or we'll calculate this metric or things like that, but like the big sort of strategic moves always come from my brain and they only come from doing the work with customers."
[47:25]
"And so it's not re uh it's not really top down when you do it that way. It's that you're doing it with everyone. So everyone is giving me the insights of like what's not working or where they waste their time or what that type of stuff. But then I actually end up figuring it out with them about what we're going to do."
[47:50]
"Um so I like at your situation like it feels like the real move is to like get your cost back in line so you have a good amount like a good amount of profit. Again, it also is crazy when you go from like 80 people to 40 people, how much faster you move."
[48:10]
"Um, we were so fuck slow. It was almost impossible to change the service cuz you have like you depend on like 80 people changing the way that they do things."
[48:25]
"Um, yeah. How did you cut those costs? Like we we cut 300k in overheads so far this year. Great. Already like the head count like how did you make those decisions going from your count down to 45? That's like that's half"

[48:50]
"Yeah. So, we did uh two layoffs which were like some of the worst days of my professional career. Um I laid off like 35 people last July and then another 20s something in January. Um and that was all based on like those were mostly people that were delivering work that we just didn't have work for anymore."
[49:20]
"Um, and then over the past like nine months, I've been getting rid of expensive n like uh fixed overhead costs mostly like our CFO that was $400,000 that we hired when things were going great. Our chief revenue officer was $350,000 and getting rid of those types of costs as we like bring it back in line."
[49:45]
"Um, and that's where like the the decisions that I made is like, would I rather have this person in my company for $120,000 or the $120,000 I'd rather have in my pocket? And that's the decision I've looked at people and started making those decisions."
[50:05]
"And if you think about it like that, there's probably a lot of people in there that you'd rather have the money in your pocket than paying them. So, um, that that's what I I would think I would recommend getting back into the work."
[50:20]
"Another thing that's happened is like the market has changed a lot in the past two years. So like what we did in January 2022 would everyone bought where a SAS company would come in and they'd be spending a million dollars a month on ads already. That same company spends 100k a month on ads now."
[50:45]
"Um and so our like the the percent of budget and how much budget spent on those things is going down. Therefore the amount of money they spend on the agencies to support those things has gone down a lot too. And so we've tried that's why CRM analytics is picking up us for us a lot right now."
[51:10]
"Um, so trying to figure out how to get out of like find other value ads to get out of advertising, whether that's products or services, I think could be a good idea, too. Let's chat a little bit after. I'd love to learn more and help you. Yeah."
[51:30]
"Can you talk more about your team breakdown? You mentioned you had 16 teams managing four clients each. How did you come to build that team structure rather than the standard marketing department, content department? And what role do you think that played in increasing your lifetime value? I imagine you're able to look at each individual team and their performance of the clients a lot easier with that kind of setup, right?"

"Um, so how do I explain this? In our delivery model, there's basically one person that's sort of like the orchestrator. Um, and then there's a paid media person, there's a copywriter, designer, creative director type of person. Um and then there's like anal analytics."
[52:30]
"Um and so the scale of our company actually depends on this person. Um and so what we were trying to do is like and we these people are unique and hard to hire. And so what we were trying to do is increase the amount of revenue that this person manages um by cross-selling other services like this where like this team is probably doing like 150k MR"
[52:55]
"um and so that and then you try and take that as one team and you replicate 16. So you have four teams reporting into one VP who reports into one CRO and you build that up. The problem is that you create so many middle management layers in between that the people making the decisions versus the people that doing the work are so far away."
[53:25]
"Um and so that like that was what we did but it didn't really work for us. Um so and the like um as like I mentioned before as a company who wants to like be innovating have a premium service and things like that you like it almost lends itself to having less headcount with much more talented people than scaling out."
[53:50]
"Like if you're looking to build the 500 person agency, you need to have like a $50,000 person that just like focuses on doing this one thing and they have like a little quality control like I need my CPC in this range or something like that. And we don't do work like that. So it's tough to scale without like controls at that level. It's tough to scale a model like this."
[54:20]
"Yeah. Go ahead either one of you. So what did you do instead? like um you said this model didn't work for you. What specifically how does it look because I'm like a visual person."

Uh, no, I'll tell you the thing that didn't work was four teams roll up to one VP, and then four more teams roll up to one VP, and then these VPs roll up to one person, and this person rolls up into Megan, then Megan rolls up into me, and then all of a sudden there's six people between me and the people down here that are like the paid media person."
[55:15]
"Um, and the with that many people, you need to have like some type of management layer, otherwise it's like really hard to control. But the distance between me and my business partner and the work was what didn't work."
[55:30]
"And so what's working now is that we just have six teams that roll up into one person who rolls up into Megan and then me and Megan are there. So we went from like six management layers to two or three much closer to the work."

[56:30]
"um you probably don't need to do this for like until you're at like a at a scale of like 50 hundred or more people where you're building a company where there's like a real exit potential. So as we I never gave away equity when we were a pure services."
[56:50]

[57:55]
"Um, and gener like it's not like the people that I let go sucked. It's just that the structure of the business and the business model wasn't great. I actually most people were really good."
[58:10]
"Um, and so um, in terms of the hiring process, one is identifying who are you trying to hire. Um, so like for our main that role I had in like the nucleus, the main person like that person we're hiring out of a B2B SAS company."
[58:30]
"Um, and so for that person, they were really difficult to recruit. We actually had a recruiting firm that would go out and get those people and we'd pay $25,000 every time we hired someone like that because that was the point of that was the only way we scaled was getting more of those people."
[58:55]
"Um on the other roles typically like the functional leader um whether it's creative or media or uh demand dimension is what we call like the main orchestrator those people are the ones that are vetting the talent and those people are all aligned to me and Megan in terms of like culture and value and overall talent."

"One of the couple things that we do that I think has helped us a lot is like for paid media people or for the people that are orchestrating everything we first make them do like an inplatform assessment."
[59:35]
"It's a second part of the interview where like for one of these people, we either give them a Google ads like instance or a Salesforce dashboard and say, 'Tell me what you see in this thing. How do you check? What's your process? What are you looking at? How do you decide what things are working and what's not?'"
[59:55]
"And if people don't know what they're talking about, they're going to fuck fail. They're going to crack like cheap glass. Um, so a lot of people get weeded out just like that of just putting them in the in the job that they're going to have to do with us and then seeing whether they know what they're doing or not."
[60:20]
"And the third part is we do a lot of like customerf facing stuff and how our team shows up is critically important to whether our customer wants to pay us a lot of money every month."
[60:35]
"Um and so we do a like a basically a client-f facing simulation as the final part every single time where they're presenting on their core function a readout. So there's like a project and they're presenting the project as if we're the client."
[60:55]
"Um and we we look for executive presence and their ability to communicate ideas clearly and other things like that in the process. How are you finding? So obviously you mentioned the lynch part of it that one. Yeah. Um the people who you consider who how are you finding how are you finding? Are you just posting on"
[61:20] 📊 SOURCING DE TALENTOS ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Talent Sourcing Channels"
NÚMEROS: 50K+ ouvintes de podcast, job ads no LinkedIn desde 2-3 pessoas
VISUAL: Inbound de talentos via podcast/LinkedIn, poaching estratégico de agências específicas
[61:25]
"Most people find us? Um so not like the LinkedIn podcast events that I do that give us like tens of millions of dollars in revenue every year. It works just like for hiring, too. It's like on the podcast, they'll say, 'Hey, we have three jobs open. Here are the people that we're hiring for. Here, why these jobs are cool.'"
[61:50]
"And then all of a sudden, 50,000 people listen to that podcast. Someone's thinking, 'Hey, my job sucks anyway. This company seems cool.' And then we get we get like a lot of inbound through that."
[62:05]
"And then we Yeah, we post typical LinkedIn job ads as well. And we've been doing LinkedIn job ads since we were like two or three people um and generally get a good response there."
[62:20]
"And then one thing that we had that worked at one point but then didn't work um was we would just poach people from specific agencies that we knew were big that we that the people were good and they were underpaid."
[62:35]
"So we would find agencies that have good paid media people. They pay them 60 grand. We offer them 80 like we know that they make that much. We offer them 80 grand and they come and work for us and we got like five people that way."
[62:55]
"Um then we Yeah, thank you dude. Um we got like a cease and desist from them at one point where they're like stop fuck stealing our people. So we stopped."
[63:10]
"Yeah, I'd love to. Forgive me considering I don't know your background as well as that's cool. When you were deciding to build out your horizontal, did you do that only because you were trying to build a hedge to prevent cash flow like previous when we shifted more to the focus on product?"
[63:35] 📊 MOTIVAÇÃO PARA PRODUTO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Why Build Product"
NÚMEROS: Múltiplos de receita muito maiores, margens brutas muito maiores (78-92% vs 52%)
VISUAL: Razões multifacetadas: paixão pessoal, múltiplos financeiros, escalabilidade, defensabilidade
[63:40]
"Um I I think that it's like multifaceted. one was like I'm a product person myself. So like it was always part of the goal to build the product. It just took like three years to actually fund it."
[64:00]
"Um in addition to that there's a lot of like logical reasons why you would start to scale that up. The revenue multiples are much higher. Gross margins are much higher. Scalability is much higher."
[64:15]
"Um, and so if you like have the juice to like invest that much money and time to build the product, um, then there's a lot of reasons why you would try to scale revenue over there or try to push customers over to that even though the top line may be lower, but the margin and scalability are way higher."
[64:40]
"Um, and so that's what we've been working on knowing that the transition will take like I don't we've been working on it for 18 months and the product does like 300k a month right now. So three four million in revenue."
[65:00]
"Um, and so being able to get like keep going on that where effectively if the agency fell apart, we'd still have like a 12 the same amount of revenue, $12 million run rate business is what we're working toward. It'll probably take us like several more years to actually get there. And then you have like the thing that you can actually sell."
[65:25] 📊 REALIDADE DE VENDA DE AGENCY ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Agency Sale Challenges"
NÚMEROS: Baixos múltiplos de receita/EBITDA, 20% upfront típico, 2-3 anos de earnout
VISUAL: Dificuldades de exit: pouco cash upfront, você vira empregado, earnouts longos
[65:30]
"Um, selling an agency, at least in my experience so far, is like pretty hard. Um, typically you don't get a lot of money up front. Um, with Revshares, it can get complicated. People want you to earn it out."
[65:50]
"So they're going to give you like 20% of the payment up front and then they're going to make you earn out the rest over two or three years. So you basically become an employee for a long time. The revenue multiples and eBay multiples are pretty low."
[66:10]
"Um so those are some of the reasons why I've like sort of had that strategy all along. Um but I it really comes down to what you want to do. Like that was it was really more about like what business did I want to build? And it was really a product company but using a different funding mechan or a more creative funding mechanism to get there."
[66:35]
"Of course all right I think Jeremy's going to kick me off in a sec but Omar one more Omar. Okay cool ask. So just I want to just clarify last few years did about 40 million right um from 2021 till the end of this year projected it'll be like 32 million or something like that for three years. Yeah."
[67:00] 📊 RECEITA TOTAL 100% INBOUND ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Total Revenue Attribution"
NÚMEROS: ~$32M em 3 anos (2021-2023), 100% inbound, 0% outbound
VISUAL: Validação do modelo de marketing, ROI do conteúdo comprovado
[67:05]
"And more than 98 or 90% of that came from inbound deals. Correct. Uh 100% of it inbound. Yeah. So can you please talk us through um your process in terms of how you use that marketing as as a flywheel to get insights to form your your SAS products you're building and everything"
[67:30]
"because at least from my perspective I help I've met multiple people in the industry where either they they're employee or potential customer and they want to do business or work for final assets specifically because of you because they know that they're going to get better just by engaging you. Can you talk about the content that you develop process for that?"
[67:55] 📊 FLYWHEEL DE CONTEÚDO DETALHADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Content Flywheel Process"
NÚMEROS: 40-200 participantes por evento ao vivo, 5K views YouTube long-form, milhares de vídeos nunca postados
VISUAL: Ciclo completo: Live Event → Podcast → YouTube longo → Short-form (LinkedIn/TikTok/Reels) → Feedback → Insights → Novo evento
[68:00]
"Well, it's part of the secret sauce for sure. Um, okay. So, the first thing is like a live event. That's the starting point. Um, so the first thing that we did whether it's virtual or in person like we're recording this like this might go on my podcast. It's already being recorded. I'm already doing it. Maybe it'll go on."
[68:25]
"But you start with a live event that gets recorded. People show up to the event. So like somewhere between 40 and 200 people end up showing up to the events that I have."
[68:40]
"Um I talk about stuff that I'm seeing in real life because I work with customers. So every single time I'm talking about something it's incredibly relevant and something that I learned last week or something like that."
[69:00]
"Then so I get to put my own point of view out which is basically what that point of view is for. Here's what I would say to my prospective customers. So it's like me reporting to prospective customers at the first half of the podcast and then people are asking questions back where I'm basically doing free consulting that people would pay a lot of money for."
[69:25]
"So that's why people come they can ask me questions. When they ask the questions then I get the insights. So I get to understand like what do people want to know? What points that I'm making are not resonating. So it allows me to like change update my perspective about what I'm talking about and why."
[69:50]
"um that event then gets packaged into a podcast and a and a long form YouTube video. Um long form YouTube is not for scale, it's for like depth. So my YouTube videos are getting like 5,000 views, but someone's watching an hourong YouTube video. My podcast is also for depth."
[70:15]
"Um then the long form gets broken up into short form. At the beginning it was just LinkedIn video, but now we do Tik Tok, YouTube shorts. Um, and I'm dabbling in reels."
[70:30]
"So, you have all your like uh short form video platforms where the formatting is different and maybe the length is different, but you're using the same core content to create it. So, I'm not like stopping and making certain videos for this platform on its own. It's like all part of a flywheel."
[70:55]
"Um, through the short form, you're going to get comments, questions, DMs, sales conversations, all this different stuff that give you more insights. then it helps you redo your perspective and you go back into the live event"
[71:15]
"and then so that happens for me I do like one live event and three podcast guests like people ask me to be on their podcast every week um and then I can put out four podcasts"
[71:30]
"I don't have to post every single video that gets created for me so I have like thousands of videos that I've never posted so I can be very selective on what I do post and it creates a little uh creat creates a nice little flywheel if you can figure out how to get it going"
[71:50]
"where like you I don't have to think about my content anymore. And there's like the infrastructure in people where literally the only work I do is I show up to this event and talk about the fuck that I know. So I no prep needed and then I post on LinkedIn."
[72:10]
"Um people other people will post for me on YouTube. Actually I post on Tik Tok too. Other people will post for me on YouTube. People post post the podcast, the YouTube videos, things like that."
[72:25] 📊 INVESTIMENTO DE TEMPO EM CONTEÚDO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Weekly Content Time Investment"
NÚMEROS: 6 horas/semana total de investimento pessoal, motor de aquisição para $105M+ negócio
VISUAL: ROI extremo: 6h/semana → $105M+ em receita total
[72:30]
"So my workload is I invest six hours a week in this and it's like basically our entire customer acquisition engine for like 105 million a year in business."
[72:50]
"I think I missed a small step of those right now. So you had the last event, you repurpose the long form and you repurpose the short form and what's that last step there before you go?"
[73:05]
"It's it's just all of the different stuff that's happening along the way. The com I get a 100 comments on my LinkedIn posts, 100 comments on TikTok, although a lot of them are trash. People will shoot me DMs and say that was super interesting. I have this question blah blah blah."
[73:30]
"And so what people give you back based on the content then feeds like I'll take questions that people send me in DMs and then the next live event I'll just answer those questions and it creates a loop where I don't have to think about what to say every week which I think is what holds a lot of people up."
[73:55]
"It did for me at the beginning like there were at a point where I was like I don't have any fuck shit to write about anymore when I think about a post and now so my my LinkedIn posts are not dependent on me showing up one morning and having some good thought like it's already happening. Cool."
[74:20]
"Yeah. Are you hosting that webinar? Yeah, it's just like what Jeremy does. We record it, people show up. Um, it's on their calendar every week. Let's keep it rolling. I'll go until uh we run out of time. No, no, no. You're good."
[74:40]
"If you're investing six hours in your customer and it's getting the results you're getting does it does it scale much beyond that or you just pointed to"
[74:55] 📊 ESCALA VIA QUALIDADE ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Scale Through Quality Not Quantity"
NÚMEROS: Apenas ~20K empresas no mundo são ICP possível
VISUAL: Insight crítico: relevância > volume, qualidade > quantidade, insights reais > views
[75:00]
"the crazy thing that I've realized especially in the last eight months is that the scale comes from the quality of the content so um like the last six months as I've been back in the work working with customers I get the patterns and insights much faster"
[75:25]
"so the stuff that I talk about on the podcast is much more relevant to what's happening to that company right now and the CMOs that listen to it say like he's saying the exact same thing that's going on in my company. He must know what he's talking about. I'm going to go and talk to him."
[75:50]
"And so it really ends up being the quality and the relevance of the content that's that becomes the scale driver, not how many listeners you have. Especially for me, there's only about 20,000 companies in the world that could be my customer."
[76:10]
"So, it's more about uh like properly impacting them to want to buy from me versus trying to scale to like millions of views a month."
[76:25]
"Yeah. Would you say then that you become an influencer to them, you know, below their awareness because you're a leader in essence because you're close to the customers that they they're making the decision. They're going to increase the convers that's watching. That's"
[76:45]
"Yeah. Yeah. So if you in all of your businesses be uh because you see a lot of companies that are typically similar, you learn faster than a normal company would."
[77:00]
"Um and so because I've worked with more than 250 of these very specific type of companies, they use the same tools. They allocate the budgets the same. They have the same job roles, all the same problems. Like it's very similar. And so that I've been able to see all those patterns."
[77:25]
"And so one like a CMO on the side clearly knows based on what I'm saying and how I say it and the data that I bring to the table that I know what I'm talking about."
[77:40]
"And so the same like if my podcast sucked or my podcast wasn't as strong like in 2022 when I was out of the insights maybe one out of every hundred CMOs that listen comes comes in if the content's more specific maybe six out of a 100red CMOS come in to work."
[78:05]
"So I found that the content quality is actually the most important part. Just one more thing before you started this company. Uh I did marketing at companies like this. Yeah."
[78:20]
"For everybody just just a small piece of advice. Go on LinkedIn all risk. Go look at his video post. Watch the video and then go look at the post and it'll tell you the the level of content you can think about making."
[78:40]
"You read those posts by themselves. They're extremely well made and it's not like surface level fuck content. like those post by themselves. I can send it to a CEO easily and they'll be they'll be influenced by it. It's like really high quality stuff. Thanks, Omar."
[79:00]
"What does your sales process look like? So like they should in"
[79:05] 📊 PROCESSO DE VENDAS ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Sales Process Structure"
NÚMEROS: 3 estágios, 30 dias para fechar $500-600K/ano, 30% close rate, apenas Chris + Megan vendem
VISUAL: Funil de vendas: prospects pré-aquecidos (100+ podcasts ouvidos) → 3 calls → fechamento rápido
[79:10]
"Yeah. So whether a customer comes to our website and says talk to sales or they send me like their DM at the moment me and my business partner are the only people that sell which means that we're going to get customers that have the right expectations that pay the right amount that are on like the right agreements that we want and that we think are going to be successful and stay for a long time."
[79:40]
"So we're really optimizing for having the right customers not selling as many customers as we can. Um our sales process is typically three stages."
[79:55]
"The big difference between like my sales process and maybe some of yours is that like typically when someone's talking to me, they've already listened to a hundred of my podcasts. So, they like really know the way that I think. They use the same terminology as me. They recognize that what I'm doing is very different than what someone else might be doing."
[80:20]
"So, they're not thinking about um I'm not doing all the convincing I do in my content. So, the people that I'm talking to are typically mostly convinced already. sell a five4 to $600,000 a year deal in 30 days."
[80:40]
"Um, three calls, one with just the CMO, second call with like their right-hand person where we collect some information and data. Um, and then the third call for just like procurement stuff."
[81:00]
"So the um the key is thinking about where where in the process are you doing your selling? Like I'd rather do my selling at scale to people in a oneto many motion than trying to onetoone sell people that don't want to buy yet. It's just way more efficient."
[81:25]
"And so we'll close 30% of meetings maybe. Um and generally like if you did had an outbound model it would probably be much lower just because the buyer has a different propensity to buy."
[81:45]
"Um so yeah I think it's about whether whether you want to be heavier in marketing or heavier in sales in how you like get your customers and at what how far down the buying process they are when they start talking to you in sales. Because if they're at zero or 10% you have a much different sales process."
[82:10]
"So you and your partner take sales. Yeah. Yeah. And we found um despite the fact that like a lot of people even I thought that like the number one thing I need to do is get out of sales. Yeah. For sure."
[82:30]
"Um that uh as I've gotten back into it, I recognize how valuable it is for business growth. Um, and so I think that like one of the messages is the longer that you can stay in, especially if you want to be like push forward and innovate and grow, that being in the work as long as you can, um, becomes a it's been really helpful for me."
[82:55]
"We can test new messaging. I can change the price whenever I want. I can change how it's packaged, whether it's on a nine-month contract or a three-month contract or I could like what I found is that another sales rep isn't going to do those things."
[83:20]
"Um so as we keep figuring trying to figure out what is the perfect sort of like product packaging offer that we have for these companies you doing it becomes a great way to test and figure it out and then you have a lot of conviction in it because you've it's not like somebody else did it and it's what they think like you actually did the work you know that it works so you can go with confidence and lead like your team or your company to do it."
[83:55]
"All right we said we got time for one more if anyone has one. Got the last question. What advice do you have of navigating those conflicts with a partner having to reinvent the organization?"
[84:10] 📊 GESTÃO DE CONFLITO COM PARCEIRO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Partner Conflict Management"
NÚMEROS: Incentivos alinhados via equity, ambos perdem se um sair
VISUAL: Conceito de "armas apontadas mutuamente", alinhamento forçado, queimar os barcos
[84:15]
"Yeah, I mean it's it was it's really fuck hard. Um I think that uh that the number one thing that kept it together was having aligned incentives, right? So like it's kind of like you're both holding a gun to one another. If you shoot someone, they're going to shoot you too. Like that's the situation that we were in."
[84:40]
"If either one of us left, we both lose our investment and we basically fuck each other. Um, and so having that align incentive basically had it where like there is no like you burn the boats, there's no way out."
[85:00]
"Um, and so I thought that was actually really helpful when times got tough. We could center back on like why did we do this in the first place? What are we trying to do? What do you want? What do I want? How can we both get what we want?"
[85:20]
"Um, and like Jere there was a lot of like themes in Jeremy's talk that really resonated with me. Like there are very much highs and lows. Like the highs are incredible. like adding three $4 million a year every month in business. Um scaling a team, having like incredible off-site, so many like great highs"
[85:45]
"and then like having to lay people off or like change this strategy or like you don't you're not fitting with what customers need anymore and you have some lows. Um it's just part it's part of the game."
[86:05]
"Um and while it was like pretty hard for me, there wasn't like a lot of um there wasn't a lot of like thinking about giving up. Um, so I think that if you're doing 50k a month and you go through some of those things, you're at sort of like a different you're in a different point. But, um, yeah, that's what I would say."
[86:30]
"Cool. All right. Thanks y'all. I hope that was helpful. Give it up for Chris."
