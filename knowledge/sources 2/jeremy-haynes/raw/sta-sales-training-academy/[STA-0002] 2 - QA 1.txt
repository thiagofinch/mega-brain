Conversa sobre Estruturas de Aquisição de Agências

"Well, so if I do an equity deal, okay, if I do an equity buyout, how do they actually make money and how do I make money? So if I make, you know, a million dollars, like do I split that with them for whatever equity percentage they own or do they—"

[00:18]
"Yeah, great, great point. So think of it this way. When um let's just say that it was a straight equity deal. In this scenario, you would get no cash and you would move over. So they would still give you a deal value. So let's say they were valuing your agency at a million bucks and the current agency was valued at 10 million bucks. Okay? And then you moved over and got one. You got equity, right? A mill your company is worth a million bucks. Theirs is worth 10 million. You would then ultimately have 10% of that new company because you moved over a million. And the hope is at some point when it sells that percentage will be worth more than the million that you initially gave up in equity."

[00:58]
"Do I lose any cash flow in that example?"

[01:01]
"No. No."

[01:03]
"What's what's the difference between a stock deal and an equity deal? I heard you mention that in section."

[01:08]
"So a stock so equity um they're kind of inter interchangeable. I think the big nuance is stock would be you know more than likely like publicly traded, right? Right? So, if a publicly traded company comes in and buys you, you may get shares of a publicly traded stock where equity, if it's a private company, you're still getting ownership, but it's not publicly traded."

[01:31]
"So, when you reference like equity and stock, what you're actually saying is that I'm getting bought out. I'm giving a piece of their— they're How are they giving a piece of my company example? Is that is there a difference?"

[01:44]
"Yeah. So, think of it this way. I'm going to give a uh a private equity and I think everybody, you know, watching this is probably going to be the most um appropriate potential buyer. So, they're going to come in and again, if if we looked at an evaluation and we said your total deal value is 10 million bucks. We think your company is worth 10 million bucks. Now, what we're willing to do is we're going to give you 70% cash. we're going to wire you 70% cash and we want you to roll over 30% of of that. So, you would get a um in that scenario, we say it was 10 million. You would get 7 million wired to your bank account and you would roll over 3 million of real cash as equity into the bigger unit."

[02:31]
"And then at some point, the the goal is to sell again. And if you do it correctly, that 30%, at least in my case, has been bigger than the initial 70% cash that I took."

[02:43]
"That makes sense. So on your second buy out, it was from you having equity in the bigger company that bought you out the first time."

[02:50]
"Yeah."

[02:51]
"And then they sold and that you get a larger chunk even though it's technically a small percentage."

[02:56]
"Yep."

[02:57]
"Totally."

[02:58]
"All right. Uh you mentioned all these different like strategic ways that people can buy you out. Should you position yourself for the for the type of strategic buy you're looking for or do you actually build to like appeal to all these scenarios?"

[03:13]
"Listen, I think you you always should be building a business to sell. Even if you don't want to sell and you just want cash flow, you'd be remissed to not build it to sell. Now, we're going to get into a lot of like niche market leader positioning. And once you hone in and really get, you know, um, tighter in your offering, who your market is, and what you do, then that opens up the door to kind of understand who potential buyers would be at that point and you could shift your strategy a little bit. But listen, if you become niche, you focus on getting EBITDA uh and your margins to 25% plus and start growing a really profitable big company, there's going to be buyers out there."

[03:52]
"Understood. Um can you explain EBITDA to me like on—"

[03:57]
"um think of it as profit? I mean it's it's it's literally um if if you have a million dollar business, right? That's your your revenue, right? And—"

[04:06]
"my gross revenue"

[04:07]
"your gross re it's net, right? your your gross revenue is a million and let's say your net is 200,000. That's that's pretty much what EBITDA is. But what I would highly encourage I mean there's some nuances, right? It is a little bit different. There's some tax things and depreciation. Get with your CPA. We'll include some links in this, but um it it's key. EBITDA learning EBITDA is is fundamental in selling an agency."

[04:35]
"And then if I'm at 1 million or 10 million in EBITDA, really you can make up any number here for this example. Is there a certain amount of staff I need or offices in order to sell or could I theoretically scale up to 10 million with two people and still have an appeal to sell or like what what's actually needed?"

[04:54]
"Great question and and we're going to get into a lot of that, but if you had a $10 million business and let's say it was coming from two clients, you're not going to be able to sell."

[05:04]
"Not two clients per se, but like let's say I have 10 10 clients and two staff."

[05:09]
"Yeah."

[05:10]
"Yeah. Absolutely 100%. But think of it this way. They they want a buyer, right? Just think of it if you were buying something. They want to see scale. If I'm buying it here, I want to know it goes here and I want to see predictability in the revenue and I want to feel like it's safe. So, what I mean by that is the more clients, not it doesn't have to be thousands of clients, but you know, they would much rather see 30 clients each paying you a million bucks for 30 million in revenue versus five clients, you know, all contributing to that 30 million. And then one one last question on this section that I think will appeal to a lot of like the modern day agency owners are so I heard the statistic there's over a billion like remote workers quote unquote. So nowadays theoretically like the type of agencies that are being built are more remote uh they don't necessarily have physical offices but they do have like tight staff together as a team but it's all it's all virtual. Does all this still apply?"

[06:11]
"100%. Listen, I I I believe that is um you know, times are changing. It's a 24/7 economy 365 and the ability to scale and grow and virtual with technology things that we're doing now 100%. You know, fundamentally again, low customer concentration, right? High margins, healthy business, and ability to scale. If you just took those fundamentals, virtual, not virtual, office, multiple offices, you have a high probability of finding a buyer that would be interested in that business."

[06:46]
"Okay, team, that is the end of this Q&A, but listen, please, please, please, there's comments below. There's an area here to put more questions. We're going to have an active Facebook group. I want to try to answer every question you guys have. Take the time, write those questions in. We're going to get to them. We're going to answer them. and I'll see you in the next section."
