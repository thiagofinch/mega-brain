[00:30] Like we've started working with publicly traded companies recently and they do require like certain compliance laws to be acknowledged within the agreement that we didn't have in there.
[00:40] So when they ask that question, it's not like what they're adding is bad or going to change like how we operate. They just have to have something in there that discloses that we're going to follow the compliance regulations for their specific sector since they're a publicly regulated company.
