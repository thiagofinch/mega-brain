[00:02] Okay. So, in sales, one huge thing that makes a big difference to my total ROI, which is when I spend money on ads on behalf of the business you're working for, you know, the amount that comes out the other side matters a lot to how much more money that I can spend to scale the business up with you guys.

TEXTO: "AOV = Average Order Value"

NÚMEROS: $8,000 product, $500-$2,000 collected upfront

VISUAL: Conceito de AOV com exemplo de cliente

[00:25] So, to be clear, we care a lot as marketers about this concept called AOV, average order value. I have a client as an example. He has a $8,000 product, but he typically sells for an average of $500 to $2,000 for the amount that they actually collect upfront.

[00:40] That makes a huge difference for how much more we can spend on the front end to get the sales team even more leads. Because as an example, if it costs, let's say, $500 to get a customer and they're only collecting $500, you can't really scale that.

NÚMEROS: $500 cost per customer = $500 collected

[01:05] You're just making money on the front end and then you have to wait 30 days to actually be profitable, which in fairness is sometimes a great way to run a business. But why not be as profitable as we can on the front end so we can scale the hell out of the business even faster?

TEXTO: "Solution: Incentives Drive Behavior"

NÚMEROS: None

VISUAL: Incentivos controlando comportamento do cliente

[01:25] So to increase the average order value, I like to think it comes down to incentives. We have to give people a reason that they need to take action for a larger amount today.

TEXTO: "Jeremy's $5K Product Example"

NÚMEROS: $5,000 full pay, 2 bonus programs

VISUAL: Estrutura de produto com bônus para pagamento integral

[01:40] So just to be very clear, a few ways to go about doing this. In my business, I have an education company. We have a $5,000 information product. If somebody is willing to buy the full amount at $5,000, they get the most product in comparison to anybody else and they also get it right away.

[01:55] We'll give them not just what program they bought, we'll give them two extra programs as a bonus and we also assure them that they're paying the least in comparison to anybody else.

TEXTO: "Split Pay Penalty Structure"

NÚMEROS: 2 payments of $2,600 = $5,200 total (+$200 tax)

VISUAL: Comparação entre pagamento integral vs parcelado

[02:15] If somebody wants to do a split pay with us, meaning a split pay of two payments instead of just a single payment, that person pays two payments of $2,600. Two payments of $2,600 comes out to $5,200 altogether.

[02:30] So that person's going to get taxed essentially $200 to pay it over the course of 60 days rather than just making a one-time payment. And in addition to that, they will not get any bonus courses that the person who paid 5K gets.

TEXTO: "Incentive Psychology"

NÚMEROS: $200+ penalty for split pay, no bonuses

VISUAL: Psicologia de incentivos controlando decisões

[02:50] So right there alone, if you're in the consideration as a buyer, yeah, I want to buy this, but do I want to pay it all now or am I positioned where I'm cash strapped and I want to do the split pay. Well, if you do the split pay, you're not going to get the two bonuses. And on top of that, you're going to pay a little over $200 more.

[03:10] So, we incentivize the behavior that we want to see from the customers. The incentives control what they're going to do and what they're not going to do. And the incentives have to be powerful enough and the person essentially has to care enough about them to actually want to do whatever you're attempting to incentivize.

TEXTO: "Quad Pay Problems"

NÚMEROS: 4 payments of $1,325 = $300+ tax, high failure rate

VISUAL: Problema com pagamentos em 4x, falhas de cartão

[03:35] Now, at one point in my business, we had a quad pay for that same 5K information product where we split it into four payments of $1,325. That person ended up paying a little more than $300 in total tax to make it over the course of four months.

[03:50] However, the issue with the quad pay is that a lot of those people would make a single payment. Then they wouldn't continue paying. Their card would fail the second, third, and fourth time and they would get removed from the course.

TEXTO: "Better Solution: Financing Partners"

NÚMEROS: $100K-$150K approval capacity, 0% interest, 12-36 months

VISUAL: Parceiros de financiamento: Coach Finance, Finnfi, cartões 0%

[04:10] However, the Quad Pay we got rid of entirely. We introduced financing partners, funding partners. We introduced companies like Coach Finance, Finnfi. We even have funding partners who can help get people approved for 0% interest credit cards where they can then use those to buy that same product.

[04:25] We also like to incentivize the funding or the financing partners that we have because we're still going to get the pay in full. We're still going to get the full $5,000 amount and the person has the opportunity to make 12 payments on it or 36 months worth of payments.

[04:40] We have funding partners and financing partners for our clients that go all the way up to $100,000. As an example, we have one funding partner that can get people approved for 150k on average through those 0% interest credit cards.

TEXTO: "Equal Incentives for Financing"

NÚMEROS: Full $5K received + bonuses maintained

VISUAL: Mesmos incentivos para financiamento vs pagamento à vista

[05:00] Those options are equally as incentivized as just paying it in full with cash. We're still going to give the person the two bonuses and we're also going to give the person the other bonuses that we have in terms of like the discount.

[05:15] So, we're going to make sure that they only pay the 5K plus their interest that they're going to have, but we'll give them the two bonuses since we still get paid the full amount.

TEXTO: "Key Principle: Incentivize Desired Behavior"

NÚMEROS: None

VISUAL: Fórmula: Incentivos corretos = Comportamento desejado

[05:30] So, to be clear, essentially, when it comes to increasing the average order value, there has to be a legitimate reason for why the person's going to be spending more today in comparison to just using your funding options or in comparison to just using your own internal payment plans. Make sure you incentivize the behavior that you actually want to see in the business.
