[00:02] Okay, so in the last video I was just talking about the point our sales people are eventually going to get maxed out. It's mathematically impossible to follow up with everybody, reach out to new daily leads every day and deal with all the scheduled calls we have after several weeks of heightened activity in the business.

[00:25] So what do we do? We introduce the cleaner. The cleaner is one of my favorite roles. Let's say you have some new salesperson starting in your organization. Does that person deserve to just get on the phone and take all the new leads on a day-to-day basis? No. No, they shouldn't.

[00:50] What we're going to instead do is we're going to refer to the new role in your business called the cleaner. Now, the cleaner comes in, they have a very simple job. Remember what I mentioned? Math tells us that our salespeople will get maxed out.

[01:10] In the first week, they should be fine. In the second week, they should be fine. In the third week, this is when they cross the threshold where mathematically they can no longer follow up with everybody from week one and two.

[01:35] They can no longer handle the additional daily leads that come in and they can no longer handle their scheduled calls all at once. Somebody else has to come in and clean up where that person can no longer handle the volume. So, what does the cleaner do? The cleaner's role is very simple. They're going to follow up.

TEXTO: "Volume Multiplication Effect"

NÚMEROS: 1 salesperson = 1x problem, 2 salespeople = 2x problem, 3 salespeople = 3x problem

VISUAL: Multiplicação visual do problema conforme equipe cresce

[02:10] They're going to follow up with as many people as you can imagine. All your salespeople individually have this very scenario happening. So if you have one salesperson, this is happening once. If you have two sales people, this is happening 2x. If you have three sales people, it's happening 3x etc.

TEXTO: "Example: 4 Weeks, 3 Salespeople"

NÚMEROS: Week 1: 100 leads ÷ 3 salespeople = 25 leads per person abandoned

VISUAL: Cálculo matemático mostrando leads abandonados por pessoa

[02:40] So as many sales people as you have, you can essentially multiply the volume of leads that you get per week. Let's say you have three salespeople and you have four weeks of activity, all of the leads from week one are likely not being followed up with in week four.

[03:00] However many leads you got in week one, let's say that's 100 to be simple. You have a hundred leads that have come in split between four salespeople. That's 25 leads per person that are now no longer being communicated to.

[03:25] The cleaner comes in and they are going to follow up with those 100 leads. And then week two comes along. Well, now your closers are operating in week six, but now the week two leads are no longer being followed up with. Here comes the cleaner again.

[03:45] The cleaner's role is to reestablish communication with the people who are no longer being followed up with. And their job is very simple. They are either going to attempt to close those people themselves.

TEXTO: "Cleaner = Closer (Not Setter)"

NÚMEROS: None

VISUAL: Distinção clara entre papel de closer vs setter

[04:05] The cleaner role is typically a closing role. It's typically not a setter. It's okay. I want to point out it is okay if you have some setters that are initially being trained up in the cleaner role. Totally fine.

[04:20] However, in an ideal scenario, remember your main closers no longer have time to deal with all those leads anyway. They're dealing with all the new leads, all their new scheduled calls.

NÚMEROS: None

VISUAL: Transferência de propriedade dos leads para o cleaner

[04:40] The cleaner is ideally a closer because those leads, they're not going to be contacted by the first closer who touched them anyway. So, the cleaner comes in, they take ownership of that lead. They are the ones who are going to be responsible for working all of those old leads.

[06:20] The cleaner can close leads that have directly expressed interest in your business and filled out lead forms very easily. They still count as inbound leads. They're just a little colder. No reason this person can't make a lot of money in what they do.
