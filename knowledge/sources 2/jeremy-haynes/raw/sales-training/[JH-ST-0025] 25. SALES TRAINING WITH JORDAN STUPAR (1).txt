TEXTO: "Jordan Stupar Introduction"

NÚMEROS: 18 months to multi-million dollar company

VISUAL: Apresentação pessoal, Milwaukee Wisconsin

[00:25] But first, real quick, I'm Jordan in case you guys didn't know, we didn't meet, didn't connect yet. I live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I built a multi-million dollar sales training company in about 18 months using some of the things that I'm going to share with you guys today and I'm here to help you crush sales.

[00:42] Jeremy called me. He was like, "Hey, man. You want to come down and you want to speak to my team?" And I was like, "Yes, I do. That would be awesome." So, I'm pumped about this. And I will say I have never done this presentation before. I actually made this from scratch on an airplane.

[01:00] And ultimately, this is going to be the most info I've ever dropped at one period of time. So, if you pay attention and listen carefully, this could very well help you guys print money.

TEXTO: "Cash Cards Product"

NÚMEROS: None

VISUAL: Deck de cartas com objeções de um lado, respostas do outro

[01:15] First and foremost, I started my business and I ended up creating a product that some of you guys have been talking to me about. Some of you guys already have them. It's called cash cards. It's a little deck of cards that has an objection on one side and kind of what to say on the other side.

[01:30] I ended up putting that on my Facebook account, my personal one, and I ended up continuously selling out of these things. So, I started like making them really good and I've been marketing them.

NÚMEROS: ~$250,000 marketing spend, 93% profit margin

VISUAL: Estatísticas de investimento em marketing e margem de lucro

[01:45] I've spent it looks like I don't know close to a quarter of a million dollars marketing this product. The beautiful thing about this product is that I get paid to generate leads. I know a lot of people have a lead form or a VSSL or whatever. And obviously there's a lead acquisition cost there.

[02:05] At the end of the day, this product has been insanely profitable for me. I run about a 93% profit margin on it.

TEXTO: "Revenue Screenshot"

NÚMEROS: Missing second comma due to platform switch

VISUAL: Screenshot de receita com lacuna devido mudança Shopify→WordPress

[02:20] That little blank spot right there. I'm missing out on my second comma on this because I switched off a Shopify into WordPress. That was a horrible mistake. I'll never do that again. But the point is is that it's a profitable lead generation source.

TEXTO: "Lead Generation Focus"

NÚMEROS: 13,414 customers

VISUAL: Foco no número de leads vs apenas receita

[02:40] And while most people look at the revenue number, that's that fancy thing that a lot of ecom people put on their Instagram stories to impress people. I'm busy looking at that number, the 13,414 people, because that's 13,414 people that have raised their hand and said, "I need at least some help when it comes to training objections and closing deals."

[03:00] These are people in every single industry. There's not a single industry that I haven't sold a deck of cash cards to. I've got contractors, HVAC, roofers, solar, SAS, insurance, car dealerships, you name it.

NÚMEROS: None

VISUAL: Múltiplas indústrias atendidas sem nicho específico

[03:20] And at the end of the day, because I don't have any specific niche, I have to figure out how to tailor my presentations and my sales pitch to each one of these different industries, overcome their objections, and ultimately close business.

TEXTO: "Year to Date Results"

NÚMEROS: $1.1 million from existing customers

VISUAL: Receita de clientes que já transacionaram anteriormente

[03:40] But I've done really good at that in the last, this is just year to date from like a couple days ago, done over $1.1 million in sales from people that have already transacted with us.

[03:52] So whether you guys are doing that hydra thing that you learned from Jeremy and you guys are just getting a lead form and people don't really know about your company, they don't really know about your service, they don't really know about your product and you're there to take them from I'm kind of interested in what this is and learning about it.

[04:10] You obviously have to have a process driven approach to getting there.

TEXTO: "Grant Cardone Office Experience"

NÚMEROS: None

VISUAL: Experiência de cold calling no escritório do Grant

[04:20] But one thing I was going to take this slide out, but I think that it's kind of useful. Back in the day when Jeremy met me at Grant's office, I didn't have any leads. I was just like going onto Google, typing in car dealerships Houston, going to the maps, clicking on the blue dot, going to the website, writing down the general manager's name, the phone number, and trying to cold call that person.

[04:45] That's where obviously I have to prove a solution or a problem to somebody and be help them become aware of a problem that they might have. For those of you that have sales teams, that's where all the money is in commission because you're not really providing them with any leads.

[05:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO

─────────────────────────────

TEXTO: "Lead Temperature Spectrum"

NÚMEROS: None

VISUAL: Cold leads → Warm leads → Hot leads → Customers

[05:05] You have to go sell somebody on a problem that they didn't know that they have and simultaneously make them aware of a solution that they didn't know exists and get them to actually do it. So, that's one place to be.

[05:20] Another place to be is warm leads. That's where people are like, "Hey man, I've got a problem. I need more leads or I need more sales training or I need this or that or the other thing." And they become part of where they're actually going to be looking for a solution.

[05:35] Then you have hot leads. These are pretty much the people that I'm calling on with my cash card sales. These are people that are aware of a solution. They see an Instagram or a Facebook ad. They're like, "Hey, I'm going to buy some objection flashcards and now they're considering potentially getting a little bit better using some of that training."

[05:55] And then of course you have all those people turn into customers. Those are people that have solved a problem, purchased a product because we can all agree that the main reason somebody buys something is to solve a problem.

TEXTO: "Process Driven Approach Required"

NÚMEROS: None

VISUAL: Necessidade de abordagem sistemática para qualquer tipo de lead

[06:15] So, with that being said, either way, if you're going to be converting leads, whether it's somebody that is in your VSSL, whether it's somebody that's on your calendar, whether it's a cold call, you have to have a process driven approach.

TEXTO: "Green Bay Packers Analogy"

NÚMEROS: None

VISUAL: Packers, Coach Lombardi, Lombardi Trophy

[06:35] I'm from Wisconsin originally. I spent five years here in Miami. That's how I met a couple of you guys. And in Wisconsin, we love our Green Bay Packers. How many of you guys like football?

[06:48] I don't really watch it anymore because I don't have time, but I enjoy football. Usually the playoffs if the Packers are in it. Other than that, I don't really give a shit.

[07:00] But the Packers back in the day, you guys know that the Super Bowl trophy is named the Lombardi Trophy. That was our coach from back in the day. And the Packers were famous for running one play. It was called the Packer Sweep.

[07:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO

─────────────────────────────

TEXTO: "The Packer Sweep Philosophy"

NÚMEROS: One play, every day practice

VISUAL: Diagrama da jogada Packer Sweep

[07:20] And during practices, Coach Lombardi ran this play every single day. No other plays. It went to the left of the field or to the right. And it was the same shit play over and over and over again. And the point of doing that play is to get so good at that play. Even if the defense knows that you're running that play, you can still run it better than them and you can still get some yards and get into the end zone.

[07:45] So, I've been thinking a lot about that over the years and I was like thinking about my sales process. What helped me have success at my sales jobs? What helped me build some businesses?

TEXTO: "Sales Team Tracking Benefits"

NÚMEROS: None

VISUAL: Importância de processo unificado para tracking

[08:05] And ultimately what I'm going to do is give you guys the game and give you the playbook of what this actual process driven approach is. For those of you that have sales teams, this will be gold for you because your sales team, unless they're on a unified front doing the same things over and over again, you can't really track and measure why Tom did well and why Susan failed or vice versa.

[08:25] You can't really track anything unless you know your people are doing the same things over and over and over again. So, I'm going to give you guys exactly what works for me and what's worked for literally hundreds if not thousands of our clients.

TEXTO: "Scalable vs Non-Scalable Outreach"

NÚMEROS: None

VISUAL: Comparação entre métodos escaláveis e personalizados

[08:45] So, whether you guys get a lead in or not, I wanted to talk about this real quick. You have a scalable way of reaching out to a lead when they get into your funnel, your calendar, or whatever, and you have a non-scalable way.

[09:00] Obviously, the non-scalable way that I like to do this is I grab Jeremy's info, hopefully his cell phone number, I type it into my phone, and I literally shoot out a selfie video.

[09:12] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO

─────────────────────────────

TEXTO: "Selfie Video Script Example"

NÚMEROS: 4:00 Tuesday appointment

VISUAL: Exemplo de script para vídeo selfie personalizado

[09:15] "What's up, Jeremy? It's your boy Jordan over here up in Wisconsin. Wanted to put a face to the name, let you know I'm a real guy. Look forward to speaking with you at 4:00 on Tuesday. My job is simple. I just want to give you all the information that you need so that you can make a decision. If you have any questions, hit me back. This is my personal cell phone number."

[09:35] Obviously, that's not very scalable, especially if you're getting a ton of leads.

[09:42] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO

─────────────────────────────

TEXTO: "Scalable Video Solution"

NÚMEROS: 14,000 leads, 1,200 leads per month

VISUAL: Solução escalável: Vidyard + Zapier automation

[09:45] Scalable way of doing that would maybe be pre-recording something like that that's a little bit generic, uploading that to like Vidyard or something like that and using some type of automation software like Zapier to text message that video out to somebody's phone.

[10:00] I'm switching softwares for that case because 14,000 leads, 1200 leads a month, I can't very well do a personalized video for every single person when they come into our funnel.

TEXTO: "Four Benefits of Selfie Videos"

NÚMEROS: 50% conversion increase, 400% engagement increase

VISUAL: Lista dos 4 benefícios principais

[10:20] So, if you guys are getting involved in any of my stuff, you're probably not going to get a personalized selfie video right off the rip. With that being said, you're going to do four things if you do decide to take this approach.

[10:32] The first thing that you're going to do with a selfie video is you are going to make sure that you increase your ability to convert them by 50%. If you can get to them within the first five minutes, chances are pretty good that if you guys were all recently on the internet shopping for something, looking at something, an ad popped up, you put it in your browser, you probably forgot exactly what that thing is.

[10:55] You probably forgot the name of the product, the company, the website, or whatever it was because our attention, it goes everywhere, right? You guys know that you guys are marketers.

[11:05] So, at the end of the day, if you can get in contact with that lead within the first five minutes, statistically, you will increase your odds of converting that person by 50%.

TEXTO: "Differentiation from Competitors"

NÚMEROS: None

VISUAL: Vantagem competitiva através de humanização

[11:18] Also, you guys are going to be able to differentiate yourself from competitors. There's going to be people out there that don't send a shit video because they're too lazy, they think they had a bad hair day, they don't speak very well or whatever.

[11:32] So, if you are well spoken, you look halfway decent, shoot somebody a video real quick and humanize that experience that they're not going to get from any of your competitors.

TEXTO: "400% Engagement Increase"

NÚMEROS: 400% customer engagement increase

VISUAL: Aumento massivo no engajamento do cliente

[11:45] The third thing that you're going to do is increase your customer engagement by 400%. I'm saying like they're going to text you back or they're going to ask you a question or they're going to say, "lol, cool," or whatever. It doesn't really matter.

[12:00] All that I want to do is get in communication with people because if I can't get in communication with somebody, I can't do shit with them. Can't sell them. Can't book an appointment.

[12:10] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Unique Experience" NÚMEROS: None VISUAL: Experiência diferenciada que prospects não encontram em outros lugares

[12:12] And then the final thing is that you're giving people an experience that they're just unlikely to find anywhere else. And I've implemented this in pretty much every industry and the results are phenomenal.

[12:25] When you get a lead, if you can do something with some type of video, the results are absolutely insane. And this is something that I've been doing since 2014. When you could actually like send a video to somebody's phone. It's been one of the critical drivers of my success in sales is just getting this first little portion right.

[12:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Appointment Booking Strategy" NÚMEROS: None VISUAL: Estratégias para agendar compromissos

 

[12:50] If you don't automatically have somebody just, you know, go to your calendarly or your schedule once and book something for you and you have to get in contact with this person to book something, it is worth mentioning that you're going to have to book an appointment with them.

[13:05] You jump on the phone or you're texting with them or whatever. A couple of tips that I have for you is never be too available.

[13:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "High Social Status Positioning" NÚMEROS: None VISUAL: Posicionamento de alta autoridade social

[13:18] I want you guys to be like high social status. People that have money don't have... exactly. And if you have money, you're busy. You've got appointments. Everybody wants to see your product.

[13:30] So, what I usually do is I just tell people like, "Dude, I'm booked out for like the next week and a half. I got something like the 29th of this month at like 4:00. Does that work for you?"

[13:42] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Option Closes" NÚMEROS: 24th vs 26th example VISUAL: Técnica de fechamento com opções limitadas

[13:45] Sometimes I use option closes. "Does the 24th work for you or does the 26th?" And I like to narrow things down. If you ask people what time works best for you, Jeremy's going to be overwhelmed. He's going to be like, I don't know. Like, it's too many options that he's thinking about.

[14:00] But if you can narrow things down to one or two different things, you're going to increase your chances of somebody being able to say, "Sure, 3:00 on the 24th works best for me."

[14:12] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Reiterate Call Benefits" NÚMEROS: None VISUAL: Reforçar benefícios e highlights da chamada

[14:15] And also, of course, you're going to want to reiterate what type of highlights or things that they're going to be able to take away from your call. So, if I'm talking to any of you guys and I find out that the thing that you have attention on is following up with customers, I'm going to reiterate at the end of that scheduling the appointment phone call that you're going to walk away with at least three different techniques that you can use for free for the rest of your life to follow up with customers that are going to be highly converting.

[14:40] And I'm going to leave a little hook right there because I want you to understand that this appointment that you have with me is important and that you should show up. And here's why.

[14:50] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Post-Scheduling Confirmation Video" NÚMEROS: 4:00 on the 24th VISUAL: Segundo vídeo selfie após agendamento

[14:55] Finally, after I schedule an appointment with somebody, again, if this is if I'm manually a part of that process, that's where they're also getting another selfie video. "Hey Tom, Jordan over here, obviously I got you locked in on my calendar at 4:00 on the 24th. I genuinely look forward to it."

[15:12] "Again, wanted to remind you that if you need to reschedule, have any questions, or need anything from me between now and then, feel free to reach out. This is my personal cell phone number."

[15:25] Again, you're doing everything that I just mentioned by increasing conversion rate and also increasing your customer engagement.

[15:32] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "The Sales Algorithm" NÚMEROS: None VISUAL: Algoritmo de vendas - processo controlável

[15:35] But sooner or later, and I wanted to get to this part pretty quickly because I know that this is the one thing that we all do is we pitch the deal. So, sooner or later, 4:00 on the 24th pops up, it's time for me to get on a Zoom call with Tom and show him something or at least have a conversation.

[15:52] And so, what I want to do is I want to give you guys my sales algorithm. I've been doing the sales training thing for a long time and a client in Tennessee, he's a marketing company. They do all the Airbnbs and VRBOs in the Smoky Mountains. Pretty dope little business.

[16:10] And I was talking to him and his team about the pitch. And he's like, "Dude, doesn't really matter what the customer says. Like, you're always in control. Nowhere to go." And it's like an algorithm. If they say this, you say that, and it just doesn't fucking matter.

 

[16:25] So that's what I want to give you guys is as close to the detail as possible of how you guys can just have a controllable process that you can duplicate over and over and over again like the Green Bay Packers back in the day and win a lot of Super Bowls.

[16:40] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "High Social Status Opening" NÚMEROS: None VISUAL: Abertura com alta autoridade vs baixa autoridade

[16:45] So you start off your pitch, the first thing that you're going to want to do is be high social status. If you're on the phone with Kim Kardashian and she's trying to talk to you about some makeup, are you going to pay attention? Probably. One, cuz she got an assload of followers. Two, she's rich as hell, and three, she knows what she's talking about when it comes to makeup.

[17:05] A lot of us, and I spent a lot of my career doing this, jump on and we prize our customer. It's like, man, if I could just get a deal with Jeremy, I'm going to kiss his ass when he jumps on the call.

[17:18] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Low Status Example (DON'T DO THIS)" NÚMEROS: None VISUAL: Exemplo de posicionamento baixo que afasta prospects ricos

[17:20] "Hey, man, thank you so much for taking time out of your day. I know you're super busy, and I'm just really excited that you're going to like take a look at this." That's a low social status thing. People with money, people with affluence, people with wealth. They don't want to talk to people that are on a lower level than them. They'd like to reach up or at least be on the same level.

[17:40] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "High Status Opening Script" NÚMEROS: None VISUAL: Script de abertura com alta autoridade 

[17:45] So, the thing that I always do first thing is I say, "Hey, Tom, I'm really happy we were both able to take some time out of our day to take a look at this. I know the one thing that we both have in common is that neither of us have enough time to discuss probably every single thing that it is that we do."

[18:00] "So, to make best use of your time and my time, I want to give you the price of our product upfront so you can justify it as we go. Fair enough."

[18:10] I'm getting straight to the point. I'm putting myself on their level. I'm letting them know I don't have a whole lot of time and I'm going to give people the price of my product upfront.

[18:20] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Price Range Strategy" NÚMEROS: $10K-$50K monthly range VISUAL: Estratégia de dar faixa de preço para produtos variáveis

[18:25] For those of you that have a ballpark or a range, like it could vary from $10,000 a month to $50,000, give them a range. "Hey, I want to let you know completely dependent upon what you value and what you see inside here, you could expect to invest $10,000 a month up to $50,000 a month."

[18:42] "Not saying that you will, not saying that you should, but if you were going to make a $50,000 per month investment today, what would be the one, two, maybe three things you would absolutely need to see here today in order to justify an investment like that?"

[18:58] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "The Golden Question" NÚMEROS: None VISUAL: Pergunta chave que entrega o controle ao prospect

[19:00] That right there is gold. It's absolute straight fucking fire if you guys caught it. I've been using this on every single sales pitch for years. And what this does is it gets to the point. It increases my social status. It puts me on a short time limit. And I'm getting to price quickly.

[19:18] And instead of me actually guessing now for the next 20, 30, 40 minutes what somebody might need to see or hear in order to be impressed with my product enough to buy it, I'm asking them with a back door out.

[19:30] "Hey, I'm not going to say that you should do this or that you will, but if you were going to blow 100K with me today on your AMX and get a bunch of points, what would be the one, two, maybe three things you would absolutely need to see here today in order to justify a decision like that?"

[19:45] Now, I put the ball in their court and they get to tell me the one, the two, the three, the most important things that they're hoping to find out on this call. Again, I haven't given them any information. I haven't given them shit. I've given them a price and I've asked them if you were going to do something with that, what would you need to see?

[20:05] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Benefits of Price First" NÚMEROS: None VISUAL: Vantagens: controle, status alto, elimina prospects ruins

[20:08] And that is your intro. It goes super fast, keeps you in control, high social status, and gets to the point. By the way, introducing pricing details up front. You're going to shuffle the jokers out of the deck.

[20:20] Occasionally, there's going to be people that can't afford your shit. Why talk to them? I don't want to waste 40 minutes talking to somebody that ultimately is going to be like, "Dude, really? I'm not authorized to make that transaction. I don't have that type of money."

[20:35] "I want them off the call like in the first minute. I don't want to talk to people that don't have money because that's just a waste of my time. I'm not going to educate people that can't afford what it is that I do."

[20:48] So, that's the additional side of that. And also again, you've gotten pricing out of the way. A lot of people tend to wait to drop price at the end, but really at the end of the day, when you have that pricing at the end, that's the main reason why people can cop out of receiving all the value that you just spent 30 minutes showing them.

 [21:05] So, now that you've gotten it out of the way, now you can move on into the rest of your pitch.

[21:12] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Shut The Hell Up - Talk Time Statistics" NÚMEROS: Top closers: <40% talking, Average: 58%, Worst: talk too much VISUAL: Estatísticas de tempo de fala por performance de vendedor

[21:15] One thing that you're also going to want to do is shut the hell up. Statistics and reports show that top closers, the top 1%ers, the people that close deals, are going to spend less than 40% of the entire sales interaction doing the talking.

[21:30] Statistics show that average closers, people that are probably, you know, barely meeting or kind of around quota or whatever it is that they're trying to accomplish, are going to spend about 58% of that conversation doing the talking.

[21:42] Worst sales reps, the ones that you fire, the ones that are at the bottom 1%, well, they talk a fucking ton. They just jibber jabber over and over in what I call like word vomit about how excited they are about their product and about what it does and how it's going to be beneficial and they never ask questions.

[22:00] And ultimately, those are amateur salespeople. So, be mindful of how much time you spend speaking.

[22:08] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Question Techniques" NÚMEROS: 30-40 seconds talking limit VISUAL: Técnicas para controlar tempo de fala com perguntas

[22:12] And one tip that I used back in the day when I was really wordy is I just grabbed my iPhone, went to the little timer thing and I would just watch a stopwatch and I would just wait till it hit 30 to 40 seconds and then what I wrote down was a massive list of questions that I could just pop in at any time just to do a little ping-pong with my buyer.

[22:30] And then finally I got it kind of set up now where it's like I know I've been talking too much. "What do you like about that?" Simple question. "Does that make sense?" And I can just at least get my conversation finished and allow them an opportunity to do some speaking.

[22:45] But again, a lot of what I practice is question-based selling and it's just a long list of questions essentially that sound conversational which I can talk about in a little bit. 

[22:55] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Emotion vs Logic Framework" NÚMEROS: None VISUAL: Pessoas compram por emoção, fecham por lógica

[23:00] I'm sure that you guys have heard I need to frame the rest of this the tactical parts of this sales pitch. I need to frame it. And so you guys have probably heard that people buy off of emotion and they close on logic. Does it make sense? Can I afford this? Is this in the budget? Is this responsible? Do I need this?

[23:18] So, let's talk about emotions because I don't think that I know any sales trainers, books, people that ever really talk about this and unpack it. So, I'm going to give you guys a pretty good idea here of why people buy your shit.

[23:32] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Think About Your Buyers' Emotions" NÚMEROS: None VISUAL: Exercício para identificar emoções que geram compras

[23:35] I want you guys to think for a quick second, though. What specific emotions come to mind that you believe your buyers feel that cause them to say, "Here's my credit card number. Send me the contract. I'm ready to do some business with you." Think about that real quick.

[23:50] You can write a couple of ideas down. I'm going to give you guys some game here in a second, but think about what somebody feels when they're purchasing something.

I rented a Porsche 911 because, well, there's a lot of emotions that are going to be tied into why I decided to spend money on a car when I could have just Ubered. There's a Porsche 911 out there. One thing that I wanted to do when I pulled into Jeremy's inner circle when I see Uruses and all these nice cars out here is I wanted to feel confident about parking my car out front and being that type of person to walk in the front door with the silhouette of a sports car behind me. I wanted to feel confident.

[24:55] Does your product or service give your buyer an emotion or feeling of confidence? I've built a multi-million dollar business on ultimately sales training is sales training. But what am I really giving people? I'm giving them what to do next. And when people know what to do next, what to say next, they have confidence.

[25:15] And ultimately, when I'm asking my students, my clients, you know, how do you feel about the training? I want them to drop that C word, confidence, because then I know that I've done my job and they're going to get the results that they need because they know what to do next.

[26:32] I know some people that don't do business with my company because they want more sales. It's a growing business and maybe the owner, the director of sales is getting too busy to actually give their team attention and the training that they need. And so the main thing that they're just looking to do is get some of that sales training off their plate.

[26:50] And I have to make sure obviously in our onboarding process that I understand that or else I'm going to be watching the wrong metrics. So be thoughtful and be thinking on does my product or service is it being marketed is the reason why people purchase it based on the fact that you're really solving a pain point for them versus trying to give them an advantage because a lot of people will do things to avoid pain and I know that you guys would agree with that.

[27:38] I feel more competent like I'm a better driver because I got better tires on that car. That's why they're worth more money. That's why I would want to purchase those. Does your product and service help people do things that they otherwise can't do or get results that they otherwise can't get?

This is why you might forego being savvy at Pay Less and you might end up going and you know buy some Yeezys for your kid for school so that they can feel accepted if all the other kids at school wear Yeezys.

[29:08] The main reason I bought an iPhone years and years ago, I had an Android at one point. That was a low point in my life is because all my friends had one. They're all like, "Dude, blue messages." I'm like, "What? I want to be a part of that." So, I went and bought an iPhone.

[29:25] So, the point is that acceptance is also a really big thing as well. So, think about what you really sell.

You got an engine, you got blind spot monitoring, you've got PDK, dual clutch transmission, you got dual exhaust. Those are all features.

[32:25] People don't buy shit because of features. They don't because they don't get anybody emotional. They don't get anybody to actually feel anything. It's like, I know that there's a 400 horsepower engine in that car. Whoop-de-doo.

I've got a 400 horsepower engine that allows me to go fast, which means that dude, if I line up with another car at a red light, I can take off and I can beat him off the line, feel like a big shot, feeling confident.

[33:28] Or maybe I'm feeling relief. "Man, all my friends have sports cars. I'm feeling relief and acceptance because every time I'm at my friend's house and we're peeling out of the driveway, dude, I'm the last one in line cuz my car is slow. I'm going to go buy a faster car."

You just put in your people's first, last name, and email address, send it over to us, and schedule your sales kickoff, your manager's onboarding, and all of our recurring training calls."

[47:12] You don't want any uncertainty there. And be mindful of the fact that you guys sell what you sell every single day. You know your product, your service, your contracts inside and outside. So it might be like completely like we don't have to explain this to anybody, but your buyer doesn't know what they don't know and they're not going to ask what they don't know how to ask.

[47:32] So be mindful of the fact that you can make a slide like this or whatever just to show them what those next steps look like. And once you implement that, I believe that your closing ratios by default, if you take nothing else away from this, are going to improve because people are going to understand what next steps are.

[57:00] They are now on track to do $110 million this year and it's only what October and they're doing more gross. They're doing a 72% more net profit than they were previously in January.
