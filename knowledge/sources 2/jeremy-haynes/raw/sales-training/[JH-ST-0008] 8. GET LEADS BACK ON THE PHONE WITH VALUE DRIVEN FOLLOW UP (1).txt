[00:02] We're going to talk about a concept called value-driven follow-up. Value-driven follow-up is the greatest way to follow up. Like I said, I run a marketing agency and in my business over the last seven and a half years, we've only done outbound sales to cold leads who have no idea who we are.

[00:40] It's very simple. Rather than doing the annoying that most sales people do, which is, let me give you an example. I made my initial pitch or I established my initial communication. The annoying way to do it would be following up.

 

[00:55] "Hey, just seeing if you got my last message. Hey, did you watch that video I sent? Hey, just wondering if you saw my last message. Hey, do you have time to talk later today?" That's annoying and provides no value for the person. It's selfish.

[01:40] Let me give you some examples for what we use inside of my marketing agency for how we follow up with people and do it in a valuable way. We'll go find a new article from Facebook. Facebook has this entire platform called the Facebook newsroom. So does Instagram. So does Google Adwords. So does YouTube.

**TEXTO:** "Low Pressure Sales Tactics"

**NÚMEROS:** Once per week ideal frequency

**VISUAL:** Estabelecimento gradual de expertise e presença mental

 

[02:50] What we're going to do with value-driven follow-up, the intention of it is to communication by communication establish ourselves with a level of expertise. We call this low pressure sales tactics.

 

[03:05] By simply staying in the mental view of a person by simply showing up in a person's life, they know who we are. They know what we're there to talk about. They know what we sell. We don't need to directly tell them every time like they're a kindergartner who doesn't understand.

 

[03:25] We just need to be there so they think of us at least once a week. That's the ideal scenario with value driven follow-up.

[03:55] "We just came out with another one and it goes through a little bit about our investing process and some of the customers who have just recently put up some money with us and what their returns were. I want to send it over to you so you can get an idea of how well we treat our customers. Let me know what you think."

[05:35] I want to make sure that I'm ready to send selfie videos on the fly when necessary. In addition to that, I want to make sure that I have those sales aid videos that we talked about a few videos ago.

**NÚMEROS:** Q4, 10% price increase

**VISUAL:** Exemplo de mensagem usando escassez real

 

[05:55] That's the point of value-driven follow-up. And that is a huge way that we get leads back into the communication cycle with the business. In addition to that, we can always use scarcity.

 

[06:10] We can say things like, "Hey, what's going on? Q4 is coming up and our costs are going up by about 10% in anticipation for all the activity that's going to happen throughout these next three months. I just wanted to give you a courtesy to let you know that you should do this deal with us sooner than later."

 

[06:30] "That way you get a little bit of a discount. If you're not worried about the price, then disregard." Most people will respond quite well to that type of message.

[06:50] So value-driven follow-up can help get more people on the phone. In addition to that, real scarcity can help get people onto the phone. Incentives can also help get people onto the phone.

 

[07:05] We can use things like, "Hey, I'd love to get you on the phone with a past buyer of ours. Let me know if you're interested. I'd love for you to establish contact with somebody who's already gone through our buying process so you can see how great we are as an organization."

 

[07:25] The incentive would be, I want to make sure that the potential client I'm going to connect them with, who's already worked with us. I want to make sure that if that person ends up closing, that that potential client who took their time to talk to that potential buyer gets paid a little bit commission.
