Transcrição Completa: 16 How To Keep Your Standards High

 

[00:00] In life and in business, your standards are going to materialize in everything around you. Let's say you wake up every morning, you don't make your bed.

 

[00:08] Let's say you also take off your clothes the night before, you just leave them on the floor. After a few days, you just got a big pile in the corner or something.

 

[00:16] Let's say in your kitchen, you know, you kind of leave trash here and there, and then after a few days, you got a you got a pile in your kitchen filled with trash and dishes.

 

[00:26] Let's say, you know, that then causes you to not eat healthier because then you're forced to order more food. And more food usually means that it's lower quality comparatively to the health standard that you could be operating at if you simply had a cleaner kitchen.

 

[00:42] But that effect from going from not making the bed to leaving things around just from the night before, you all of a sudden everything around you is going to start getting the same way.

 

[00:52] How you do one thing is how you do everything. So all of a sudden the area where you're chilling, you know, your little living room, that starts to get a little messier.

 

[01:00] You know, same thing occurs. You start to leave a little more trash here and there. Things aren't necessarily as symmetrical as they used to be. You're not folding your throw blankets or you're not, you know, making your pillows nice.

 

[01:12] Let's say every day I woke up, I just said, "Fuck it. I'm not going to shave today." You know, I'm not I'm not going to put uh a nice clean shave down here. I'm not going to clean this up.

 

[01:22] I'm just gonna, you know, whatever. I'm just gonna let it grow. I'm going to let it look like a bunch of random pubes on my face, thick neck hair, and just overall lower my standard.

 

[01:31] Let's say I don't get my haircut every week or every two weeks or so. Let's say I just choose to decision after decision after decision.

 

[01:39] All of a sudden, those choices add up to a lot of life around you that's really just a resemblance of your own standards reflecting back at you.

 

[01:48] But it becomes your entire life when you compound those low standard decisions. So as an example, one day when you wake up, you don't make your bed, but everything else around your home, you've kept that high standard.

 

[02:01] It's much easier to maintain the higher standard. Meaning as soon as you walk out to the rest of the home and it's very nice, everything's clean, everything's stable, and and once again, everything is reflecting a higher standard.

 

[02:14] You're much more likely and inclined to keep everything else that's a part of the next set of decisions. You got to make it a higher standard.

 

[02:22] It starts with one decision and then that standard for whatever level of standard you chose to make that decision with then carries into the next decision and the next and the next.

 

[02:33] Then after a week or so you either got a shitty life or you got a life that reflects a higher standard.

 

[02:39] Same exact thing goes for your business. If you choose to not do things like IQ test, EQ test, personality test the people that you're going to work with.

 

[02:49] If you choose not to put an agreement in between you and every client so you're legally protected.

 

[02:54] If you choose to disrespect the perfect client traits and your do not client traits. Well, guess what? It's the same thing.

 

[03:02] Decision after decision after decision. Whatever level of standard that you've made the decision with is all of a sudden going to be your business.

 

[03:10] This can start right away for you. Literally right after this video, you can choose to decision after decision after decision raise your standard and use it as an opportunity for you to materialize a life around you that reflects the standards that you internally think you're operating at.

 

[03:27] You'll find that if you internally have a high standard and your external life is a low standard, you're going to have unhappiness.

 

[03:35] You're not going to be as fulfilled. Your environment, the people, the places, it's all going to be a distraction and take energy away from you.

 

[03:43] And you might be confused when in reality you control it. You control it with the decisions you make one after the other after the other after the other.

 

[03:52] As insignificant as each decision is in itself, the accumulative amount of decisions that you make in a day, over a week, over a month become your life.

 

[04:02] They become your business. So if you want to change your life, you want to change your business, change the standard of decisions that you make.

 

[04:10] I'll see you in the next video.
