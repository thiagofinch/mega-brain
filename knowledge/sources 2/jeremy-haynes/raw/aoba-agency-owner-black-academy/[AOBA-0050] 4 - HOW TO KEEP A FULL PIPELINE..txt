Transcrição Completa: How To Keep A Full Pipeline

 

[00:00] When you need money, it's already too late. You should have had a pipeline built up of people that you can call on ready to close, ready to bank deals with in order to get yourself financially where you need to be at to fund whatever it is that you might be worried about at any given time.

 

[00:18] Meaning, if you know that you have bills in 30 days, the worst thing that you could do is wait 21 days and then start taking a substantial amount of action to try to make the money you now need in seven days from that date.

 

[00:32] If you start taking actions well before you actually need the results from those actions, you have a much higher probability of staying in a healthy comfortable scale that keeps you in control rather than being reactive, falling victim to circumstances that you created by not taking enough action in the right amount of time.

 

[00:50] Everything that you're doing in business is a very calculated approach. Everything is a number and everything can be quantified.

 

[00:58] So to be clear when I say that if you have a bill that you know you need paid in two weeks or in 45 days or in three days, you want to understand that the amount of stress you're going to have, the amount of action that you're likely going to take, and the overall state that you take it in will be completely controlled based upon your internal belief that you can derive the result from whatever action you can put into getting that result.

 

[01:25] If you don't have enough time or if you don't make enough time for yourself or leave yourself with enough time that is to take the right amount of actions to have a probability of getting what you need accomplished and materialized well you understood you could have done it before then and you might be in the situation you're in now where you're going to have to take an additional amount of action and have an unbalanced day where you'll likely sleep less.

 

[01:51] You'll participate in less activities because you have to focus in one particular area that you've been ignoring for the duration before that.

 

[01:59] Don't learn this key lesson again and again and again and again. Simply recognize. You can quantify when you need what. Meaning you can break it down to recognize with a number.

 

[02:10] Okay, I got to pay this in this amount of time. I got to pay this in this amount of time. This is how much money I need to make then and this is how much money I need to live in prosperity and make freedom of choice and freedom of time for myself and my team.

 

[02:24] What is it that you really want to do and what you want to accomplish? Write down your goals and be very factually uh precise with what you can and can't do for yourself given your current time that you've left yourself to materialize them.

 

[02:38] Start with the things that you need to pay and then go to the things that you want to pay and make sure you do the math.

 

[02:44] Okay, this is a very simple video for you to understand because like I said at the beginning of this, when you need money, it's already too late. Keep your pipeline full. I'll see you in the next video.
