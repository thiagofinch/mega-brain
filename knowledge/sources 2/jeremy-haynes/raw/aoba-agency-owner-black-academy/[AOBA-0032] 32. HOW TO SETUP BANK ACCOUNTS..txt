Transcrição Completa: 32 How To Setup Bank Accounts

 

[00:00][music]

 

[00:02]"You need to go to the bank and you need to set up multiple bank accounts. And I mean that."

 

[00:08]"One of the biggest reasons that I did not take that action when I first got started is I didn't feel I had enough money to open up multiple bank accounts."

 

[00:17]"So, I didn't even start the process of automating money coming from one account and going into all these other accounts."

 

[00:24]"I felt like I was so scarce that I couldn't go to the bank. I felt like my ego couldn't handle going to the bank, looking another human in the eyes, and saying, 'Hey, you know, I only have 500 bucks, but I need to open six different bank accounts right now.'"

 

[00:40]"I didn't understand that it was a requirement, and that it would start the cycle no matter how much money I had, and that it would benefit me right away upon making the decision."

 

[00:51]"I instead let my ego and my lower self dictate not taking that action for a longer period of time."

 

[00:58]"So, I want to be direct with you here. Go to the bank. Set up multiple bank accounts."

 

[01:03]"Take what I just said very seriously in these previous videos with an operating account, a tax account, an emergency fund account, wiring money over to your personal account, potentially not even having debit cards for some of these so you never touch them."

 

[01:20]"Don't be afraid to go to multiple banks and create automatic wires that occur between your accounts that you have so one account is completely isolated so you never touch it."

 

[01:30]"If you have that kind of problem, to be very direct, don't let your lower self and let your ego hold you back from benefiting your future self."

 

[01:39]"Go take the action as a little bit of homework between this video and your next video."

 

[01:44]"Even if it's a hundred bucks, split it to 20 20 20 and open up five different accounts."

 

[01:50]"Just of course oblige by whatever the bank's minimums are and you'll be fine."

 

[01:55]"I'll see you in the next video."
