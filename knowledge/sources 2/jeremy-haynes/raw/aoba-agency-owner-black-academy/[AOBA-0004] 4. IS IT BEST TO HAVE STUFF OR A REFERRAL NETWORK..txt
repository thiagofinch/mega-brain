Transcrição Completa: Is It Best To Have Staff Or A Referral Network

 

[00:00] So, when you first get started, do you want staff, contractors, a strategic referral network? What's going to be the best for when you're first getting started?

 

[00:09] And as you choose to scale up in your agency, one of the biggest things that holds people back is taking on staff.

 

[00:16] Staff does not equal success. To be very clear, that was the wrong data I had operated on when I first got started.

 

[00:24] I had thought, you know, every deal I take on, it's probably healthy for me to bring on an additional person here. Or, you know, every four deals that I take on, let's bring on another staff member for this position so we help my operational load.

 

[00:38] At one point, I even hired a COO. It's like this 50-year-old plus woman who helped my business out in a very moderate light way.

 

[00:46] And it was a it was a very inefficient, ineffective payroll and expense on my end from having staff instead of contractors and strategic referral network partners.

 

[00:57] This is a fine balance and a key set of lessons that I want to make sure I pass on to you. Not something to limit you, not something that's a projected bias or a particular value that I hold.

 

[01:08] As I've continued to scale, I've continued to increase the quality of mentors that I learn from and the amount of money I spend to learn from those mentors.

 

[01:17] And most successful people that I've met that are in the hundreds of plus millions of dollars per year range continue to tell me, "You don't have to hire staff anymore, especially in our current economic system."

VISUAL: Comparação visual entre três modelos de negócio: Staff (funcionários fixos), Contractors (freelancers por projeto), e Strategic Referral Network (rede de parcerias estratégicas). Layout provavelmente mostra prós e contras de cada modelo.

 

[01:32] You need to be hiring contractors more than anybody else. Pay per project. People who are paid for results, people who are paid when they do specific revenue-driven tasks that you can quantify, meaning you can do the math and see the numbers on.

 

[01:48] You do not want to take on the expense, the liability, especially when you're first getting started, the burden of payroll.

 

[01:56] If you bring on an assistant in a W2 position, which here in the United States means that they're an employee from our tax code perspective, or wherever you are around the world, that applies to you.

 

[02:08] What you're really doing is you're taking on the person's monthly bills. You're paying the rent. You're buying the food. You know, you're putting money in their savings for whatever amount it is that you say you're going to pay this person that they end up doing whatever they do with, right?

[02:26] You will provide a life and a lifestyle for the people that you choose to take on in your payroll.

 

[02:32] You also take on the liabilities. There's tax liability. There's employment liabilities. There's employment taxes, right? It's all kinds of stuff.

 

[02:41] You might even have to, depending on the area you're in or the state you're in or the country in, provide health benefits and additional expenditure just from taking on somebody as a staff member instead of a contractor.

 

[02:54] Contractors are very critical for your success, especially lowering your expenses to a moderate level that you can handle.

 

[03:02] That way, you can be putting money towards what really matters, which is growth, marketing, savings, and unfortunately, your taxes.

[03:13] So, staff, contractors, or strategic referral networks. What it really comes down to for me, contractors and a strategic referral network. Those are the two best options, the best plays that you can use.

 

[03:27] There's all kinds of video courses inside of this specific program that come with, for example, how to use upwork.com, an incredible publicly traded company, by the way, that is just a massive market of freelancers and every different digital skill that you can imagine, online and offline skills.

[03:49] Never pay hourly, ever. You always want to be paying on a pay per project level.

 

[03:56] Not a salary where somebody's making a certain amount per week just to sit around and do whatever amount of work that they end up doing, but pay per project. Okay?

 

[04:06] That's going to save you a lot of money, save you a lot of time, incentivize the other person to do things faster and a higher quality.

 

[04:14] Don't be afraid to provide revenue driven rewards though. Hey, if we do it in this amount of time instead of this amount of time, I'll give you this much money instead of this much money.

[04:26] That's still much more effective than all the liabilities and the additional cost expenditures that you're going to take on when bringing on a staff member comparatively.

 

[04:37] Now, what's the difference between a contractor and a strategic referral network partner?

 

[04:42] Well, that person who's already an expert, who already has skills, who might even have a team of people behind them, right?

 

[04:49] You don't need that person to work for you as a contractor. You don't need that person as a staff member, of course.

 

[04:55] You just need to make a deal with that person where you say, "Hey, this client is whatever they're going to pay you. I need a kickback from that. Okay, I need 10%. I need 20%. Right? I need this amount per month paid to me from me bringing you that business."

[05:15] You can work it out however you want. Best practices get paid on a recurring basis.

 

[05:20] If you bring somebody a deal, guess what? You can get paid monthly for that deal that you brought that other person if that other person is selling monthly services.

 

[05:29] There's also all kinds of transactional services that you want to avoid selling because you want recurring revenue and not transactional that you can refer to other people who like running transactional businesses that you can still get paid on on that one-time basis.

 

[05:45] If you're getting paid one time, get paid more. If you're getting paid recurring, be willing to take a little less, make it fair, whatever it is that you end up working out.

[05:57] Strategic referral network is one of the biggest and best places to do that.

 

[06:02] Be sure to qualify these people. Ask them, "What type of results have you gotten for other people? How many clients have you taken on? What are you at right now monthly? What are your next goals for how much you want to make and how can I help you do that?"

 

[06:18] Get a real relationship with the people that you're going to be referring deals to.

 

[06:23] Do not just have one conversation with them and say, "You can do YouTube ads." Every YouTube ad that comes to me and says, "Hey, I want a deal where I can do YouTube ads. I'm going to give to you and you pay me 10%." And that's the only conversation you have.

[06:40] You want to have a detailed, thorough conversation. And if they're your friend, still put a contract in place and make sure that you say if this deal comes to you or if any deal comes to you, pay me this much back on it.

 

[06:53] That way you have everything in writing in case anything gets messy. Right?

 

[06:57] End all here, the long story short, the summary if you will. No staff.

 

[07:03] You want contractors. You can have contractors physically on site with you and they can still be listed legally in your tax code wherever you're at.

 

[07:12] Once again, make sure you consult with a tax consultant and your lawyer, whoever you need to. That way, this is contextual.

 

[07:19] You can still have contractors in house and avoid the expense and the liability of what they would be if they were a staff member. You can still do that.

[07:30] You do not need to have fear or anxiety around this topic. To be very clear, you should be focused on building a team of excellent contractors because contractors, they're going to be the ones that you pay and then you get to take however much you take off the top of that.

 

[07:46] So, as an example, let's say you got a graphics guy, an advertiser, a video guy behind the scenes.

 

[07:53] You could be selling, for example, the services that they have. Let's say they only want $1,000 a month to do XYZ.

 

[08:00] You could go sell that for $5,000. And then your agency profits $4,000 from having a contractor that you can refer business to or that's in your team.

 

[08:11] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Contractor Profit Margin Example"

[08:13] Boom. That just needs $1,000 bucks to make you $4,000.

 

[08:17] Any deal, any contractor, any service that you're selling, it's very applicable. Same concept in the strategic referral network.

 

[08:24] Of course, you're going to get less in that example comparatively to more.

 

[08:29] So once again, to be clear, the mathematical benefit to contractors over staff and the strategic referral network, you're likely going to get more per deal that you bring in for a contractor.

 

[08:41] You're going to have to pay less for contractors. So you'll have more margin on deals that you close and that you're responsible for as an agency.

 

[08:50] The benefits of the strategic referral network, you take off the liability of being responsible for the delivery and the result.

 

[08:58] You're literally referring somebody over to another qualified business. So therefore, you're just getting a kickback when that person closes with their business.

 

[09:07] You're not necessarily responsible for the result. Of course, your reputation's on the line when you refer people business.

[09:16] So, as I said, make sure you qualify people that you're referring deals to. Get the best results for the people that you're referring and make sure you get a kickback.

 

[09:26] Recurring, take a little less. Transactional, take a little more.

 

[09:31] Contractors, understand that you're going to once again be charging whatever you charge and that you're spending whatever you need to spend for them to do that job, but you're managing them in that example, right?

 

[09:42] Contractors are not necessarily entrepreneurial comparatively to skill-based and passion driven about their hobby which they've made into something that they're selling.

 

[09:53] Digital skills usually are hobbies for contractors. Things they have fun doing, things they like doing, things that they don't necessarily want to go out and have the burden of selling and the burden of being a business.

 

[10:05] They'd rather be a contractor, which is great.

[10:09] And staff, as I said, avoid staff. That's liability. That's expense. That's additional taxes.

 

[10:17] And to be very clear, it's you taking on the responsibility of everything that financially relates to the people that you bring on as a staff member, including benefits, just the overall quality of life once again.

 

[10:30] So reduce the liability, reduce the expenses, go with contractor, strategic referral network.
