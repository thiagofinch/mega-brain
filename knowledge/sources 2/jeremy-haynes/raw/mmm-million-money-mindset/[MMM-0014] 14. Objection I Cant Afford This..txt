TEXTO: "Three Types of Affordability Issues"
NÚMEROS: Não especificados numericamente
VISUAL: Três cenários: sem capital na conta, tem dinheiro mas não quer pagar à vista, não sabia das opções de financiamento
[01:19] Because if somebody says, "I can't afford this." It's either once again, they don't have the capital in their account currently to be able to pay for it, or they might have enough cash, but they can't justify making the lumpsum payment to you and then have enough left over to do everything else they want to do, or they just didn't know you have funding options.
[01:37] I would encourage going through the funding options. If they still say, "No, I'm not really interested in doing the funding options."
[01:44] um you know what else do you think I could do? Maybe you have some internal payment plans that you could go over with the person.

[01:53] So in my business as an example for our information product education company, we have a 5K product.
[01:59] Uh we give the most incentive to people who pay it in full in cash.
[02:04] Uh the people who provide funding options and get approved for it, we'll give them the same incentives for the people that get approved for the 5K because we still get paid 5K if they go through the funding option.
[02:16] they're going to pay a little more in interest, but they're going to have a much smaller payment for a longer period of time.
[02:22] And they're once again making those payments to the funding company, not to us.
[02:27] And then if the person does not get approved for funding, and if once again, they don't have 5K in cash, then we have our own internal payment plans like a $2,600 split pay where they'll pay it over two months instead with 2,600 a month.
