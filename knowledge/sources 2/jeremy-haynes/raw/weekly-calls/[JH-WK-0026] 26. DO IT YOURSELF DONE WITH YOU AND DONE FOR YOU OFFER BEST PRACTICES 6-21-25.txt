26. Do It Yourself Done With You And Done For You Offer Best Practices 6-21-25.mp4 All right, well, welcome into this week's weekly group call. Got a banger for you guys here today. So Pascal was... asking some specific questions that I felt like we could cover. Directly and we could also cover inside of a more expanded topic at the same time. Most recently, there's been several of you guys that have been asking things about how your own inner circle programs can function and it's been some of you guys just asking about things related to drop cells. And, you know, there's... a whole slew of best practices when it comes to offers in general. And I believe that there's three different categories of offers. I believe that these offers are done on your own, done with you, and done for you. And I believe that between those three iterations, there are some best practices that correlate to those. So in this specific call, I'm going to go through a handful of things. I'm going to go through. pricing structures, how not to cannibalize a higher ticket sale with a lower ticket sale. We're going to be going through just the best practices in general of like the offer stacks here for these three different levels. And we're going to make sure that you guys walk away with a lot of value, of course, to be able to make more money. So without further ado. Let's get started, huh? All right, let me share my screen here. So first things first, like I said, we got to think in categories when we do this. All right. So when you, when you quote unquote, think in categories for offers, like I said, I think that there's three things. There's do-it-yourself. There's the done with you. And then there's the done for you, okay? And these three different levels, the very first thing to understand is just pricing. Obviously, the do-it-yourself is typically the cheap. The done with you is typically a mid-tier and the done for you should be rather costly. I'm actually going to put $4 signs because they generally differentiate like that. To be clear. There's also far less involvement from you and your organization as you descend down this ladder, okay? As you climb up the ladder to the 'done' for you, obviously, there's much more involvement, so that justifies a much higher price. So, as an example, some of you right now will have like one of these, or maybe at most two of these, but you don't actually have all three. And I think that you miss a tremendous amount of revenue as a result of not having all three of these different categories. So to be clear. When it comes to fulfillment, it's... The least. Man, if I could spell. The Least. involved. a . k . a. the most efficient. most efficient. We have somewhat involved. And then we have. Rather efficient. Not super efficient, but you know, hey. Rather efficient. And then, of course, we have the most involved. And this is... can still be efficient? depending on how it's executed. but most work. Okay, I'm going to give you some examples from mine so you guys can think with this easily. So for me, our do-it-yourself is what we call master internet marketing. This is a 5K price point. It's a one-time 5K cost. The cheapest thing that we got for people, $5 ,000. And this is just a course and a community. This is our version of a 'do it on your own.' In addition to that, we have AI Jeremy, which is a huge leverage play. One thing that we'll talk about that's really important that you have to understand is what makes something highly effective and efficient is leverage. We've talked about this on previous weekly group calls. I'll reiterate it again now. AI Jeremy is a perfect example of a highly leveraged action. Okay, I've talked and shown some of the statistics. For what AI Jeremy has done for us. Let me log into this real quick so I can. See if I can actually show it to you guys so you guys can see some of the statistics for what it's done. Because it's pretty fucking crazy. So. Look at this. Let me see if I can get to the back end here real quick. One second. The main thing I want to show you guys is the statistics for like how crazy it's been. Yeah, here we go. Let me share my screen on this other one real quick. One second. Bang, bang, bang. Okay, so check this out. So this is just the last seven days worth of data. Okay, again, just seven days. That's it. And I want you to look specifically at this, okay? It's been 101 hours of time. And 3,033 messages answered. Just in the last seven days. It's been 428 total conversations that people have had with it. Over the last, let's just look at the last 30 days. Over the last 30 days, 415 hours. 12,469 messages, 1,800. and 18 total conversations. If you just look at the lifetime, It's been 5,859 total conversations. 49,000 individual messages answered. And on top of that, look at all these other insights. Okay. So as an example, from the lifetime of creation of Jeremy AI, like, look at this. So I get to see at scale, like what the top questions are that people are having across all of them. I can. Of course, look at all of the individual questions that people have. I can look at the most common conversations in terms of topics that people are having with it. In addition to that, I get these pretty cool insights here that I can look through for each one of these. And anyway, my point being. That's an example of efficiency. So when I talk about like leverage inside of an offer, that's one example of it. Okay. In addition to that, like we've talked previously about what I call 'just digital Jeremy,' which is not Kate, outside of just the Telegram bot, keep in mind, we also have the Jeremy AI instance inside of the course portal itself, which is like voice and video calls. Or you can also message it there too. But yes, to your point, mainly inside of the Telegram bot is what we just discussed there, but it doesn't just include the Telegram bot. So can't stress it enough. When you look at that as an example. And like those are messages that people would have otherwise asked real Jeremy or asked staff that I would have had to hire. Right. Which would have made it more involved and less efficient. OK, so the do-it-yourself category, it's really important you understand. This is typically your drop cell class. Okay, that's the most important thing to understand. This isn't necessarily what you sell as like your primary thing, okay? It's something that just captures revenue that you otherwise would have missed out on in the instance that you didn't have it. So in my world, like, yeah, I'm happy to teach master internet marketing. I think it's an awesome thing for me to do. It makes sense. It's a really good training. It benefits people at the highest level. It benefits people in my consulting clients that we have. In some instances, it benefits you guys in the inner circle when you guys choose to actually go through that amount of information. So it's phenomenal class, to be clear, and it's great with what it does. But at the same time, like that's really not our ideal demographic. You know, our ideal demographic at a minimum is technically. Everything from here down. These are more of our ideal demographics. So in this example, you have to qualify. You have to make $100K a month or more just to be able to get into this. And then, with our done for you, like we have on our agency application, then it requires you to make 200K a month or more. But the reality of the situation is, is like almost everybody that we take on. Nowadays, especially, is doing like 500k a month plus. They kind of hate their marketer, or they you know feel like their marketer is not going to get them to the next level, or they got there organically and they want to start doing paid ads. You know, and then we take them on and we'll we'll scale them up, trying to get to a couple mil a month. Those are, again, those are ideal customers. Like, as an example, if you look at any of my YouTube content. All my YouTube content, I speak very clearly towards the 'done with you' and 'done for you' crowd, specifically. Those are, again, those are my ideal people that I want to work with. Okay. But at the same time. It's like, obviously, I get a fuckload of people that are not going to be considered qualified, but that attention is technically the largest part of it. Okay, I remember way back in the day. We had this, uh, this like pyramid structure. And we would always say, like, the base of the pyramid is intention. And then, from there, like, you have at the very top, this would be like our 'done for you' people. This is the smallest quantity of people. But again, this is where we technically make. Most money from by far, like by and large, as an organization, we clear the most out of that. Okay, and then from there, obviously, you descend lower and lower. We have our consulting, which, in our world, is still technically a done with. You and that's pretty good. Right? Does well, not as good as the done for you, of course. Then below that, we have the inner circle. Which is what you guys are sitting here a part of right now. And the inner circle is pretty good, you know. 5K a month. You got a business partner, 6K a month. And then, as I mentioned here, we have the do-it-yourself. Which, in our version, of this is the Master Internet Marketing Program. Okay, so to be clear, 5k one-time transactional price we make the least obviously off of attention we make fuck all but attention is what fuels everything so moral of the story is I represent this as a pyramid structure because what you'll notice is is the most room in the pyramid is the attention level and the do-it-yourself level Okay? This is what's important to understand. If you advertise... And you have strict qualifications throughout your lead forms or your applications. Or, you know, you just see like, as an example, 90 plus percent of people that opt in for a webinar don't show up or don't buy, etc. That goes to show. Not a very large quantity of people just aren't fit for the offers that you are specifically trying to push them towards. And as a result of that, you miss out on a substantial amount of cash. Okay, so we don't make like a fuckload off of like Leo unmute yourself. How many people you think we sell, like, just this month, as an example? On the Master Internet Marketing Program, like, 10, 15 maybe. Leo, yeah. Hello. I guess I should know the answer to that. My bad. All good. How many people do you think we sell, just this month, on the Master Internet Marketing Program? Ummm... Man, it's been a handful, probably. Close to 10? If I'm not mistaken, so far, I'll honestly have to go back to review. Sounds about right. So long story short, in that example, it's like, all right, so far, I got 10 people. We only do 5Ks. That's an extra 50K in revenue. That essentially subsidizes free ad spend for the month is how you can look at that. Or it subsidizes some payroll positions. Whatever you want to chuck it up as. It's like, or I can look at it like this. Like, you know, I spend 25K a month on just rent on the, on the P house. It's like, well, I can chalk it up as I got free rent now. You know? It's like, you see what I'm saying? This is just free money. It's not my ideal demographic. It's not people that I'm technically actively trying to sell to. But... It's the people, like if you go to my YouTube comments, it's a great example of this. The most common person that's commenting something is absolutely more qualified for master internet marketing than anything else. You understand? So anyway, I'm always I want to be really clear when I say this. OK, because this is this is one of these things that I think cannibalizes the higher ticket stuff for people right away is once you have. a lower ticket offer. Like once you have your version of an entry level, like do it yourself kind of offer. because it's there, you're likely going to start actively trying to promote it, which is a retard action. Okay. You do not want to take that action where you actively promote the downsell unless the intention is solely to do a low ticket to high ticket play. Okay? In my world, when I take people from master internet marketing and eventually ascend them to something like the inner circle or something higher than that, it takes... So long. Like it takes like months and months and months. Okay. And that is not an example of a low ticket product that would be intended to upsell somebody at a high rate. A much better example of a low ticket product, following the best practices that we've laid out historically inside of our weekly inner circle group call library, that you can go and watch if you haven't done so already. Is we would sell something much simpler than a master internet marketing offer, if our intention was to ascend people OK, with a low ticket offer, that would be something like maybe I throw together some of my content ad strategies into a low ticket offer. That'd be something like I sell some back-end selling strategies on the front end for like a couple hundred bucks, you know, and then maybe ascend them up to the master internet marketing or inner circle, et cetera. These are people that wouldn't have enough trust to just pull the trigger on the prices of these things. And they would want to buy something first to see a result with it and then ascend. Instead of doing that, we just do YouTube. OK, so I digress, though. The point I'm trying to make is. I do not want to actively cannibalize. the things that I actually want people to purchase. okay, by trying to promote the do-it-yourself offer. That's where a lot of people really fuck up. The do-it-yourself offer is when people are not qualified. for one of these things that waterfalls down okay so a great example of this: We just had a guy, he came into our agency application. which happens very frequently where somebody who we would consider unqualified comes through and, you know, look at this guy's application. Okay. Um, says he wants consulting services. Says he makes 203k a month. You know, says he does this shit. Uh, you know, claims that this is his ideal customer. I just read all this, and I'm like— Look, this guy, this Dylan guy, like he's going into the inner circle, right? Like I'm not. This is not a fucking client. This is not a consulting client. We're not taking on that deal. So I email him and I just go, 'Look, Inner Circle is going to be the best option for you to talk with Leo on.' And then he's in the middle of talking with Leo on. So my point is, your goal when you take people from whatever level they think they're at— is to descend them or ascend them to what is more probable to be beneficial for them. But obviously you got to have the stuff to be able to ascend and descend them through. Okay. So it's like a waterfall effect. It's like if somebody wants the done for you in that example, and they're not qualified for it. They could get bumped down to... Consulting. or the inner circle. Okay, and again, we get people all the fucking time. all the time that want the inner circle but they don't they don't answer one of the three qualifications correctly you gotta you gotta be willing to pay the 5k a month You got to be willing to commit for a year so I can actually get you a fucking banger result. And so you can go out there and represent the product the right way. We also have that as a point of friction. Because it's a limited offer. I don't want some dickhead who thinks they want to know one specific thing and that's all they need to know. That's never the case. You always need to know far more than whatever it is that they think they need. To know and then two, I'm sorry. Three, they obviously got to be making the minimum of 100k a month in that example to qualify for the inner circle. So the people who come through that application, without exaggeration, there's probably 80 plus percent of people who don't qualify for it based on those three things. So in that example, if I did not have my do-it-yourself offer, that's where the revenue would end. But instead, the people who are unqualified, bang. We drop them down to the do-it-yourself offer, the master internet marketing offer. And people purchase for that reason very frequently. They think they want something else, but that's not what we think makes more sense for them. You walk into a pizza shop. I want an extra, extra large pizza. They look at you and they're like, 'Sir, you're not. 90 pounds. You're by yourself. Are you taking this back to your family?' Oh, no. I plan on eating it right here, right now. It's like, well, sir, this isn't a challenge meal. You might be, to have one to two slices, you don't need that. Like, why not just buy a slice instead? Okay, you can also ascend and descend. People, as it makes more sense. Same pizza shop, a guy walks in, got two kids, says, 'Hey, I just need a small pizza.' They say, 'Sir, that small pizza, it's more of a personal pizza. It's meant for one person.' He's like, 'Well, that wouldn't work.' I got nine kids at home. They're like, 'Oh, dude, you need our fucking two extra large. Buy one, get one special that we throw a two liter on top of.' OK, it's like you can also go the opposite direction. Okay, so sometimes people will come through thinking they need this in our world. I'll give you a great example. We had a guy come through. He wanted to master internet marketing for seven of his staff. He has a big marketing team that he wanted to put through it. And guess how much this guy was making? He was making fucking $900,000 plus a month. And I was like, sir. I'm gonna keep it real—I don't think it makes much sense for you to go into master internet marketing. I think, for your own financial benefit, it makes a lot more sense for you to consider consulting. I think the consulting deal would give me a way to efficiently train everybody. At the same time, I'm going to still give them access to all the courses that you otherwise want to buy. Right now, but we get to do a weekly one-hour call together, and I'm essentially going to be like your outsourced CMO. I'm going to manage all these people for you and tell them what to do and hold them accountable to do it. I think that'd make you a lot more money, which I'm sure is why you're considering buying into that program in the first place. And he was like, 'Yeah, no, you're right.' It does make a lot more sense. And it's like, now we do a weekly call with that guy and we have a fuckload more involvement in his organization. Or sometimes we get an occasional person that comes through the inner circle application that we're like, 'Dude.' We would love to take you on as a client instead. You know, are you open for us just coming in and doing stuff for you? So people can ascend and descend. But again, the main lesson here is you have to have the levels. You have to have the offers there that make the most sense. And then the reason I drew this little pyramid structure down here for you guys, look at the real estate here. Okay, there's the least room at the top. Okay, it's like we have the fewest quantity of world leaders on earth. Right, but there's far more people who are just impoverished, right— at the very, very lowest levels of the game, well, that's where the most people fit. That's where the most real estate is, right? They don't make fucking cliffside mountain mansions for every person on earth. You know, they only make that for a select few that can get to that level in the first place. There's just not that much real estate for that specific class. You understand? The point I'm trying to make is due to the fact, just like real life real estate. The fewer that you can deliver for, the higher the price goes, respective to the amount of real estate available. So it's like, dude, I can make YouTube videos all day. Twice a week. I'll drop those for free. Right. And I'll get the most attention out of anything else. Right. I can post shorts and reels and just, again, garner attention. That's where the most people will fit. There's no cost to it. You do that all day long. The inner circle, it's like, dude, there's only so many people that fit in a mastermind. There's only so many people I can do one-on-one calls with. You understand? There's only so many people that we want in that group. So as the real estate fills up, what happens to real estate? As the supply diminishes? Somebody put it in the chat. What happens to real estate as the supply diminishes? Doesn't matter what level of the game you're at. If there's, as an example, down here— right there's more two to four hundred thousand dollar homes in the United States than there are any other class of home. Okay. That real estate doesn't ever really run out. There's large swaths of land in almost every country where they can build $200,000 to $400,000 homes all day long. Right, give or take zoning restrictions and limitations that might drive the price up. But like, there's a fuckload of that supply. That class of homes, it rarely ever exceeds its historical average median price. It goes up year over year just because of inflation more than anything else. It doesn't really go up because supply contracts. It only goes up just because money loses value. That is really the only thing. So people think their houses are going up in value when they buy that. but it's not true. It's just the dollar losing value against the value of their home. So this class doesn't really ever need to go up in price unless the dollar diminishes, right? So like my master internet marketing class at 5K, it's like, well, that'll probably be 5K until I feel like the dollar is worth less than what it was and I want to charge more to get the equivalent of what 5K was when I first started charging 5K. You understand? That doesn't really need to move. Right? How many of you have seen firsthand the quantity of price jumps that we've had for the inner circle? Right. It's like that real estate now that that my friend that is an upper class neighborhood that does have a limited quantity of homes in it. It's got a nice private school nearby. But again, there's a limited quantity of kids that we can put into that school. It's pretty exclusive. And as the value of that specific real estate gets driven up because the supply diminishes, the price of this can go up dramatically, relative to the supply. You understand? So because there's limitations. It's the same thing with consulting offers. So my done with you is my Inner Circle program, which obviously you guys are all familiar with that offer, up to twice a month one-on-one calls, weekly group calls, quarterly masterminds in the group chat. And then obviously you get access to AI Jeremy with no limitations. Okay, very efficient and then the higher level version of our done with you Consulting. You get the inner circle and everything that comes with it. But instead of twice a month. One-on-one calls last 30 minutes, you get a weekly one-hour call at a preferential time. OK, now to be clear. The difference there is that, as we get very limited supply, as the supply gets taken up, the price goes up. The qualifications go up. The friction goes up. I can still make more money off of those two offers. As the supply contracts. I don't need to build more homes. You understand? I can just let the supply carry me. To a higher level of richness. You understand? Now, I'm going to take a moment and just answer some questions that are here in the chat that I see before we continue. Simone says, 'This is what my team is struggling with, realizing that do it yourself is where most of my will fall, but having trouble efficiently converting those leads.' Yeah, and this is really important. This is actually a really good point, Simone. Let me make this really clear, okay? So I had a guy just the other day. He says, 'Hey, Jeremy, I have this problem.' And he essentially just describes an ad fatigue problem. Long story short. And I was like, 'Yeah, sick dude.' Like buy the Master Internet Marketing Program. I go through ad fatigue like immediately and I can send you the SOP for it as soon as you buy. And he was like, 'Yeah,' but, you know, it's not really what I want. You know, I. I really want the inner circle. Like I want the higher level trainings and, you know, I want to be around those people and like, oh, I want to come to the masterminds. And I'm like. 'Okay, great,' like, did you apply? And he's like, 'Yeah,' but you know, I wasn't qualified. I'm not. I'm not at $100K a month yet. You know, I was at $100K a month. And then he describes like an $80,000 to $130,000 a month range that he was in. And I was like, 'Well, yeah,' you're not qualified for that. Like, why not get master internet marketing? It helps you solve the exact problem you just described. And this guy, listen to this crazy shit. This guy was spending $30,000 a month on ads. Okay. And I was like, 'Dude. You're still in a position where you can benefit tremendously from master internet marketing. And he was like, 'Yeah, you know, but it's just not really what I want. You know, I really want like the higher level thing. And so I sent him back this voice note. I go... This is what keeps people poor, okay? This is this exact mindset. You have resources right in front of you right now that you can use and deploy to help solve your problem. And it's a measly $5,000. Okay. It's a measly five grand.' The amount of value you will receive literally just from the ad fatigue protocol alone. Far exceeds $5,000. OK, and instead you are choosing to put resources off for the future. Like you're talking about future resources that we will literally not let you buy. Until you qualify to be able to buy them and even then, your current mindset a dumpster fire. You think I'm gonna let you in there around a fuckload of rich people when you think like this, like this isn't how rich people think. They use what's in front of them right now and they take advantage of it. And then the guy proceeds to buy. Okay, so my point is, Simone: Here's the number one struggle that you're going to have when you descend somebody. OK, so when you take them, let's say that Dylan guy is an example that I showed you guys. He wanted done for you. Technically, he wanted our consulting offer. I don't really want Dylan as a consulting client. I think he'd be much better in the inner circle. I think it just makes more sense for him. And again, I want to be really clear when I say this: for his own financial benefit, I believe that's the best place for him to be. Okay. I think that's also where I can get him the most results. And I think it's more efficient. In comparison to a consulting deal. Okay, now to be clear: In that case, he was open to it. Okay, but again, just like the other guy I described, I don't remember the other guy's name. He wants the inner circle. He does not want master internet marketing. So that actually becomes the biggest objection. is I want this higher level thing. I don't want the lower level thing. And they perceive it as the lower level thing. And they're not technically wrong. Like, let me give you an example, okay? Like in this concept of the real estate that I'm communicating to you. If you guys, and I'm sure all of you would like to do this, you all want to live in some super fucking sick spec mansion somewhere dope, you know? You want a nice view, right? Like, I bet... Very, very, very little of you on this call would prefer to live in the suburbs of like Indiana or Nebraska with like a, I don't know, small property that costs $200,000. I just highly doubt that any of you would have that as your preference. OK, now to be clear, it's not there's anything wrong with that. It's just at the end of the day, like you don't really want to be at that level. You know what I mean? You don't want to do that. So as a result of not wanting to do that, it's like. you're probably just not going to do it at all. You understand? And that's going to become the biggest objection. Is well, we all want super sick spec mansions. But can we all currently afford super sick spec mansions with views in a dope place? You see, so it's like instead. We afford what we currently afford. Right. It's like I don't know about you guys— put into the chat your answer here. Do you like where you currently live, even though it's not the place that you aspirationally dream of in the future? Like, do you still enjoy where you currently live today, based on what you can currently afford? Yes or no? Put it into the chat. OK, because to be clear, that's technically your version of a drop sell that you've purchased. You see, so it's like, listen, I still love living in the penthouse. right? It's like, I still love living in this little townhouse too as a second home. It's great. But let me be clear. It's like, this isn't what I dream of, you know, but I still, I still live where I live and I still love where I live. It's like, dude, my current cars are fucking sick. Okay, like, they're really good. Do I want... Uh, Cohen, Sig, Jesko. Yeah! Like, do I want a Bugatti? Sure. Yeah, I could. I could have a Bugatti. Do I want like... The Rolls Royce Mansory Phantom for like 800 grand instead of my Rolls Royce Ghost for like 250. Yeah, sure. But it's like, again, am I still super satisfied with where I currently am? Yeah, for sure. But do I still dream bigger? Yeah. You see, now look at this, right? You understand this? It's like none of you want to look at what you currently afford as a drop sell. I guarantee none of us currently frame how we currently live. As purchasing the drop cell but that's the reality of our situations. You understand? Really think about that. That's the reality of your situation. When your leads frame being drop sold as a drop cell, it's going to be a huge contention point. It's going to be a huge point of friction, a big objection. Very, very low odds a person purchases when they're in that frame. Very high probability that people purchase what's actually best for them now when that's how it's framed. This is just what makes most sense for you for where you're currently at. It's like you want to afford the best that you can currently afford. When it's framed like that, you have a much higher probability to get the person to actually buy that drop sell. So Simone, long story short, what your people need to be trained on is that exact point there. They have to be able to reframe the drop cell as, 'Listen, man, this just is what makes the most sense for you based on where you're currently at.' Right? This is actually what you need. That other thing, I don't think it would make sense for you. You essentially have to talk them out of whatever they're unqualified for. It's like, let's keep it real, guys. At the end of the day, could I literally right now go and afford $100,000 a month home? Yeah, fuck yeah, I could. Heh heh heh! Fuck yeah, I could. Okay? Am I currently spending $100,000 a month on a home? No. No, I spend about $31,000 in a month between the two homes I have now. I'm 69% off. Okay. Could I? Again, could I get the $100,000 a month home? Yeah, for sure. Does that make the most sense? No. Would I stretch myself thin? No, not really. I mean, to be honest, I definitely could. But it just doesn't make sense. It just doesn't make any sense. You see, so it's like, well, instead of looking at it like, 'Oh man, I'm impoverished,' you know, I only live in a penthouse and a second home in the same city, you know, 'Oh man.' It's like, well, that's not how I look at it. You know, it's like, well, I just— I still have a great life. I still have great stuff. You see, that's the key. You understand? It's like you have to talk yourself out of. whatever it is that you think you actually want. And that happens all the time in the buying process. That happens all the time. Imagine just being homeless until you could afford a mansion. You see, it's like— that doesn't make any fucking sense. But people do that all the time with your stuff. They want the mansion and instead they go homeless instead of buying the modest home that actually makes more sense for them. You see, your people got to be better trained. Okay, Vince says, out of curiosity, where did you start the pricing for IC when you first began offering it as an option compared to the agency and MIM? So way back in the day, Vince, this is like 2019 when the Inner Circle very first came out. It was $1,500 a month and it was a different offer. Like, we didn't do the weekly group calls. We didn't do the amount of one-on-one calls. We did like one one-on-one call. And in addition to that, I've had masterminds where I've had literally just one person there. Shout out to Sean. Who came to one of the mansion, came to one of the, when I very first launched, I had a little penthouse on a little island called North Bay Village. And we've had masterminds with like six people at it, five people at it. This is like the first, probably full year of the first offer. And then around 2020, we started taking the offer a lot more seriously. And that's just, again, as the real estate diminished, that's where we drove it up to the price that it's at currently. And we have people right now, by the way, the newest people that joined in, they pay upwards of $7,500 a month. As a result of Again, just to be really clear, supply and demand. There's a very limited quantity of people that we have left to be able to sell this to. So as a result of that, the price just keeps going up. The cool thing is, is just like yesterday as a great example. What's his name, Brett? Brett joins into the group. And no, no, I'm sorry, Brian. Brian joins into the group. And, you know, Brian's already doing a mil a month, like, you know, him paying a higher rate. He's going to make a fuckload of money off this offer. You know, a fuckload immediately. You understand? It's like if I help Brett, I'm sorry, if I help Brian make an extra 10%, you know, he's making an extra 100 grand a month at a million a month. You know, if I help a guy who's at 100K a month join in, make 10%, he's making 10K a month extra, which would still pay for that. So anyway, long story short. Um, Yeah, that answers your question. Okay, Daniel, at what point do you adjust the filtering on lead quality to allow for less qualified people for the lower offers? Or do you run separate campaigns completely? Yeah, great question, Daniel. So here's how it works. So first of all, let's use the example that you are marketing one of the things that you actually want to market, which for you might be like you're done for you. Or you might have a page where you are marketing your done with you offers. OK, so to be clear, in either one of these examples, let's just say they push to an application and inside of that application, you have some qualifying questions. So one of the one of the pieces of advice that I give very frequently that people really misinterpret is how lead filtering works. So as an example. When we get somebody that fills out, let's say our agency application, the very first question is, 'Do you make 200K a month?' Okay. And if the answer is no, they immediately get routed to the inner circle application. They get routed to the Inner Circle sales page that links to the Inner Circle application. In the Inner Circle application, the very first qualifying question is, 'Do you make $100K a month?' If the answer is no, they get routed to the Master Internet Marketing page. You see, now there's two ways you could do that. You could do it the way I just articulated, which is. The people who are qualified. Right, they get routed to one specific, obviously where you're going to capture them and allow them to book. And obviously, you're going to pixel these people and send that data back. And then the other group of people— these are the people who aren't qualified. And the unqualified people, you can choose to still capture these people's information. So you can capture the information if you want to. You don't have to. You could do, for example, like what I articulated. where we'll just route them to the other thing that's more appropriate for them. And if they choose not to apply from that point forward, like it is what it is. They're just gone. Now you could argue, and it would make a lot of sense to argue this, if I still capture that person's information. Based on what they wanted. And then we routed them to, as an example, a salesperson or a setter. Somebody who has... you know, less like they deal with the less serious leads in your business. Okay, this person could then drop sell. So you could do it in two ways. You could either route to the offer that's more appropriate for them, like how I do it in mine. Or like I said, if you want to sell to more people, it would actually make a lot more sense to still capture them. But then you got to be really good at being able to articulate why that drop sell is more appropriate for the person when they do actually get in communication with you. So that's the way that you handle that, to be clear. So on yours, do you route them like literally to a different landing page or do they just see different questions? No, we route them straight up to it. So as soon as they answer a question unqualified, it immediately routes them over to the more appropriate offer for them for that specific sales page. So if they are filling out the inner circle application, they answer any of the three qualifying questions in the wrong way. They just instantaneously get dejected from the application and they get routed to the sales page for master internet marketing. Okay. Correct. Yep. And then I also want to be very clear when I say this. Just recently, we've had... We filmed this video earlier this week. We plan on implementing this this upcoming week. We have a video that articulates. Just like what I just told you guys, instead of just driving them to the main master internet marketing sales page, it'll be the main master internet marketing sales page just with a different video and a slightly different headline at the top. So it'll essentially position it as, 'Hey, this currently makes more sense for you.' Here's why. And then we'll break it down. So the context, I think, will help sell even more people on it when they get routed there. But I can't stress it enough. You could still capture the person's information and just route it to your salespeople. Let the salespeople know, 'Hey, this person wasn't qualified for this offer.' Make sure you talk to them about this offer instead. And obviously, we could then have marketing automation that communicates to them properly and just does all of that selling for us. We could have a confirmation page that communicates those same kind of frames, et cetera. We could still leverage all the if this, then that logic. Okay, Pierre says, does the word of mouth exposure about your lower ticket ever cannibalize someone that could have potentially bought IC, but they chose to buy MIM because it existed? For us specifically, Pierre, no, the inner circle, believe it or not, actually has way more notoriety than any other offer that we currently have. And as a result of that, it kind of does the opposite. Like we get people who are unqualified—those who want to wait until they're qualified— to buy the inner circle. And in reality, like I just articulated, those people would make a lot more sense to currently buy Master Internet Marketing. And not just for my own financial benefit, to be clear. I'm not trying to virtue. Signal—I want to be really kind of say it's like it does make a lot more fucking sense for those people to buy Master Internet Marketing because that will help them get to the point where they are qualified for the inner circle and that'll also just help them financially period, based on where they're at. So yeah, for us, it's actually kind of the opposite. Christian says, just for clarification, you don't run ads for the 'done, do-it-yourself' offer, rather just downsell the leads from the 'done' for you or the 'done with you'. Yeah, so, and this is a really good question, Christian. You get to choose, okay? You do get to choose. So based on the logic of real estate, okay, it just depends on your model. I like it. Where I am at a point of leverage within my offers to have the cards in my hand, okay? What I mean by that is... is like I want to pretty much be maxed out on 'done for you' offers. I want to be pretty much maxed out on consulting offers. I want to be pretty much maxed out on inner circle offers. Why? Because that's where I have my most leverage. That's where I can crank the fuck out of the price. and not care if the person buys or not, because there's going to be another sales call tomorrow. You know, that's where it just makes the most sense. You see, I prefer to have the leverage, which comes from being maxed out. So in my world, it's like every YouTube video I'll ever make, I'm talking about. the inner circle. I'm talking about done for you. I pepper in the master internet marketing offer because again, there's more of these types of people that watch. Okay, but I'm talking in my videos to these people. These are the people that I'm pitching most and that I'm talking to directly. I'll just pepper in, hey, by the way, we got this for those of you that aren't there yet. You know what I mean? And then I will also be very clear when I say this now. Could I advertise for my done for you or my done with you offers when I'm already close to being maxed out? Yeah, I could. I absolutely could. It would just put me in that position where I'm likely just going to charge more money to the people who actually respond to those offers and want them, which is a great thing to do. It's a great problem to have. Again, that comes from being close to being maxed out. That's where you have that leverage. Now, does it make more sense? Because it's far more scalable. This specific offer. The master internet marketing offer in this example, this does make the most sense to advertise and to sell the most people into because it's a one-time transactional offer. It has the most scale potential out of anything else that I could run. And I could sell the most people into it. Right? Personally, I want to be really clear when I say this. This is also really important to understand. This. is transaction. bag. These... are all recurring. So if I told you every month I wake up with just damn near a million a month in recurring revenue. Right. Versus in comparison, if I had to wake up the next month and go generate another million dollars in new recurring and new revenue. I would take the recurring every day of the week. That'd be where my attention stays. We just take the transactional stuff as it comes, as a downsell solely based on that belief system. Okay. That's up to you. Not everybody, I want to be clear, not everybody who has a done for you offer has a recurring done for you offer. Not everybody that has a done with you offer has a recurring done with you offer. As an incredible piece of counsel, I would absolutely advise you figure out how to justify your offer to be recurring. Right. Because then this. Become scalable. Man, what is going on with my brain? Scalable. And then this becomes your leverage. This becomes where you just charge a lot more money as it can. Again, as the real estate diminishes, you just charge a fuckload more. But it's also still recurring, which is tremendous. OK, so up to you for how you how you justify and how you offer yours. But that's how I do it for mine. Okay, and then Simone says, Christian, you got a follow-up question on that? Go ahead. Yeah, I just thought I would meet him. Can you hear me all right? Because I'm driving right now. No, you're good. All right, so I was wondering, because I'm pretty good, by the way, at every single point right now. And I feel like I should have an offer as well to now sell people onto. But a little scared as well to not, like you mentioned, cannibalize the main offer. So what price point, let's say the done with you is 15K. What a price point should be. Like a downsell and I'm even thinking about possibly a an upsell. Uh, so what price points would you put them at and also, in terms of value offer. What should we offer them to make sure that the people that we're going to buy are done with you? Do not end up like just buying a lower tier because they see it as more value. If that makes any sense. Tremendous question. So pricing— pricing absolutely determines that. OK, so you're right in thinking that. And that's a solid question. So let me give you an example. When the inner circle reached the $7. 5K a month price. Okay. Are done for you offer, historically, was it $15K a month? Plus. A 10% net rev share. Now, when you look at those two and you're like, well. Hold on, you know, I could just buy. The done for like this guy could just do all this shit for me for an extra seven and a half grand a month. You know, like, why wouldn't I do that instead? But again, we have far less people. That we can fit into that. So what do you do in that example? Well, instead of charging the 15K, we started charging 20K a month. And we made that a higher price as a result. Okay, so without even necessarily having more people sold into the 'done for you' offer, the price of the 'done for you' offer went up. We actually launched a guy on Sunday at $20K a month. Same thing, 10% net rev shit. Okay, now let me be clear when I say this. The price of master internet marketing in this example. That. is currently sitting at a 5K one-time price. So that's just a one-time cost. Now, let me show you something that might. add a little spice to this example for you so you can see how cool this gets so we have our consulting offer that we got to factor into this too. So consulting. Historically, has been 15k a month. No Rev Share. Okay, so now for consulting. We have the price. at 20k a month No rev shit. So then the question becomes, okay, do I want to do consulting or do I want to do done for you and just add the rev share component to it? In most instances, believe it or not for us, the main differentiator between a consulting offer and a done-for-you offer isn't actually price. It's the fact they already have a team they believe in that they just want somebody to come in and train at a very high level and then hold accountable. So. The drop in rev share, but at the same price, makes a lot of sense for them. Okay. Now. Let me also stress this very clearly. The popcorn analogy. All right. So you have small. Yeah, medium. And you have large. I'm sure you've seen this before. They'll price the small at like $4. They'll price the medium at $8. And they'll price the large at like $8. 50. And in that example, the dummy offer is the media. They don't really want anybody buying. You kind of got to be stupid to buy the media. You know, like they'd rather make that extra little 50 cent clip off you. and have you buy a large one, if you really only want a small one. It's like I mean, you're still paying four bucks for popcorn. You know, they're still fucking you there, which is a great price for them. But to be clear, they have a dummy price at the media. OK, in this same example, if they actually wanted more people to buy the medium, they would have to adjust the prices accordingly. They'd probably keep the large at eight. And they'd probably have a more proportional offer like this. Where in this case, the decision is no longer just price. The decision is the size. You see, so to be clear, again, in this example. What determines the decision is the price of the offer. Okay. And in this example, what determines it is the size or the amount of popcorn that you want in comparison. You see how price can affect the psychology of buying. Okay, so for us, it's like we're always happy to have people buy master internet marketing. Okay, we're totally cool with that. That makes a lot of sense for us. Okay, that's like our version of a small popcorn. Right. And then we have the inner circle. Again, the most efficient thing that we can do in the 'done with you' category is consulting. We can do very little of that. It's also very important to note: every single time we get a consulting deal. We raised the price. Okay, every single time. And then it's the same thing for our done-for-you offers. We're very, very, very close to being maxed out on our consulting and done-for-you offers. So every time somebody buys, the price goes up. OK, in that example, it's not just a question of price. It's kind of a combination. It's both price and, well, what do I want? You know, and in some instances, it's also what they qualify for. So to answer your question, like very directly. Very important to note, okay? You must consider that price can sabotage one product being purchased over another. And then the stuff that you do in the offer, that's your version of size in this case, like the movie theater popcorn example. That can also sabotage one thing being purchased over another. But back to the simplest thing. Remember, The more involved that somebody wants you to be, aka the more they just want you to do this stuff. I want to be really clear on this. This is actually a very foundational point that I have not touched on yet. I really want to emphasize this. Every single one of these offers does the same exact thing. Just with different levels of involvement and how the result is produced. They all do the exact same fucking thing. Am I done for you? I'm coming in and doing it for you. It's technically the speed of the result that you're purchasing. I have a much higher probability to get you a result a lot faster the more involved I am. Okay, simple as that. So it's like. I just had this client. The guy was telling you about that we're going to launch on Sunday. He was telling me just the other day, he was like, 'Hey man, I just filmed all these ad videos and the breakout videos for you. Let me know if you need my team to do anything with the funnel over the weekend for changes.' All of them, I go, 'Hey man,' so I'll let you know, like, you bought 'done for you.' Like, you don't got to do shit. You know, like, what you just filmed is probably all I'm going to need for you for this entire month. Like, from here, just focus on your sales team and make sure they close leads as they come in. You don't got to do anything, dude. Just kick back and relax. And he was like, 'Oh.' Yeah, sick, you know? My point being is like, You're buying speed and involvement, but all of these have the same outcome. The consulting and the inner circle and the done with you category, they have the same outcomes. You all want the same outcomes as my done for you offer. You all want to get to a million dollars a month. Okay. You all want to make a fuckload more money. And how do you want to make more money? The same things that I'm going to do on a done-for-you offer. Right? The same exact stuff. You're just doing it yourself and I'm doing it with you. You understand? And then the do-it-yourself category of master internet marketing, well, I'm just teaching all this stuff and it just takes far fucking longer to get the result, right? And your probability for getting the result is dramatically diminished the lower down the ladder you go. Because in that example, it's like it takes a long fucking time. It takes a long time to be able to go through all the information. But let me be clear. It's like these are all the same outcome. Just different levels of speed and different levels of involvement. You understand? That's the difference. It's like you guys literally right here right now. As a group, you're asking questions, you're getting value. It's like I'm explaining all this stuff for you. If you did a 'done for you' offer, like you wouldn't even have to talk about that— we would just do it. Well, you wouldn't have to educate yourself and then go do it. We would just do it. Understand? It's the same result. It's just the speed and and the level of involvement that's it. That's all it is. They all have the same outcome. So, when you think with this stack of offers, that's specifically what you need to be thinking with. Does that make sense? Yeah, I have a follow-up question regarding price as well. So, I'm assuming for the three offers. How would you go about tracking data in terms of, what from Vice? And then also, how would you know, based on that data, if an offer is kind of like sabotaging a bigger offer? For example, like if... If a client that was potentially going to buy a higher premium offer is now buying a lower offer just because we priced it wrong or we're offering different things. How would you look at that? How would you structure the data? How would you look at it as well? Well, you're going to know it from the sales calls. Like, I don't understand how you're going to miss that data. Like, nobody's buying your stuff on the internet. Without going through a salesperson, correct? Yeah, correct, but, um... I look at it. I don't look at the sales calls too. I don't look at every single sales call. That my salespeople take. So I um I look more at data and type of stuff. Yeah. Hey, Jeremy, how am I going to know the color of the sky? Oh, you got to just look at the sky. OK, but I don't ever look at the sky. Okay, listen to the fucking sales calls. Like, what the fuck don't you get? Like, you go and you look. You know, it's not tough to see. You literally have to look at the data or you have to trust your people to be able to relay the data to you. Okay. Salespeople are really good because they have an incentive to sell something at a more costly rate because they make more money in commission at telling you when they're losing money because you're doing something wrong that's forcing people to buy the lower ticket thing. So hopefully your salespeople are like that and they're just going to tell you. But yeah, other than that, you literally just have to look. You can't omit listening to sales calls and looking at sales calls, especially in the age of AI. Like Christian, pay attention to the group chat. Like seven times this week, we've talked about... Artificial intelligence reviewing sales calls and giving you, as the sales manager, feedback on those sales calls as a result of having AI review them. Okay, have you been paying attention to that stuff? Probably missed one or two messages. Say what? I said I probably miss those messages. Yeah, so moral of the story is, is like, have... Your people run and record their sales calls. Let me give you an example. What that looks like, so you can see. This is from this from a consulting client. OK, so this specific consulting client, this is after they ran all of their sales calls for the time frame that you see here, May 1st to June 16th. They just transcribed every single sales call. And they threw it into an artificial intelligence software. And they were just like, 'Yeah, like you know, tell us some specific things.' So the things that they told it to look for, like just actionable insights and recommendations. So the first one was lead quality is the biggest lever for growth. And then it articulated some very specific things that could be actionable for marketing. It talked about one of the biggest objections is— that the partner is not there. And so it made sure to give some insights into talking about making sure that, like, the person's spouse was there or and or their business partner in this case. Resonant messaging and client motivation. So this one was actually quite interesting. So for these people specifically, this is a cutout alcohol offer. And it said, you know, a lot of the front end communication that we have is centric around. How money relates to drinking. And so if you cut out drinking, you make more money. And that does attract a very good, financially qualified person. But what happens on the sales calls is that the lead brings up health and relationships more than they bring up money. So long story short, in this specific instance, a lot of the sales messaging that the sales management is going to make sure to train the staff on is not just the money hooks, but also on the health and relationship hooks. But we're not going to take that and do the front end. We're going to tweak that specifically for the backend. OK, and then again, long story short, it's like you get a nice list of things like this. So, if you're and I'm not sitting here telling you, Christian, like you need all the time in the world to obviously go and sit on fucking sales calls all day and listen to sales calls. I'm not—I'm not—I'm not retarded. I know you guys aren't going to do that. But having every sales call recorded, and then throwing every single one of those transcripts into something as simple as ChatGPT or into something as simple as Claude, and like just prompting it properly on asking for insights into the sales conversations. That can give you a lot of the insights that you're looking for. And in your case specifically, just based on the question you asked, you can literally ask it that. You could say, in the prompt, 'Can you identify any potential leads that purchased a lower ticket product that should have or could have bought a higher ticket product? And if so, how many times out of these total calls that were fed into you? Um, did that occur? And that could give you the insight that you're looking for in like a percentage, uh, with some additional context on like when it happened and why it happened too. So that's another great way to be able to do it. But again, have to look, regardless of whether it's an efficient way like that, whether it comes from your sales team, or whether it literally comes from just jumping on the calls, or even if it comes from sales management, you have to actually look. Does that make sense to you, Christian? Does that answer your question? Totally. Totally. Yeah. Okay. Very good. And then make sure you stay on top of the chat. Obviously in the inner circle, the number one variable that dictates your guys' success is consumption. You have to be able to consistently consume and consistently apply in order to consistently make a fuckload of cash from this. Okay, cool. Let's see. I think there's some other questions here. I've been thinking about starting my pitch with my 'done with you' offer on my weekly webinar instead of my 'do-it-yourself' offer. Do you think pitching a deposit for the 'done with you' on the webinar is better or just book a call? I've tried book a call, and people wouldn't show. Yeah. So how much is that? Simone, can you unmute yourself real quick if it's possible, or just type into the chat if it's not possible? How much is the 'done with you' offer and how much is the 'do it yourself' offer? Yeah, yeah. So the 'done with you' offer is $4,800. And then the 'do it yourself' offer, we're offering that at $1,000 for lifetime access. It's basically, it's just a course in a community. Understood. Are the people who come through to your webinars currently, do you think they're qualified for the done with you offer? Or are you thinking that they're not and that's why you're pitching only 1K? yeah yeah it depends right because a lot of people that come like they're like they don't even have 40 a month to pay right that come to the workshop so that's that's why i'm a little You know, I've tried to do it before where we pitch like, hey, book a call for this higher offer and then people wouldn't show. So I'm like, OK, maybe we try this again with a done with you, but have people put down a deposit. On the actual call. That way we can, you know, obviously get intent, have them save their spots. And then go that way. But yeah, I mean, when I'm doing these workshops, right, it's people trying to get into tech, you know, they might be working retail, they might not have much money. So we haven't started trying this pitch—yet. So I can look at the numbers. Um, but we have been having a hard time getting people to ascend from 'done with you' up. So Simone, check this out. So yeah, if if you still sold the do-it-yourself offer, but every person who purchased the do-it-yourself offer, you had a mandatory like onboarding call that they had to schedule and that call was with your sales people. You could then have the salespeople act as, here, let me welcome you in and show you everything. And then, you know, hey, by the way, we've got this other thing. And in the instance you're ever interested in this other thing, we can credit the 1K purchase that you've made towards this other thing. It doesn't have to be like a high-pressure sell. It can just be like a mandatory call to make everybody aware of it. And then naturally, you're going to get a certain percentage, which would be cool to see what it comes out to be, that naturally will upsell. You just credit the cost of what they've already purchased towards that done-with-you offer. Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah, that was my idea. We tried that, and, like, we started getting people that would want their money back. I don't know if it was how the sales... Yeah, like they would come off the call and they're like, 'I didn't know I was going to have to pay another 4K. Like I want my money back.' You don't want to frame it down. It sounds like a framing issue for sure. So you want to make— make sure you reaffirm, like, 'Hey, you got an incredible thing here.' I'm going to ship reform, like attempting to, you know, upsell you or like diminish what you currently bought. I just want to make you aware of like other resources that we have available for you if you ever do need them. And sometimes people, they don't even know that these exist. So it's— The call, a majority of that call, to be clear, should be spent on walking the person through what they just purchased, like reducing buyer's remorse, emphasizing, and just walking through literally what they purchased and showing its value. And then the second part of that is, is just, hey, and by the way, it's a minority of the call by far. Hey, and by the way, Simone. I have all these other resources available to you in the instance that you ever need this additional stuff. Here's specifically what those things cover. And by the way, what you just purchased, we will literally use as a credit towards these other things in the instance that you do ever choose to ascend on that and get these additional trainings. Yeah. And that's it. That was the way that I was like. So when I was talking to the sales team, they weren't framing it like that. They were making it seem like this first thing that you got, it's not good enough. You don't have the skills like making people feel really bad about themselves to try to get them to. Don't do that. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, I mean, I think this is a sales team issue. Yeah, 100% it is. Yeah, based off of this, do you think we should still just pitch the 1K and then just... have the yeah it sounds i mean based on how you i mean look i have a very limited amount of database yeah articulated to me there but it's it sounds like you have just a very unqualified person coming on to the call in the I'm sorry, coming on to the webinar in the first place. So it's important to just do math, though, because technically, you know, one of the done with you offers is, you know, four times the value of. the, of the do it yourself offer. And I want to be clear. I say it's like— I like the idea of you pitching the 'do it yourself' offer in this case. And ascending people like just telling them, like, like, as an example, right? You go buy a car. It's like, if the salesperson said, 'Oh, by the way, that car is a piece of um i i think you're pretty impoverished, you know, from buying that car.' I think it makes more sense for you to purchase this nicer car instead. It's like, well, you're going to be like, 'Dude, give me my fucking money back. I don't want a piece.' Exactly. But it's like, again, now listen to this framing, right? It's like, if you did try to sell the nicer car first. Right. And you made the nicer car. Out to be a very nice car and then you were like, and by the way, you know, we have this more like entry-level car that you can purchase if like money's an issue here. Um again, it's still going to kind of lend that same kind of frame of like, all the the lesser car is lesser and like, I don't really, lesser, like, like I said, can you go buy wherever you live right now? They don't like the agent doesn't frame it as, 'Hey, like, I know you want a mansion, but like, 'Hey, this is where you're at right now.' Instead, you know, they don't frame it like that. You know, it's like you buy what you can buy. And then you have, you have aspirations. Like you're fully aware of what things that are nicer than what you currently own cost. Right. You're fully aware of those prices. And when it makes sense for you to ascend to those things, you ascend to them. You understand? So it's like, that's the intention of that call. And I think, based on what it sounds like your demographic is currently framed as, I think that makes more sense for you to go with the lower tier first and then, you know, talk highly of the things that they can get to and, you know, talk about how you just send them. Just like if you bought a home or if you bought a car, if you bought a watch, like you can go trade it in. You know, get a credit towards the thing that you're trying to buy next. Does that make sense? Right. Exactly. Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. I think that would make more sense for you just based on your demographic. And then this is all a really good point for everybody else is like the, the, the demographic you're selling to like that determines. What technically makes the most sense to do, whether it starts to go at the lower end of the spectrum and work your way up, or whether it starts to go at the higher end of the spectrum and work your way down. Does that make sense? It's very demographic-dependent that kind of answers that question. Okay, Vince has a question about done-for-you RevShare clients. Do leads ever get hesitant in the sales process or in the first one to two months about rev share percentage if the results aren't huge right off the bat? No, for us, Vince, the way that we work, we do a net rev share. So for us, let me just give you a simple example for our 20K a month, 10% rev share clients. They don't pay us rev share until they get above $200,000 a month net because we deduct the fee from what's owed on the rev share. So as an example, if they net $100,000 in the first 30 days off of actions that are trackable back to us. Well, they just paid the fee because in that example, 10% of $100,000 is $10,000, but they already paid $20,000 for the month. So again, the rev share doesn't exceed the fee. Let's use the example they net $300,000 a month. If they net $300,000 a month, that's $30,000 they owe us. $30,000 minus the $20,000 they already paid, and the fee would leave a difference of $10,000 in that example. So essentially, it becomes like an either or structure once they exceed, you know, in this case, a net threshold of $200,000. So that's how we justify our offer in that case to make it make more sense. Tarn says, 'How do you determine when it's time to implement done with you or do it yourself for a done for you heavy agency? Yeah, so Tarn, this is also a great question, right? Like when does it technically make sense to have all these different structures in place? I deeply believe it makes sense damn near right away. Okay, because here's the thing that's really important to understand. With. The done-for-you offer, okay, remember, it's like, let's just look at this pyramid again, but let's look at it. With only the done for you. Okay. So in this example, it's like you still have the smallest quantity of people that can fit up here. And it's like, that's all you're selling. Right now, just imagine the rest of the entire amount of land and real estate available— you just never sell. Right. It's like, well, what I mean, what happens to all those people? What happens to those people is, is technically from there, this is how your pyramid would look. Right. And so. you're only making money in that example off of that done for you. And you're not making any money off of all that attention. OK, so there's there's some instances where. give or take the brand. it doesn't necessarily make a lot of sense. to offer literally anything else. OK, I'm going to give you an exam. So we have. Later today. A tiny plane. That's going to this place called Little Palm Island. Okay, and Little Palm Island. is a resort down in the Keys. It's an island, first of all. When you show up, you take that little ferry that you see there over to the island. There are 30 total rooms. On this little island here. Okay. And that's it. Just 30. Now the rooms range with three different types of rooms. The base level room that they have is like two thousand something dollars a night. Okay, it's still not cheap. The... more costly rooms that they have. are their grand sweets, is what they're called. And there's only four of those. Okay now in this example, their offerings are technically like this. It's like they have. Only the top of the pyramid. But the top of the pyramid is technically divided into... Three layers, okay? They have that grand suite. They have the regular suite and then they have like the base level rooms. Okay. They don't offer anything below $2,000 a night. Okay. And then again, the grand suites are like $3,500 to like $5,000 a night. OK, now that's there's no difference there in, you know, done for you, done with you, done on your own. They don't sell merch. You know, it's like literally the rest of their entire attention that they get. That's all it is. Like that's all it's left to be is just attention. The only way that this place makes money is when you book a room for one of their suites or one of their base level, like that's it. That's the only time they make money. That's all, right? And it's like, now this place, listen to this. I'm not sure how this works, like the Michelin guide thing that ranks food. They also rank hotels now and they call it Michelin Keys. And. The same kind of system, like one star, is like you know, good. Two stars is great. Three stars is like world-renowned. And there's the fewest three stars that exist. The point I'm trying to make is, is in this particular case, like this one got the three stars, right? It's like, well, what else could they really sell? I suppose they could add, if they wanted to, maybe some merch or something. You know? But like, I really can't sell anything else. You understand? So in their example, like that's just what their business makes sense to do. Okay, but in your business, is like, does it make sense to have this type of model? Like, probably not. You know, like one of my favorite examples from the group that had this type of model for the longest time was Jeremy Moser. So Jeremy Moser has been with us for several years now. And he has only had the done for you offer. This entire time. And. I remember, I think it was a good like two years ago. After he cracked like 300k a month. I told Jeremy, I was like, dude, I think you're losing like so much money not having your own version of like, at the very least, like don't do an inner circle. Just do like consulting. You know, and teach your system. And he has a business partner. His business partner names Jan and Jan's here in the group. Jan's solid. Jan didn't want to do consulting. He was like, no, dude, I think that's really going to cannibalize our done for you offer. And so what I told him to do instead. was a licensing office. Which is essentially still consulting, but I told him to charge. 50K for six months or 100K for a year? Plus a rev share. And that made Jan very happy. And that made Jeremy very happy. Okay. And that's going to add a lot of revenue to what they currently do. And historically, to be clear, they've only had that done for you component. Now, if Jeremy chose to have a course that teaches what Jeremy does, it's like that really wouldn't make that much sense for them because that would cannibalize the, it would create competitors. It would create competitors. That would cannibalize their holy grail up here at the top. They're done for you. With a licensing offer, it's high ticket enough to where obviously no poor person is going to be able to afford it. Only people who are very financially qualified—those they get to vet and those they get to control the system of—will be able to have buy that offer. That does not cannibalize their 'done for you,' if anything. It makes it so they're just going to capture a fuckload more revenue and control who gets to use their systems. And they have a very unique system. They're very good. I talk very highly of Jeremy Moser and his team all the time. They do awesome. Now, let me be clear when I say this. In my world, okay, I can teach you guys every single thing that I do, and in no way shape or form does it cannibalize my done for you offer as a matter of fact, sometimes it's the exact opposite. Sometimes you guys, who are very financially qualified, do a lot of these things, and you're like, you know, Jeremy, honestly, I think it just kind of makes sense to just have you come in and just do all this shit. And that's not my intention, to be clear. My intention is to give you literally everything that I need you to do, and for you to obviously do it, make a fuckload of money with it. Sometimes you want to ascend as a result of the amount of stuff that you realize you need to do. Sometimes it just makes sense for you to do a consulting deal. Where you're like, 'Jeremy,' I just hired a lot more people. I'm in a much better financial position than I was when I first joined into this thing. I'd like to have more involvement from you. And I want you to hold my people accountable and just, you know, kind of be like my outsourced CMO. And again, like if we have the room, like we'll happily accommodate that. But that's my point— is, like, I can teach. And for years, you know, since 2017, I had my agency course where I would teach people how to start and scale agencies. It's like. Dude, the number one niche— the number one niche that almost every single new agency owner wants to go into— is information, okay? And for the longest time, especially... Way back then, you know, we were really only in info. Nowadays, we're very spread out across many different niches. Really, just anything high-ticket product or service-oriented, but still, about 50 percent of our client base is still in info. Today, it's like—I don't give a fuck if I— if I have a thousand people in a month that want to try to compete with me in info. My rap sheet of successful deals is far too long, and also continues to grow. I'd have to go into a coma for a decade for anybody to have a chance to catch up to me inside of that niche. I outspend everybody that could ever attempt to compete with me inside of that space. So I can literally teach to the T exactly what I do to get deals, exactly what we do to have success in deals, exactly what we do for marketing in those deals. And again, it doesn't do anything to harm our done for you. Because again, we have a moat in that example. So to answer your question very directly, Torrin, it's very important to understand this. The point I'm attempting to make is, is like in that example, with a very thorough and easy understanding, we're not going to sabotage shit. By having these other offers. Right. We're just going to capture more revenue that we otherwise would not have captured. In Jeremy Moser's example, it's like, well, yeah, I mean, dude, if Jeremy Moser had a course like that, absolutely could sabotage his done for you in comparison. So it makes sense. Right. It's like the hotel brand that we just talked about. It's like. It doesn't even really make sense for them to somehow be able to work in another offer. Like, what are they going to do? You know, what else could they sell? You know what I mean? That's how you think about, like, if it makes sense to do the stack of do-it-yourself done with you or done for you. I think that's where it makes the most sense. One final example, okay? Here in Miami Beach, okay? When you go to the beach, there are public parking lots. where you can struggle to find a place to park. carry all your shit from your car to the beach, like your towels and maybe you brought an umbrella and maybe even brought your kids and and a fucking set of toys for them and you brought sunscreens and waters and food— I mean, that's the do-it-yourself version of going to the beach, right? It's the cheapest version. It's the cheapest way to do it. It's the most, it's the least involved from anybody else that could help you, you know, but it's the most work on your part. And I mean, that fucking sucks, you know, but that's honestly how the most people go to the beach, right? It's like back to the pyramid. That's where the most people are. Okay. However, Let me tell you how I go to the beach. OK, I pay 10K a year to be a member at the one hotel. And I also pay 6K a year to be a member at the Soho house. All right. Now, long story short. When I go to the beach, I pull up in one of my fancy cars at the valet. I immediately give the guy a hundred bucks to park it out front. I pop out. Okay. I grab a water from the anatomy gym that's in between me and the beach. I then get to the beach. I check in by giving them my little membership card and I say, 'Hey, I want a cabana.' The cabana is then set up for me by two different dudes who lay out the towels, set up umbrellas, shade the thing. give them two extra beach chairs in front of the cabana that are intended to lay out on for the sunshine. I get a waitress that immediately comes up. Hello, Mr. Haynes. Hello, Miss Haynes. What would you like today? And they'll bring me fucking food from one of the restaurants at the one hotel if I want, or at the very least some waters, you know? And yeah, I mean, whatever your couple hundred bucks in 10K a year, it's like I'll go to the beach like that any day of the fucking week compared to going like the plebs do. Fuck that. You know, I'll happily expense that cost. So like even the beach. Right. And there's obviously middle tiers to that. where you can go to the same one hotel. You don't have to be a member, right? You just show up. I get a discounted rate on the cabana, right? They're going to charge you 500 bucks. They charge me a buck 25 and I get like 30. Percent off everything that I buy. So when I go frequently enough, I actually pay for that ten thousand dollars easily for the year. Plus I get all the other cool benefits of being a member. Now I digress. You could go to the one hotel too. You could walk through the hotel. You could get to the back with a little bit of friction and maybe having to grease some people along the way to get back there. And by the time you go check in, they're either going to charge you 500 bucks for the same cabana or they're just going to give you the standard two beach chairs. The waitresses aren't really going to give a fuck about you because you're probably not wearing your $175,000 Richard Milk. And they're just going to say, 'Hey, you know what's going on?' They might get to you when they get to you. You know, you're one of maybe 70 other people that are there at the beach in the regular chairs. That'd be like the middle tier way to go to the beach. You understand? Even going to the beach has three different tiers. Of how you can do it. You understand? It's like, really think about that. It's like, so again, I think this makes the most sense. If you went to the beach and you only had cabanas, right? And the only other way you could go to the beach was just lugging all your shit there yourself and parking in one of the public parking lots. I don't think that would make that much sense in comparison. Right. Why wouldn't you have the other two tiers? You see what I mean? Anyway. I think that puts it in perspective. Okay, Chris Reddick says, 'I was struggling to think about a do-it-yourself and a done-with-you offer for my business and was able to use ChatGPT to come up with some awesome options to use. If anyone has a mental block, I strongly recommend giving it a go. Awesome choice, Chris. Also, be advised, Jeremy AI is also very good at helping you come up with these things if you need some stuff. I just thought about that. I was like, 'Ah, yeah, thank you.' Appreciate it. All good. No, ChatGPT still fucks super hard. Big fan. Okay, cool. All right, any other questions on this? Feel free to unmute yourself and ask away if you do, or just drop a question in the chat. Let's wrap this up. All right, very good. And then. Let's see, Pascal, you still here? Pascal, hello. Are you there? Going once? All right, cool. All good. All right. Hope this was helpful to everybody. Enjoy your days. Talk soon. Hit me up if you have any questions. And remember, we're less than a month out from our Q3 Mastermind, July 12th and 13th. Just shoot me a DM on Telegram if you intend on coming. RSVP with me, please. And yeah, just let me know you're on your way. That way I can gauge the amount of food that we need and all that fun stuff. Thank you, Simone. All right, cool. Talk to you, everybody. Bye. Thanks, Jeremy.
