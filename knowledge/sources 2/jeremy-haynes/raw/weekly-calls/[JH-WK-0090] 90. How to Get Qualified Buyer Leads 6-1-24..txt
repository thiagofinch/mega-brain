Transcrição Completa: 90 How to Get Qualified Buyer Leads 6 1 24
[00:00] Real quick. So, what we're going to do today, we're going to talk about how to find and attract some financially qualified buyer leads.
[00:08] This came up in the group chat this week, so I figured it'd be a good opportunity to talk about it. I don't think we've talked about this either in a long time or maybe ever.
[00:18] So, for starters, what I'm specifically talking about is you sell some type of product or service, and it could be advertising on behalf of a client, it could be your own things.
[00:28] A lot of the times when you're marketing other people's stuff, it's very easy to see some of these lessons. But when you advertise your own products and services, you can kind of get lost in the weeds and you kind of forget how simple it is to attract turds into your funnel and into your pipelines.
[00:45] Um, I would love if there's somebody on the call, if you guys have either a link to a client or a link to your own stuff where you are either struggling to attract financially qualified buyer leads, we can look through it together.
[00:58] Even if you get like half of your leads that come through turdish, uh feel free to throw that link into the chat and we can kind of audit it together in real time so we can see some uh some real-time principles.
[01:12] Um I personally don't have any examples because I do a fantastic job of financially qualifying people prior to coming into the funnels that we have on behalf of ourselves and our clients. So we get very little turds to come through.
[01:25] But if somebody's struggling with the issue, I'd be happy to go through it in real time with one of your guys' offers if you want to throw it into the chat. Uh we can go through it together.
[01:35] Uh, okay cool. So, let's get started with just some of the principles behind what we got to do to attract financially qualified buyer leads.

[01:45] So, number one, and this is one of the most important things, financially qualified buyer leads are important to understand. First of all, what the fuck does that even mean?
[01:55] For me, it's simple. We want to do our lead gen in a way that brings in people who are at a very high probability qualified to buy our main thing that's high ticket and expensive.
[02:08] So, it's important to note one thing that typically happens when you do lead gen is you try to give things away. You know, you try to put yourself in a position where you provide value to people upfront.
[02:20] And of course, to be clear, there's nothing wrong with that. I'd encourage value. Rod, you drawing lines on my chart, dude? I was trying to pull it instead of growing.
[02:30] Okay, cool. All right. Well, anyway, long story short, one thing that we want to make sure that we understand right away is it's okay to provide value and give things away for free. Nothing wrong with that. I want to make it very clear right off the bat. This is not a bad thing to do.
[02:48] In the instance that you are currently trying to attract financially qualified buyer leads and you're currently giving something away for free. However, there are little nuances of this that can really fuck you in the instance that you do this part wrong. Okay?
[03:05] Just because I'm giving something away for free doesn't mean that I have to speak to people who are financially unqualified for the main thing I'm actually trying to sell them afterwards.

VISUAL: Exemplo de negócio de alto ticket, construtor de quintais de luxo para proprietários ricos
[03:18] Let's just give some examples of some random businesses that exist out there and how they could attract a more financially qualified individual by doing something for free.
[03:27] So, I'll give you a perfect example. I saw a guy yesterday on Instagram. He was advertising to build multi-hundred thousand dollar backyards for rich homeowners. Okay?
[03:38] And he did a fantastic job at this. All of his content was essentially the same. It was a repetitive, hey, this is a backyard that this homeowner spent $70,000 on creating.
[03:50] They wanted us to show them a render of what it looked like first. Here's what we rendered for him. And then it's like a little music that starts to play with just a digital render of what their backyard could have looked like.
[04:02] And then he like snaps his fingers and he goes, "And here's what we did." And then it's like just a render in real life and him walking around the backyard just hard flexing a little oasis.
[04:13] And he does these videos with homeowners that are spending like $500,000 plus. And I went through about three dozen of this guy's videos.
[04:22] And what I noticed is the guy never ever ever says anything less than $50,000 for his total cost of these average backyards. Okay.
[04:32] So, right away as a group of marketers, what can we understand about what this guy wants for his average client? Somebody unmute yourself and say what the guy wants minimum out of somebody who's going to work with him?
[04:45] AUDIENCE: 50k.
[04:47] That's right. His average homeowner that he wants to work with in terms of project size, his minimum standard is $50,000.
[04:56] Doesn't seem like he had a cap. The most expensive one, at least in the three dozen pieces of content that I watched, was about 500k and everywhere in between.
[05:05] Seems like most of them were between like 75 and maybe 175 to be fair, but there were some outliers.
[05:12] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Lead Magnet Strategy: Free Digital Render"
NÚMEROS: 15 questions, $50,000 minimum budget, 5-8 photos required
VISUAL: Funil de aplicação com múltiplas perguntas qualificadoras, processo de render digital gratuito
[05:14] Now, point being, this guy had a lead magnet for a link in his bio, okay? And his lead magnet was literally this. It was an application funnel to get one of these digital renders for free. It's all it was. Okay.
[05:28] So, his opportunity to generate a free lead magnet for somebody and provide them some value of showing them what their backyard could look like was having him go through it was about a 15 question application funnel and it was very simple.
[05:42] It's just a link to an application. It had a bunch of questions. Um, can you guys guess? I hope it's obvious what the number one qualifying question likely is. Somebody say it out loud.
[05:53] AUDIENCE: Either, you know, either a budget based question or how much is the value of your home.
[05:58] So the question was, what's your budget? And he had a multiple choice questionnaire and the number one answer for that questionnaire for multiple choice answer number one was $50,000 or less.
[06:12] And then like brackets of like 50,000 to 75,000, 75,000 to 100,000, 100,000 to 200,000 all the way up to like a million plus.
[06:22] And can you guess what the qualifying question was that would disqualify one of those leads from not getting a digital render? 50k or less.
[06:30] AUDIENCE: That's right.
[06:32] One of those fucks had $50,000 or less who's not getting a digital render. Okay.
[06:38] So, long story short, uh, is it wrong for the guy to advertise a lead magnet for free to help generate a digital render of somebody's property and not do it in the instance that somebody has $50,000 or less for their project?
[06:52] Does anybody have an ethical disagreement about denying that type of person the opportunity to even get the digital render?
[07:00] I got a simple question for you. When you do your lead magnets, do you just give it away to everybody or do you try to qualify the people who are actually good qualified leads?
[07:10] So, this guy, keep in mind, there's a little bit of work to this lead magnet. To be fair, most of us when we provide lead magnets, we're willing to give it away to anybody because it's some type of thing that we can just email over to the person or autonomously give them access to. There's no real work involved.
[07:27] So, I'm sure that this guy has a very efficient process on the back end to generate these digital renders for people's backyards.
[07:35] He has the homeowners upload photos of the backyard. Even more ideal if they have a drone shot of the backyard, he specified, but it's totally cool if you just go in your backyard and take a take a few photos from each corner of the yard.
[07:48] Um, he says if you have a two-story home, try to go out in one of the windows and take like more of an aerial shot of it. And he asks you to upload at least five to eight photos of the backyard.
[08:00] So, obviously, for this guy's case, for his lead magnet, they have to go through the five to eight photos. They have to essentially like somehow and I don't know how map what the backyard looks like in terms of its shape and size.
[08:13] And then obviously they have to digitally render in what the backyard could look like based on some of these descriptions in the questionnaire that people answer in the application itself.
[08:23] So the application had a bunch of questions. Like I said the qualifying question seemed to be if you had a $50,000 budget or less get fucked.
[08:32] If you had anything more than that, that would kind of add or remove some of the things that they would do. The $500,000 backyard was fucking insane.
[08:42] Literally looked like a resort versus the $50,000 backyard, it's like a pool, you know, some concrete features, maybe some flowers and like some chairs.
[08:52] Um, $200,000 backyards had like fucking fountains shooting into the pool, lights, you know, like little cabana sections, fucking outdoor kitchens, you know, like all kinds of extra shit.
[09:05] So, the budget is also important to note for this guy as a value add because that's going to determine like what he literally adds to the digital render that's like within the person's budget and still makes him profitable on the deal.
[09:18] The size of the backyard. They ask for the address and they also have you check this little box that asks permission to essentially map the square footage of the backyard. That way they can be extremely accurate with the digital render.

NÚMEROS: Não especificado
VISUAL: Princípio central destacado - não é necessário dar lead magnet para todos, apenas para qualificados
[09:34] So anyway, moral of the story, this was a really simple lesson, which is this guy's giving something away for free, but he's not giving it away for free to everybody.
[09:44] He's giving it away for free to the people who are financially qualified to buy his actual offer. Okay?
[09:50] And this is point number one that I want to make. And this is very simple to understand. Do we have to give our lead magnet away to everybody? No. No.
[10:00] You know, no we don't. No the fuck we don't. We can we can just give it away to people who are actually financially qualified for it.
[10:08] So ideally we are qualifying our leads that come in and providing the value to the ones that are qualified. So we have to have a way to be able to differentiate our leads. Okay.
[10:19] So even if we do give it away for everybody and even if we don't have a 15-step application questionnaire, well why couldn't we ask maybe just one question that qualifies people? That makes sense, right?
[10:32] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Example: Hydrate Funnel - 10 Free Things"
NÚMEROS: 10 free items, 1 qualifying question
VISUAL: Exemplo pessoal do apresentador, funil de hidratação para donos de agência/marketers
[10:34] Give you an example. I have a hydrate funnel running that provides 10 free things to agency owners or marketers.
[10:42] And I just ask a very simple qualifying question. Are you an agency owner, a digital marketer, a business owner, or neither? That's it.
[10:52] Other than that, we collect name, email, phone number, and then we just give them access to the 10 different things.
[11:00] The 10 different things are all things to be clear I'll talk about here momentarily in terms of attracting good quality leads in the first place.
[11:08] But the main thing I want to emphasize here is it's just a single question that I use for my qualifier.
[11:14] Well, what's that give me the ability to do? First of all, if somebody's an agency owner, I can talk to them in a very specific way.
[11:22] If somebody's just a digital marketer and that's all they identify themselves as, I can talk to them in a very specific way and I have solutions for those two different types of people.
[11:32] I can create marketing automation and follow up and provide additional value to those people just based on the fact they're one of those two things.
[11:41] If they're a business owner, well, I'm not going to talk to them like an agency owner. You know, I'm not going to sell them on starting a marketing agency.
[11:49] If they're a business owner, I'm I'm not really going to talk to them like they're the digital marketer. I'll give them the opportunity through the marketing automation to identify as learning themselves or wanting to train their staff.
[12:02] And I'll same thing, I'll talk to them contextually. Now, if they say none of the above, I'll still give them access to the 10 things, but I put them into a completely different segmented marketing automation list.
[12:15] I don't try to talk to those people the same. I don't try to sell those people as much. I don't have my sales team waste their time on talking to those specific individuals.
[12:25] We specifically focus and put our attention on the ones that are qualified for us and that we deem just based on that one question worth talking to. Okay.
[12:35] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Key Principle #2: What You Give Away Matters"
NÚMEROS: Não especificado
VISUAL: Segundo princípio destacado - o tipo de conteúdo gratuito atrai diferentes tipos de leads
[12:37] Now to be clear, this is the next little segue and I'll use my Hydra as an example of this. Okay, it's important to note that when we are giving things away, what we give away for our leads also has a lot to do with who we attract.
[12:52] So what we choose to give away attracts different types of leads.
[12:57] So, for me, as an example, here's an ideal customer who likely has money as an agency owner, a digital marketer. It's somebody who's already in the game.
[13:08] You know, the existing agency owner, well, they likely already have some kind of traction in comparison to the person who's trying to like quit a job.
[13:17] You know, the person who has a few clients likely has more money than the guy who's sitting there in a job that wants to become an agency owner instead.
[13:26] The digital marketer who is already doing marketing even if they work a job you know I can get their boss to pay for it for the training that we want to offer that individual.
[13:36] That's okay too but to be clear the things that I give away so remember I mentioned I give away 10 different things in my hydro funnel those 10 things that I give away are all very specific things.
[13:50] Excuse me those 10 things are all very specific to people who have high-level problems.

VISUAL: Comparação entre problemas de pessoas qualificadas financeiramente vs iniciantes
[14:00] The pro the the 10 things. Keep in mind when I'm saying it, the 10 things that I give away in my hydro funnel all deal with things that a financially qualified individual would deal with.
[14:12] Not a noob or somebody who is just getting started. They are things that somebody already down the line, already in the game, has a high probability to already be making money in the game are dealing with and struggling with.
[14:26] Not any kind of beginner-based issues. Does that make sense? Why? Somebody unmute yourselves and explain why that makes sense. Why? Tell me why I'm doing that.
[14:38] AUDIENCE: Because that's what they need help with.
[14:40] That's right. The financially qualified people, they have a different set of problems in comparison to the noobs, right?
[14:48] So the people that are already doing it who have a high probability to be making the money once again they have a different set of problems that I can help with.
[14:57] The beginners they have a different set of problems that to be fair I could deal with but once again they have a lower probability to become financially qualified and actually afford what we're trying to sell them for our main thing.
[15:10] So although we could attract them as leads and help them, well, why would we want to?
[15:16] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Key Principle #3: Messaging Influences Who You Attract"
NÚMEROS: Não especificado
VISUAL: Terceiro princípio - verbiage em ads, funnels e automação influencia exponencialmente o tipo de lead
[15:18] You see, the verbiage that we use inside of our advertising messaging, inside of our funnel messaging, who we specifically choose to talk to obviously influences exponentially the type of person that we're going to attract through that funnel in the first place, the type of person we're going to attract through those ads.
[15:37] So, what we say inside of our ads and our funnels and our marketing automation follow-up, it's all influence to a very strong degree. Who's probable to come through it in the first place?
[15:48] So, understand this. When we sell things that cost several thousand dollars or let's say tens of thousands of dollars, you know, some of you as an example, you guys are agency owners and you guys try to advertise for agency services.
[16:03] And then you, you know, kind of complain and bitch when you get a low-quality lead coming through your funnel and you're like, well, I don't know why I'm getting a bunch of low-quality people coming through.
[16:14] It's like you're gonna set no expectations. Whenever we are about to pitch somebody, you know what we say inside of our video pitches?

[16:25] We literally demonstrate to people. We're like, "Yeah, so our average client typically spends about $30,000 to $50,000 over the first 30 days.
[16:35] Let me give you some examples of what people who have spent that amount with us have turned that money into over a 60 to 90-day timeline.
[16:44] You know, just that alone, that one little thing that I'm saying there sets the tone immediately that you have to have at least $30 to $50,000 to take advantage of what I'm about to talk about.
[16:56] It's a disqualifier and a qualifier in one.

NÚMEROS: $25,000/month mark, $10K/month, few thousand dollars
VISUAL: Exemplos de qualificadores situacionais para vendedores Amazon em diferentes níveis
[17:02] If I, as an example, have a very specific type of person that I'm going after where I want them to have I'll use Andrew as an example.
[17:11] Let's say that I want and Andrew likes working with people who are making less money than him so he can help them get to his level of income with an Amazon store, you know, but he doesn't want brokies coming through his funnel.
[17:24] But he also doesn't want ballers that are doing like eight figures on Amazon already. He doesn't think he can help that type of person.
[17:31] So, as an example, it's like he can specify, hey, if you're already selling on Amazon and you can't break the $25,000 a month mark, let me show you some specific things you could do to break through that ceiling.
[17:45] You know, hey, if you're just getting started on Amazon and you can't seem to crack 10K a month, but you're making a few thousand dollars already, let me show you what you can do to crack through that ceiling.
[17:57] Hey, if you're selling on Amazon and you're stuck with a bunch of inventory right now that's been aging and you're starting to get charged aged inventory fees, let me show you some search tips that will help increase the rank of your product and sell through more of that inventory just sitting there.
[18:14] Now, why do I use that one? I didn't use a number, right? I didn't say a financially qualified number.
[18:21] Well, somebody who's investing in inventory probably is spending a few thousand dollars already and probably making a few thousand dollars already.
[18:30] I want to pick situations in addition to the obvious things. I the obvious things to be clear to me are the numbers.

[18:40] I can just literally say, "Hey, if you're working with like this kind of income," or, "Hey, you're working with this kind of money."
[18:47] Or like I have a uh I have a client right now takes about $45,000 to get started with them for their offer.
[18:55] And I have them say in almost every ad, I say, "Hey, if you got $50,000 just burning a hole in your pocket and you're looking for a semi-risky investment that can pay you a lot more than the stock market or real estate or fucking crypto with a higher probability of return. Let me show you what I can do for you.
[19:15] You know, I want to I want to make sure you guys understand the obvious ones are typically just the financial qualifiers.
[19:22] The non-obvious ones are the situations and circumstances that financially qualified people find themselves in. There's a huge difference there.
[19:32] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Nick's E-commerce Example"
NÚMEROS: $10K/month (não quer), $200K+/month (ideal), 6-7 figures/month
VISUAL: Exemplo de agência e-commerce que trabalha com lojas fazendo centenas de milhares por mês
[19:34] So Nick in his situation, he doesn't want to work with an e-commerce store that's doing like 10K a month. That'd probably be somebody for his e for his education company products, you know, if that maybe, you know.
[19:47] Ideally when Nick's agency is going to work with somebody, he's working with people that are already doing likely a couple hundred grand a month at this point, you know.
[19:56] And to be clear, when Nick attracts clients, I'm sure he gets some turds that come through, but at the same time, I'm sure he gets some great people that come through.
[20:05] He'll get more great people the more great situational pieces of content he puts out there in the world for showing and demonstrating that he solves the problems of people already doing a couple hundred K a month as an e-commerce store.
[20:19] And at the same time, that process of him putting out that type of content increases his expertise. It demonstrates his skills as an e-commerce advertiser and agency owner.
[20:30] And it also at the same time will attract the education company clients that he's looking for who are financially unqualified anyway, but it gets more of the financially qualified folks at the same time.
[20:42] So Nick constantly puts out content about essentially breakthrough advertising lessons. He's constantly putting out content about, you know, potential hooks that people can use or why some ads worked or what you should say inside of ads or reviewing ads.
[20:58] It's a lot of Nick's content on a consistent basis. Now, what if he just added one little thing to that where he said, "This business was stuck at mid-6 figures a month and here was the hook they were using.
[21:11] Here was the hook we started using to have them crack seven figures a month." It'd be the same type of content, right?
[21:18] But he would just add that one little caveat to it, which is we're working with people who are doing six figures a month and we help take them to seven figures a month.
[21:28] How many more people would see Nick's content that are making six figures a month and say, "Oh shit this might be my guy I've been looking for."
[21:37] It's just one little caveat on top of what he's already saying. And if he did that, let's say, 25% more often than he does now, so one out of every four pieces of content he added that to.
[21:49] That'd be 100% more than what it seems like he's doing now. And that would likely increase a lot of additional qualified lead flow coming in just from that one little thing that he adds on top of there, the qualifier.
[22:03] And keep in mind, there's specific problems that people doing in mid-range six figures are struggling with in comparison to what people doing seven figures are dealing with or in comparison to what people doing five figures or in comparison to people doing nothing yet are dealing with.
[22:20] Right, Nick, unmute yourself and tell me what somebody doing 300 to 500K a month is struggling with. Tell me their specific problem.
[22:30] NICK: Seven figures a month. Um, their specific problem though is one, their creative team sucks.
[22:38] Uh some some of them even still running Facebook ads themselves and they have no direction or strategy of what they need to deploy in their Facebook ad account to be able to break that barrier.
[22:50] Um that usually comes down to the content side of just creating better ads and also expansion to other countries and things like that.

VISUAL: Lista de problemas específicos: advertiser não confiável, incapacidade de escalar, falta de estratégia
[23:00] Let me give you an example that a client I just talked to a client the other day or I should say a potential client big brand they already do seven figures a month organically.
[23:11] They have an advertiser who actually used to be in the inner circle and this guy can't get them past two to 300k a month on paid advertising.
[23:20] That specific guy has also never taken anybody to seven figures a month via paid advertising.
[23:27] Do you know what that brand talked to me for? They said, "Hey man, we got an advertiser right now." You You actually used to coach the guy. He's one of your students.
[23:37] And I don't know, we're just kind of losing confidence in him. It's been like a year now and we've just kind of been stuck at two to 300K a month.
[23:46] We don't know really what the guy's doing wrong. We just think we got the wrong guy.
[23:51] That's a specific problem that I come across a lot for people that are stuck at like 2 to 500K a month with whatever advertiser they've got. They don't feel confident in the person.
[24:02] Sometimes they have a funnel that like what Andrew was talking about before we started recording here today. He said, "Well, I mean, every time I try to scale it, dude, I just my cost per result just goes up. I just can't seem to maintain whatever it is. So, my ROAS starts to drop."
[24:18] Sometimes it's a strategy like that. Like they just say something like, "Dude, I can't spend more than 100k a month. Every time I try, my fucking just my ROAS drops." You know?
[24:29] I don't know if I've got the right strategy. I I don't know if I'm on the right channels. Like, I don't know really know what's going on. But every time I try to spend more than 100k, it just stops.
[24:40] That's a very specific problem of somebody doing a couple hundred K a month, right? Person just getting started or the person doing five figures, they're not struggling with that. The person doing a couple hundred grand a month struggling with that.

[24:55] So, as an example, once again, when I'm attracting any kind of lead, I want to make sure I I call out the fact that we can not only use and leverage just financial situations.
[25:06] We can call out the situations that somebody's in, just those circumstances that they're dealing with. And we can use all of them.
[25:14] So, I'll give you an example, right? If I'm making an ad and I'm I want to do like a business manager audit where I give them like a consulting session on what potential strategies they can implement to scale to seven figures a month.
[25:29] My ad would be something like this. I'd say, "Listen, if you're a business owner that every time you try to spend more than a couple hundred K a month, your ads just start to take a dump. You can't seem to scale. Your cost per result just goes out of whack. Your ROAS drops every time.
[25:46] Maybe you got an advertiser that's just never scaled a business to seven figures a month. Could be an in-house guy. Maybe an agency.
[25:54] We've scaled 36 people to seven figures a month. Maybe you're in a situation where you don't feel confident about your current strategy that you're running.
[26:03] You know, you see the limitations and you you see the ceiling really clear and maybe you're running into that ceiling here and there.
[26:10] I want to give you an opportunity to have us come in and just audit what you're doing. As an agency that's taken 36 different businesses to seven figures a month, hundreds to mid-range six figures.
[26:22] We have dozens of strategies that we've originated and I'd be happy to go through those strategies with you, make sure you understand them.
[26:30] You'll walk away from the call being able to implement them if you have the staff or capabilities to do it or you'll walk away from that call having confidence that we might be the team that can help you do it.
[26:42] Next, book your consultation below. Press the button.
[26:46] You know, it's like in that case, I might get a lot of people that want to get to those levels, but keep in mind, I'm by situations that I'm calling out attracting more of the right person.
[26:58] And then through my application, I am deterring the wrong people who answer with lower qualification answers than what I'd otherwise want to see coming through onto my calendar.
[27:10] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Critical Understanding: You Will Still Get Turds"
NÚMEROS: Não especificado
VISUAL: Aviso importante - turds aspiracionais sempre virão, mas são desqualificados no funil
[27:12] So, to be clear, one caveat to this whole thing I want to make very, very, very evident to you, okay? This is one of the most important parts about financially qualified buyer leads coming in that you have to deal with.
[27:25] You will still get turds that aspire to be great. You disqualify them through the funnel. You'll attract them through the ads, but you will disqualify them through the funnel process.
[27:36] This is very important understanding. Anytime we talk at a high level, there'll be a lot of people out there who want to aspire to greatness and achieve that same level, but they're broke and unqualified.
[27:48] Well, it's okay. I mean, they're going to come through your ads, but that doesn't mean they have to go through the funnel itself.
[27:55] That doesn't mean your sales team has to talk to them. That doesn't mean that they have to go through the same automation that you're going to send off to the people who are qualified.
[28:04] But remember qualifying questions that qualify the right people and disqualify the wrong people. We have to have that differentiator. Okay?
[28:13] Otherwise, once again, that's when you actually see the turds coming through the funnel. This is a very important thing to understand.
[28:20] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Ideal Lead Qualification Ratio"
NÚMEROS: 90% unqualified vs 10% qualified (BAD), 60-80% qualified vs 20-40% unqualified (GOOD)
VISUAL: Comparação de ratios ruins vs bons, métricas de qualificação de leads
[28:22] If you're getting all turds, okay, getting a bunch of brokies coming through your funnel, getting everybody that you think is a lead, like let's say get 90% of people that are unqualified and 10% that are qualified. This is a terrible ratio.
[28:37] If you're doing it right, you should see upwards of at least 60 to 80% of your total leads coming through qualified and about 20 to 40% coming through unqualified.
[28:48] That's the ratio where you are saying the right things in your ads, you're saying the right things in your funnel, you have disqualifying questions that push the turds into their own segmented automation.
[29:00] It's the main thing you got to understand. If you're doing it right and you're saying the right things, you'll get a higher ratio.
[29:07] If you're saying the wrong things just means you got a messaging issue. To be fair, sometimes it can be a targeting issue, but targeting in itself, especially nowadays with all the broad targeting that's being leveraged, doesn't have as much influence in comparison to what it historically has.
[29:24] A lot of what's attracting the bad people, comes down to just what you're saying in those ad videos, what you're saying inside of the ad copy, and what you're saying inside of your funnels.
[29:35] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Understanding Your Target's Problems"
NÚMEROS: $100 million/year (Matt Monero example)
VISUAL: Importância de entender profundamente os problemas específicos do público-alvo qualificado
[29:37] Now, I want to be rather direct and say as I've become richer myself, I've done a tremendously better job at communicating to other rich people. It's just something that's naturally happened through time.
[29:50] However, it's very important to note that doesn't mean you can't educate and emulate what a rich person's thinking, but you have to be able to truly understand their specific problems.
[30:02] Your qualified leads, the people that you actually want to sell to, you got to constantly be thinking like what they are thinking.
[30:10] One of my mentors, his name is Matt Monero. Matt Monero, he wrote this book called You Need More Money. It's a great book. Matt makes $100 million a year. He finances semi-trucks here in the United States out of Texas.
[30:25] And Matt as a mentor, one thing that's really interesting that he does, so here in the United States, we have what's called a W2 or a tax return depending on obviously your tax situation.
[30:36] But what Matt will do is he'll say, "Hey, just show me your tax return for the last year. I want to flash back to when I was in your shoes and what I was specifically dealing with in that time frame."
[30:49] And then based on where you're at financially, without being able to lie about it, just literally based on what your tax return says, he takes himself from where he's at today at 100 plus million dollars, which is for the most part very unrelatable to a majority of business people on Earth.
[31:07] And he flashes back mentally to where you are at currently in your financial situation.
[31:13] And he tries to talk to you based on that specific level of problems that you're dealing with of potential motivators that you're dealing with.
[31:21] That's the main thing that he does that's hyper-valuable. He just talks to you based on where you're at. You can't lose touch.
[31:29] You have to be tapped in to what your potential financially qualified buyer leads are actually thinking. They're actually struggling with what they actually want.
[31:39] Sure, most of the time as marketers, we just make it up, you know, and there's nothing wrong with that, but I want to be clear in saying we can't undermine this specific step of the process when it comes to ideation.
[31:52] When it comes to what we should say inside of our ads, when it comes to what we should say inside of our funnels.
[31:58] So, we have to be able to create a very clear process that we go through when we are coming up with what we are going to say inside of our ads, what we're going to say inside of our funnels. That's the real stuff, you know.

[32:13] So, one of my favorite things to do, and this is very important to understand, I like to actually look at the qualified leads of the business we're working with. And when I say look, this is a very interesting process that I don't see a lot of other people talking about that I do high.
[32:29] I do this frequently so I don't lose touch. Okay, I go to the person's Instagram. I go to the person's Facebook. Okay, so what I'll do if let's say I'm working with a client, okay?
[32:40] And a client will typically already have people that they're closing that once again like they've already got revenue from and they know that these people are qualified, okay?
[32:49] So, first of all, do a few things. We'll literally get that list and then we'll look those people up on social media.
[32:56] And what we'll do, and you can find a lot out about a person, especially if they're active on social media, we'll look as an example of what specific things they're actually spending time doing.

[33:09] Like, as an example, if I go to my ideal client, like I look at all of you guys as an example, let's use the inner circle to be clear.
[33:17] I follow every single one of you guys on Instagram. And I love following you guys on Instagram because you all have a lot of similarities.
[33:25] You know, you guys, it's like my way of being able to keep up with you guys. It's an opportunity for me to sometimes drop in and help you when you're specifically doing something or an opportunity to encourage you to do something.
[33:37] You know, if I see you're doing the right things. And to be clear, it also keeps me tapped into like what you guys actually go out and do.
[33:45] You know, almost every single one of you have a very consistent workout regimen that you actively flex on your social media all the time.
[33:53] For some of you, it's boxing. For some of you, it's running. For some of you, it's just going to the fucking gym.
[34:00] Almost every single one of you, every other day is posting about something along the lines of like, you know, I'm just being active. Or sometimes it's even just going on a walk.
[34:10] You know, a lot of you guys, almost all of us, I think, value food. I think every single one of you guys hard flex restaurants, you know, just like I do.
[34:20] You know, you like you guys like high quality food. You know, I don't know if you guys are tapping into Michelin restaurants yet, but wherever the fuck you live, you're going to the nicest restaurants for sure.
[34:31] You know why I pick the food that I do for the masterminds when it comes to just a fuckload of meat and a little bit of carbs on the side for those who want it?
[34:40] Why do we do the Brazilian steakhouse twice a day? Because that's all you guys fucking post. I mean, damn near all of you seem like you're carnivores, you know?
[34:50] Just post steaks every time that you go out, you know? I've never seen one of you guys I don't think post a fish. You know, you guys all just post steaks.
[35:00] You know, it's like to be clear from literally just following you guys. I know that you guys love steak. You know what I mean?
[35:08] So, it's obvious for what I need to do with the masterminds. I need to provide you guys with steak and not just any steak. I need I need to post I need to make sure you guys have steaks that are actually good.
[35:20] So, I picked one of the best Brazilian steakhouses around here to to deliver for you guys. Okay.
[35:27] Now, to be clear, the other things that you guys seem to value are the relationships you have. You know, most of you guys have some kind of partner.
[35:35] There's a few of you guys that are single to be fair, but most of you guys, I mean, even the guys that are single, you know, like you're still kind of post yourself here and there going on dates, you know.
[35:45] But to the people who have partners, some of you guys have families. It's like that's also a very consistent thing that you guys post about and talk about, you know.
[35:54] So, I make sure when I talk to you guys or I make sure when I leverage my advertising efforts to speak to potential people who could come into the group that I'm talking to these specific things, you know.
[36:06] I'm I make sure that I understand you guys. Okay? Most of you guys also are constantly hard flexing random material items, whether it be a watch, whether it be cars, whether it be like a fucking fancy apartment or a house, you know.
[36:21] Whether it be like flying first class or some of you guys get the opportunity to fly private. There's simply put obviously a lot of hard flexing when it comes to materials, you know.

[37:30] AUDIENCE: More sales.
[37:32] Almost all of you when you first come into the group are trying to get to 100K a month.
[37:38] There's a handful of people that come into the group already either way above that number or like barely above that number who are trying to push up to 500K or even a million a month.
[37:49] But a majority of the people who come into this group, they're somewhere below 100K a month initially. And the first objective that you guys have is to get there as fast as possible. You guys want to get to 100K a month.
[38:02] And there's many of you on this very call that have been in that exact situation. And you can attest literally right now that I've helped you do that. Okay?

[38:27] NICK: Yeah, I was uh I think I was barely cracking 10k a month in profit.
[38:33] Boom. And then to be clear, you do what, like 100 plus K a month in profit now?
[38:39] NICK: Yeah. Last six months I've averaged 112K a month in profit.
[38:45] Boom. So to be clear now you have a completely different set of problems. Obviously now you don't give a fuck about cracking 100K a month in gross revenue.
[38:54] You know now it's like your specific set of problems. The things that you talk to me about are dude I'm trying to fucking push up on the amount that I'm investing.
[39:03] I'm trying to push up on the amount of overall revenue I can make. I'm trying to invest at least 100k a month. You know it's like that's a completely different set of problems. Right.
[39:13] So, moral of the story, there's very different types of people that are in the group. There's, once again, a demographic that's just trying to get to 100K gross per month.
[39:23] And then there's a demographic that's trying to push to like, all right, I I feel rich now, but like, I'm trying to get way fucking richer, and I'm trying to get wealthy.
[39:33] And it's amazing that there's some of you guys who come into the group doing a couple hundred K a month that have literally you never put a fucking dollar into an investment, you know?
[39:43] Uh, you don't have a dollar in your portfolios, you know? Like you just fucking live off the cash flow that you generate every month.
[39:50] And I help you become much more responsible and build for a long-term very very fruitful financial future uh by showing you what I've done to invest several hundred thousand dollars a month for years, you know.
[40:04] And in addition to that, how to push your cash flow to the next level. But once again, it's completely different set of problems.
[40:11] And then on top of that, obviously, there's a lot of value with being able to get to know each other well at every single one of these masterminds we do.
[40:18] You know, four times a year we get the opportunity to meet up with each other and you get the opportunity to mingle with people that are making a lot fucking more than you and people that are making less than you and there's value in both sides of the equation.

[42:37] It's very interesting what they think of people like us, like more of like a white collar professional that just sits at a desk and works all day.
[42:45] It's almost like a derogatory view they have on people like us. They don't look at us as like equals in a sense, you know, as weird as that sounds.
[42:54] As derogatory as that sounds, they they kind of like command a respect of the fact that they're out there doing physical labor, you know, that they have like these specific trades and skills and that they do things in the physical world.
[43:08] You know, they appreciate when somebody recognizes that that's what they do. Blue collar professionals are very different.
[43:15] They also do a fuckload of stimulants. Like a fuckload of stimulants. They might have like a nicotine patch in their mouth 24/7.
[43:23] I know some, to be fair, in the white collar world and the internet money space have started to do the same. But I mean, dude, these guys are like gas station food. They fucking love gas station food for some reason.
[43:35] Like they'll go to 7-Eleven and they'll bang on the pizza. You know what I mean? Or like the hot dogs. It's weird.
[43:42] Like a majority of them will do that no matter what their income level is. I watch Lee Hate, the guy who does 50 million a year as a roofing guy.
[43:51] He will go to 7-Eleven and bang on those little taquitos. You know, he doesn't give a fuck.
[43:56] Point I'm trying to make. Very, very different. How do I know any of that? Because I go and I look up my client's clients and I just follow them, you know.
[44:06] Or I look through their social media feed or I quickly glance through all the stories that they have or in some instances I get the opportunity to meet and see these people in real life at one of their events.
[44:18] They all wear these like either t-shirts or polos, but they're like professionally dressed. Jeans are very common in the blue-collar world.

[44:51] That keep everyday people in great livable conditions from having a proper roof over their head.
[44:57] And then I specify that they can make more money by instead of doing little dinky residential jobs, they can do big-time commercial jobs like what Lee does.

[45:46] Let's use Tai Lopez as an example. Tai Lopez attracts 18 to 25 year old males. Why? Why does Tai go after that demographic?
[45:57] That specific demographic has the highest probability to buy what Tai sells because they're open-minded, extremely money driven.
[46:06] They don't give a fuck about what people think about them yet. They haven't settled into a specific career and developed loss aversion.
[46:15] Thinking that they're abandoning years worth of fucking career that they've developed or a specific set of skills that they've developed.
[46:23] They're the most probable to start a business opportunity that Tai presents to them.
[46:29] In addition to that, 18 to 25 year old men, they're attracted to very specific things that Tai constantly flexes.
[46:37] And those those desires have changed over the years. And what Tai specifically attaches himself to in terms of environments has also adapted over the years. If you've noticed that.
[46:48] If we go back to Peak Tai in 2017 where he's doing 10 mil plus a month off the SMMA, you know, there were simpler times.
[46:57] He had like five supercars in the driveway and he would just be washing them himself. You know, Tai doesn't wash his own fucking cars.
[47:05] Tai's a detailer that comes over once a week and washes all of his cars. But he knows that regardless, he needs to incorporate those into the background of his videos.
[47:15] He knows that there's a specific lifestyle. You know, there's a specific trend right now that's happening on social media. It's like this old money style that people are starting to tap into.
[47:26] You know, they dress a particular way and and they want to be in particular environments. Well, dude, Tai would be on his basketball court with like three models and two German shepherds just shooting basketball.

[48:14] The best people who do this are tying in those two elements. Environment, materials, the literal things that people want, dressed the way that your people want to dress or do dress.
[48:27] The drinks that they drink, and once again, the places they want to be tied in with what specific problems are the high level people actually dealing with that you want to attract.
[48:39] And you just talk about those things while you're in those environments wearing that stuff, drinking what they drink, eating what they eat, whatever. Right? Does that make sense?
[48:49] That's how it goes. You do those two things with very high probability to once again, if you get the messaging right with some of these other principles that we've talked about here today, a very high probability to have success with this.

[49:05] So my point is, okay, we combine all of these assets together. It's okay to obviously provide value and give things away for free, but we want to do so to qualified people.
[49:16] You know, ideally, we literally have like a qualifying question on our lead magnets or a literal application that is disqualifying the brokies and the turds and qualifying the good ones.
[49:28] We do that so we can contextually talk to these people via our marketing automation, via our sales process.
[49:35] We want to pick the right things in terms of what we give away because once again, what we give away that attracts different levels of leads, different types of leads, different financially qualified leads.
[49:47] That includes what we talk about in terms of the problems that they have. Once again, what we say inside of our ads, our funnels, our marketing automation follow-up.
[49:57] These obviously all influence greatly who our ads will attract and who goes through our process in its entirety.
[50:05] It's always important to note once again, you will still get turds, okay? There's no way to avoid turds at 100% qualification ratio, 0% turds. You will always get turds.
[50:18] However, once again, you disqualify them specifically through your funnel process. Like I said, you should have some type of qualifying question that segments your lists.
[50:28] That way you know who's qualified, knows who's not. In terms of qualification ratio, ideally you're getting about 60 to 80% of the total people that come through your process qualified.
[50:39] If you are not, then once again, you know, you have a messaging based issue or potentially you're saying the right things, but you're just not putting yourself in the right environments.
[50:51] Or essentially living in the outcomes that your ideal potential clients want. And it's important to put yourself into those places when you are talking about the right things at the same time.
[51:03] And then to be clear, this is uh like the lesson of secret shopping your sales team. Okay?
[51:09] You want to make sure that you always go out of your way to actually look at like what the fuck a qualified lead of the business actually look like. You know, what are they doing?
[51:19] Can you learn anything from them in terms of the environments that are appropriate to shoot in? Can you learn anything about the habits that they had?
[51:27] Can you see commonalities amongst a couple dozen of them when you go look? You know, can you find out essentially what these people value?
[51:36] And when you do that successfully, you combine all of these together, you have a very, very, very high probability to get your financially qualified buyer leads through the door. Okay.
[51:47] Questions on any of this? Feel free to unmute yourself and ask away. Anybody?
[51:55] All right, cool. Well, it's great talking with you guys. I uh look forward to the opportunity to seeing you guys on July 20th and 21st for our upcoming mastermind.
[52:06] Got a great speaker lineup. This one's pretty deep on AI and a bunch of tech shit. So, pumped to talk with everybody on that.
[52:15] And if you got any questions, per usual, you shoot them over and let me know. All right.
[52:20] AUDIENCE: Thanks, man. Great call.
[52:23] See you later, boys. Peace.

ESTRATÉGIAS E SISTEMAS:
Lead Magnet Qualificado
Não dar lead magnet para todos, apenas para qualificados
Usar application funnel com perguntas qualificadoras
Budget como principal qualificador
Exemplo: render digital gratuito apenas para $50K+ budget
Pergunta Qualificadora Única
Usar pelo menos uma pergunta que segmenta leads
Exemplo: "Você é agency owner, marketer, business owner ou nenhum?"
Permite marketing automation contextual
O Que Você Dá Atrai Quem Você Quer
Dar coisas que resolvem problemas de high-level players
Não focar em problemas de iniciantes
Atrair pessoas já no jogo, com tração
Dois Tipos de Qualificadores
Óbvios: números financeiros diretos ($50K budget, $30-50K investment)
Não-óbvios: situações/circunstâncias específicas (inventory aging, stuck at $200K/month, advertiser sem confiança)
Fórmula do Ad Perfeito
Environment correto (onde seu avatar quer estar)
Materials corretos (o que eles querem ter)
Dress code correto (como eles se vestem)
Food/drinks corretos (o que consomem)
Problemas específicos do nível deles
Tudo junto no mesmo ad
Pesquisa de Avatar
Seguir clientes qualificados no Instagram/Facebook
Observar: workout routines, comida que postam, materiais que flexam, relacionamentos
Identificar padrões em 2-3 dúzias de perfis
Usar insights para criar content e ads
Segmentação de Leads
Separar qualified de unqualified via funnel
Automation diferente para cada segmento
Sales team só fala com qualificados
Turds aspiracionais virão, mas não passam do funnel
Ratio de Qualificação
Meta: 60-80% qualificados, 20-40% não qualificados
Se ratio está ruim (90% não qualificados), problema é messaging
Targeting menos importante que messaging hoje em dia
Estabelecer Expectativas Cedo
Mencionar investment levels logo no pitch
Exemplo: "Nosso cliente médio gasta $30-50K nos primeiros 30 dias"
Age como qualifier e disqualifier simultaneamente
Pesquisa de Clientes dos Clientes
Falar com customers dos seus clientes
Fazer survey calls
Entender problemas específicos de cada nível de renda
Exemplo: blue collar vs white collar completamente diferentes
