Transcrição Completa: 42 Funnel Ads and Marketing Automation Review 3 4 25
[00:00] All right, gentlemen and a few ladies, welcome in. We are doing our weekly funnel review, ad review, and marketing automation review. All exclusive here to the inner circle. Welcome in. It's a pleasure to have you. We've got three different inner circle members today that we're going to be reviewing. Shane, Dicki, and Michael. Michael being one of our newer members.
[00:25] For all those who are unfamiliar, right here inside of this Google doc that is shared every time we paste this video, you can upload your information to be reviewed, including your funnel links, your Facebook ad library, and/or any other ad platform for that matter that you would like to share ads from. You can also organize them in a Google Doc if you'd prefer. Just make it easy to review, simply put.
[00:48] And then lastly, you can also share your marketing automation. And we will review all three in a video just like this. So, take a peek at that doc below this video. If you're inside of the training portal and watching this or inside of Telegram, you should see the link nearby above or below this video.
[01:08] Without further ado, let's dive in. For starters, Shane, uh, you made a link that wasn't clickable. Always make sure you make it clickable, otherwise it makes it a pain in the ass. So, anyway, I already took the liberty before the video to make it a little smoother for y'all. Pasting the link into the uh, Google browser here.
[01:28] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "We'll help you build a profitable Amazon store in 90 days or less, GUARANTEED"
NÚMEROS: 90 dias
VISUAL: Landing page com headline principal, subheadline explicando "without any upfront bulk orders, investing money on ads, marketing experience, or crazy computer skills", vídeo do YouTube com autoplay
[01:30] Let's take a look at what Shane has got going on. So, headline, we'll help you build a profitable Amazon store in 90 days or less, guaranteed uh without any upfront bulk orders, investing money on ads, marketing experience, or crazy computer skills.
[01:48] So, first of all, this is way too similar of a claim to the absolutely horrendous niche of Amazon automation. Shane has a course for all those who don't know. So, what we do know right away is that Shane obviously doesn't have an automation offer. He's doing a done with you or done on your own offer, not a done for you offer.
[02:12] However, Shane, you have to differentiate this and make it extremely clear. Um, as an example of this, uh, just to be clear on this, this is a little bit of a side note. Guaranteed is something that the entire world of people who just purchased Amazon stores learned doesn't mean shit all.
[02:32] Um, guarantees are meaningless. Typically, they create a deal for like a highly skeptical buyer, but what it also does is immediately creates like a really poor incentive. Um, people like guarantees because it means they don't have to do anything.
[02:48] So, like as an example, when we as a marketing agency historically have tested guarantees, we do all the hard work and they don't do shit anything because at the end of the day, they get their money back if it doesn't work. So, they don't give a fuck. You know, it creates an awful incentive versus as soon as we removed guarantees in literally any and every program.
[03:12] We saw a monumental shift in the people that we're working with actually putting in effort to get results. So, this is very important. Guarantees are pretty much not real. Because what I meant to say here when I'm talking about the Amazon automation niche, proving that guarantees aren't real.
[03:32] All those businesses just went bankrupt, you know, and all the people that were contracted with guarantees, like literally contracts are learning the hard way that if a business goes bankrupt, the guarantee doesn't mean anything at all. So guarantees to a sophisticated buyer, sophisticated people know it is meaningless.
[03:52] The only type of people you typically attract with guarantees are fucking poor people or people that aren't going to put in effort that essentially want to rob you of your time invested, your effort invested, your resources expensed on them, and then just get their money back at the end of the day. You know, terrible incentive.
[04:12] So, what I would encourage is is swapping out the word guaranteed for a parentheses done with you or parentheses like done on your own, you know, or if it is a done for you, parenthesis done for you. That would be a whole lot better and a whole lot more clear and immediately establish some differentiation from the automation offers.
[04:35] You have to differentiate from the automation guys. That niche is so horrendously violently bad that you having this level of similarity to it will immediately cause people to leave. Okay? So be mindful of that.
[04:48] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Vídeo YouTube com autoplay ativo
NÚMEROS: N/A
VISUAL: Player do YouTube incorporado na página, controles de vídeo visíveis na parte inferior, botão de play/pause e controle de volume
[04:50] Also, if we refresh the page here, I notice right away that you use autoplay in a YouTube player. Not a good play to use YouTube. First of all, it just generally looks like shit. Two, whenever you autoplay, people then have to go down here on a mobile device and be able to click with their thumbs the little uh make the sound work button.
[05:15] And on mobile, by the way, it looks a lot different than what it does here on a tablet or even on a desktop. Sometimes the little control doesn't even show up and they have to click on three little dots to get all the controls to show up. Simply put, it creates a huge like UI issue straight away.
[05:32] Don't autoplay videos. This is why we constantly use platforms like Wistia. Even Vidalytics as an example has been a recent one that's been coming up that's been doing quite well and trying to differentiate from platforms like Wistia as an example. But both Wistia and Vidalytics offer video thumbnails which are engaging and inviting and welcoming to get people to press play, but it's not an autoplay video.
[05:58] So anyway, this can't stress it enough is also punishable in search engines. Pages like this don't rank in search engines because again the entire internet the people who control the internet that own the browsers they fucking hate autoplay videos. So you get punished for that.
[06:15] Also little known fact you typically see much higher CPMs when you have autoplay videos because again they lend an awful UI experience historically to the people who hit the page.
[06:25] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Typeform embed com "Powered by Typeform" logo
NÚMEROS: N/A
VISUAL: Formulário Typeform incorporado, logo "Powered by Typeform" dominante no canto inferior direito, problema de UI com botão "OK" sobreposto
[06:28] Um second to that and this just might be a glitch. We'll refresh the page and see if it is or not. Um, here in your type form, you can see that there's this really weird uh like UI issue. So, the okay is for the information that's submitted. Again, it just looks really weird and it functions really weird.
[06:48] Um, I don't know if you're paying for Typeform or not. I assume you're not because you have this powered by Typeform logo in the bottom right. Uh, just paid a couple bucks for Typform, dude. Get rid of the powered by Typeform thing. you could see how dominating it is from like an attention standpoint.
[07:08] You know, it really strips away a lot of the uh the attention simply put that would otherwise go to this. And then like I said, there's just this UI issue with the type form. Usually, you can fix this by just increasing the length of the pixels. So, type form as an embed typically defaults to a 500 pixel limit. You ideally will expand that upwards to about 800 pixels. Um that'll that'll give you a much better time.
[07:35] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Hear from others who started selling on Amazon"
NÚMEROS: N/A
VISUAL: Seção de depoimentos com múltiplos vídeos do YouTube incorporados em grid, thumbnails de vídeos visíveis, texto sobreposto nos players
[07:38] Okay. and then hear from others who started selling on Amazon. U also super advanced thing. This might seem like I'm nitpicking. I'm really not trying to. Uh VAK, visual auditory kinesthetic taught by Richard Bandler. It's a system for how people express themselves and how people interpret information.
[07:58] And visual people are the dominating niche out of all human beings. It's kind of like right-handed people being a lot more uh prevalent in comparison to left-handed people or ambidextrous people that can use both. Um visual people and then auditory people. Auditory people is the smallest niche of people that both prefer to consume that way and prefer to express themselves that way.
[08:22] Kinesthetic kinesiology but mainly again just the word kinesthetic in this case are people who like to express themselves with emotion or interpret things with emotion and feeling. Okay. So you're using the word hear. Okay, this expresses that you are trying to mainly get information consumed by the auditory demographic.
[08:42] Which if you're visual or again if you're kinesthetic and that's your preferred input, which a majority of people are like right-handed people, um right away on a very subconscious level, I know this is kind of crazy. It might seem nit nitpicky and like I'm reaching. I'm not. We actually seen a pretty dramatic difference in doing this.
[09:02] Um, I'd rather you say something like see, you know, see from others or see what others have generated as a result, you know, like use words that are visual and then use words that are like verbs. Kinesiology or kinesthetic people, they prefer like again like anything that's an action or a feeling, you know.
[09:22] So see what others are generating from their Amazon stores. See and then generated would be the two things that appeal to visual and kinesthetic people there. Um wouldn't again wouldn't isolate it to just hear. Okay.
[09:38] And then there's uh, you know, an effort here to use like quotes from what people said from these videos. As you can see, you can't read literally anything that's at the top in that bar there. And people won't try to like what we're doing now. What I'm saying is, and you might not have even saw it to be clear if you're watching this video here, like all that stuff at the top is just fucking invisible.
[10:02] And then same thing with the stuff at the bottom. When there's that overlapping YouTube logo, it just looks like shit. Also, you're just inviting people to go off the platform. Three separate instances um on this page in the main video in all of these different uh uh players here.
[10:22] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Footer da página - ausência de links legais
NÚMEROS: N/A
VISUAL: Rodapé da página sem Terms of Service, Privacy Policy ou Income Disclaimer, apenas disclaimer básico visível
[10:25] You also don't have a terms of service on the page. U you got to have terms of service to technically be compliant from an advertising perspective. Also, any lawyer would tell you to make sure that you have terms of service. Uh it helps a lot. Um in addition to that, you don't have a a privacy policy.
[10:45] So, you have all kinds of issues just by not having a terms of service or a privacy policy. And then in addition to that, I see that you have like a light disclaimer here at the bottom. Um, it doesn't look like it's an income disclaimer, though. With an offer like yours that's like a make money offer, you really got to have something that's like, you know, compliant disclaimer at the bottom, which could be an additional third link.
[11:08] By the way, um, again, can't stress it enough. This would look a whole lot better if it was hosted on Wistia or Vidalytics with video thumbnails. Also, just given that there are what? 1 2 4 6 8 10 of these. Um, I'd rather see that you stack them, you know, just one one one.
[11:28] And then that give you an opportunity to be able to um express like in a bigger way what those testimonials actually say. So, like if you look here as an example, this is a Wistia video thumbnail and then right below that we have the quote that's pulled from the actual video that's right above it.
[11:48] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Exemplo de página com Wistia - depoimentos bem formatados
NÚMEROS: N/A
VISUAL: Comparação visual entre página com Wistia (thumbnails profissionais, quotes grandes e legíveis) vs YouTube (múltiplos players vermelhos, branding do YouTube dominante)
[11:50] And each video thumbnail, if you actually are attentive to it, is something that would draw in a viewer. So, moral of the story is, you can just see such a tremendous difference between how this looks, how engaging it is, how welcoming it is, and also just how impactful the actual testimonial feels.
[12:08] Even if you don't watch it, just how big it is, can make a tremendous difference to the psychology of interpreting a testimonial a particular way. When you look at yours in comparison, like just look how look how different these are. You see this just kind of looks like shit you know.
[12:28] And also you lose a lot of branding. YouTube is essentially branding themselves on your page more than you are. You have a good style of page from about here until here. Once you get here, you can just see all this YouTube red. Okay, it's very important to note YouTube being a part of Google, a multi-hundred if not trillion dollar company by now.
[12:50] Um they have a tremendous amount of mental space already in somebody's head that um you know, you don't want to play into when you're trying to brand yourself and your business. So, just keep all that in mind. U the only thing that I do like on the page about the uh video itself is just look at the end of the day like YouTube's a familiar thing.
[13:12] So, I'm not I'm not uh hating on the fact that it's hosted in YouTube. It's just a lot of UI issues that it causes.

VISUAL: Vídeo principal da página, Shane apresentando seu programa, mini webinar framework sendo utilizado
[13:22] Years, I've been able to help 458 brand new Amazon sellers start and scale a really profitable Amazon business within 90 days, all utilizing the world's most popular platform, Amazon. And these are people who either work a 9 to 5 job, want to supplement their income, or people who are entrepreneurs that are looking for their next business to start up.
[13:48] And over the last four years, I've built out a program called Amazon Selling Secrets Unlocked, which includes access to a 10-part video training program.
[13:58] Nice. Following the mini webinar framework. That's good to see. Okay, great. Uh, let's take a peek at some of these ads here from the Facebook ad library for Shane. By the way, you'll notice JH with a little melon logo on my cup here. Got to have some branded cups in your crib, you know.
[14:18] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Facebook Ad Library - Shane's ads
NÚMEROS: N/A
VISUAL: Interface do Facebook Ad Library mostrando múltiplos anúncios ativos, thumbnails de vídeos, headlines visíveis
[14:22] All right. So, how to sell profitable items on Amazon. Don't do Amazon FBA. Do this instead. Okay. Um, looks like we have the same video a few different times. Cool. All right, let's take a look at some of these ad videos.
[14:38] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Ad copy - "375 everyday people"
NÚMEROS: 375 pessoas, 90 dias, $213K spend nos últimos 2 meses
VISUAL: Anúncio do Facebook com vídeo, copy descrevendo resultados, métricas de gastos visíveis
[14:40] Why is it that some people start selling on Amazon and make thousands in their first 90 days while others can't even make a sale? Are they smarter, luckier, maybe better at business? No. See, the difference is that they know something you don't. How to find hot selling products from domestic-based suppliers and set up their stores for success.
[15:02] Now, here's the good news. I can teach you exactly what they know. I'll help you find the right products and the right suppliers. I'll show you how to set up your Amazon store to make consistent and daily sales.
[15:18] Honestly, I think the video could have just started right there. It's not a bad video, but I'd love to see a split test that starts off just a few seconds earlier where it says, "I'll help you find profitable. I'll help you do this. I'll help you do that." I think that'd be a great place to start the video, too.
[15:35] Also, super non-compliant. Always funny to see how much training you guys get exposed to for me on compliance and yet you guys just don't give a fuck and you constantly break compliance. 213K over the last two months will eventually get this ad flagged when you start spending some money. Kind of keep that in mind.
[15:55] Um, also you have a discrepancy from the people that you say you helped here. You say you have 375 everyday people. Yet on your page in the first couple seconds you say in the 400.
[16:08] Hey there. What's up? My name is Shane and over the last four years I've been able to help 458.
[16:15] So you say 458 there, but here in your copy you say 375. So that'll also create a little bit of distrust straight away.
[16:25] I'll help you automate everything so that way it runs smoothly so you can just simply enjoy your life. And if that doesn't work out, then you don't pay anything. And how can I make such a bold claim? Well, pretty simply said, you can take a look at all the results. I've done this for the last four years myself, but I've also helped over 600 people start selling profitable products on.
[16:48] Again, this number, I mean, you're just pulling numbers out of your ass at this point. Copy says 375, VSL says 458, now you say over 600.

[17:12] income time frame
[17:15] $4.75 million in total sales or even someone like Le James with in his first week
[17:22] cherry picked testimonials you have to actually demonstrate the two true average first of all it's FTC compliance 101 and then second to that just creates distrust you got to be able to say I hope that you're going to follow up with this by the way that you immediately disclose although yes those are some of our students that have gotten better results through time. We also typically average X of a result for somebody who signs up with us in whatever time frame was
[17:48] able to do over $7,000 with his Amazon business in just 7 days. Someone like Bal who did $4,000 in her first week. Someone like Chanel who did $21,000 in her first 6 days of starting. The list goes on. Now, all you need to do to figure out how this can work.
[18:08] Yeah, a lot of distrust there. Um, okay. So, same copy as last one, different video.

VISUAL: Outro anúncio em vídeo do Facebook, Shane usando linguagem de "automação"
[18:18] All you need to start selling products on Amazon is a laptop and a Wi-Fi connection. If you have those two things and you want to sell profitable items on Amazon, then listen up. I will help you build a fully automated Amazon business and help you find winning products that sell.
[18:38] I don't know why you are using words like automated when that niche is literally the most like hazardous worst possible thing to associate yourself with. I would imagine that you are like stuck at a particular benchmark in revenue and just dealing with a lot of distrust.
[18:55] Um, I can't stress it enough like the quantity of people who likely see your stuff that just immediately say, "Oh, this guy's full of shit. Another automation guy is probably extreme." You also are really welcoming a lot of attention from the government organizations that manage this space. They are on this shit like flies on shit. Excuse me.
[19:18] at least 10 times every single day in the next 90 days, guaranteed. And you can do this without spending money on ads, without needing any marketing experience, building a website, or even placing any bulk orders. First, I'll teach you everything you need to know about how Amazon drop.
[19:35] Yeah, Shane, I mean, you really just got to continuously say like, look, this is a done with you offer where you are going to own the store completely. We have no operational involvement whatsoever. we will sell you a course and hold your hand along the way of you executing the course. Uh I would love for you to just be super vocal about that.
[19:58] I can't stress that enough. Like there was so much ad dollars spent by the automation companies just fucking hammering people on extremely similar lines as this that you're just you're flying too close to the sun here, dude. Like this is a major uh association issue, you know? You just can't be associated with people like that.
[20:22] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Don't do Amazon FBA. Instead, do this one business model"
NÚMEROS: N/A
VISUAL: Shane apresentando modelo alternativo ao FBA, criticando custos upfront e fulfillment fees
[20:25] Don't do Amazon FBA. Instead, do this one business model that nobody else is talking about. You see, the problem with Amazon FBA is that you're placing a lot of your hard-earned money at risk of being lost. You're placing bulk orders before a product even actually sells, and you're also giving majority of your profits to Amazon because you're utilizing their fulfillment services.
[20:48] And not to mention, you also need to spend money upfront on advertisements to get your products to sell. But with something called an Amazon drop shipping business, you don't have to worry about any of that. You see, because you can be able to sell big
[21:05] I mean, dude, Amazon and drop shipping is like I I just I mean, dude, it's like so disappointing even hear you talk about this. Amazon, you can't you cannot drop ship on Amazon, dude. Everybody fucking knows that. Like, the automation people lighting hundreds of millions of dollars on fire and vaporizing it uh made the niche extremely aware that drop shipping is utter shit on Amazon.
[21:32] non-compliant gets store shut down. There is an unbound amount of information. Like I'll give you a perfect example. If we literally go onto Google and just type in Amazon dropshipping. Let's see what comes up. Like let's just truly search for it and uh find out.
[21:50] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Google search results - "Amazon dropshipping"
NÚMEROS: N/A
VISUAL: Página de resultados do Google mostrando artigos sobre dropshipping na Amazon, incluindo artigo oficial da Amazon (sell.amazon.com)
[21:52] Okay, so Amazon drop shipping is a business model that allows seller to partner with third parties to fulfill orders customers. The sellers responsible for setting prices. Okay, so that's some good news for you. That's not bad. Um, what is drop shipping? How does it work? Okay, good. So, this is some information and this is from Amazon.com. That's really good.
[22:15] What is drop shipping? How does it work in 2025? Dude, this is awesome. So Shane, just to be clear, like even my own mindset about drop shipping, like I was literally just articulating to you, I'm under the impression as a consumer of this entire niche and as somebody that like heavily participated in it from the automation perspective.
[22:38] They have conditioned like the consumer to think Amazon and drop shipping is utter fucking bullshit. And here we are like reading about drop shipping on Amazon's website directly. Like this is huge. I would love to literally see that same ad that you just shot more from like an education perspective.
[22:58] Like this hook right here would fucking bang when you say to start off the ad. Everybody thinks that you can't drop ship on Amazon. Well, why does Amazon on their website sell.amazon.com have an entire article and then like pull up the article and show it like going through it literally teaching and talking about how drop shipping works?
[23:22] Why would they do that if it's not something you could actually execute on their platform? Well, people have done it wrong and therefore the association of drop shipping on Amazon has become notorious for scams and something that's non-compliant and something that will get your store shut down when in reality it's one of the most profitable ways if you do it compliantly and how Amazon wants you to do it.
[23:48] You see, a lot of the issues with drop shippers on Amazon historically have been they would buy stuff from competitors like Walmart as an example. And so when somebody would order something off Amazon and a Walmart box would show up at their house, they would hate that.
[24:05] The compliant way to actually do drop shipping on Amazon is XYZ. And that's what we teach you to do. As a matter of fact, we have a done with you offer where we will hold your hand, give you access to a course, help you do product research, but we will also ensure that you get the benefits of drop shipping.
[24:25] Which mean you will not have upfront inventory costs. You will not have to do bulk orders. You will not to have you will not have to have some giant storage facility or warehouse space. You won't even have to use Amazon FBA. So, you'll be able to pocket about a 35% savings right off the top of your margin straight into your pocket instead.
[24:48] I can teach you exactly how compliant Amazon drop shipping works. Like Shane, that would be a fucking money hook. Compliant Amazon drop shipping. Okay.

Um, this takes them to YouTube. Yeah, cool. Why saving money is making you poor. Nice. Yeah. So, over 60% of the world's money supply was printed last year.
[28:52] First of all, no, it wasn't. That was in uh COVID. And you got to update that, you know, cuz again, if you're selling to like literal retards, then maybe they'll believe you on that. But dude, if you're ever in any way, shape, or form selling to somebody who's actually rich and not dumb as fuck when you say something like that, it immediately just like, "What the fuck is this guy? Does this guy know anything he's talking about?"
[29:18] Just loses credibility straight away when you say random things that aren't true. But I understand the point. Rework that email a little bit. Make it a lot better than it is. You don't need a lot of time for this side hustle. Uh, you probably have a regular day job. Yeah, cool.
[29:35] You know what I would like to see that I feel like is missing, especially from these first few emails, is a set of emails that actually addresses like the things they're going to think about, right? Some of the things they're probably going to think about is, "Okay, I have no fucking clue what kind of products I'm actually going to be able to find that are going to sell on this platform."
[29:58] And on top of that, I don't think I'm any way, shape, or form going to rank on one of the first pages if I actually do find a product, even if it's good. How in the fuck am I going to sell a random product that I just find on Amazon when I'm probable to be ranking amongst the last pages for whatever that search term is?
[30:18] I would love to see an email that like technically explains how you overcome that kind of objection. Keep in mind like all these first emails, the your skepticism part, like that's cool, but I mean from there it's like all of them should be like like addressing real things that they actually give a fuck about.
[30:38] All these things that you're doing so far, obviously they're already sold on selling on Amazon. Like email seven, why are so many people turning to Amazon? Like they're already sold on Amazon, dude. Sell them on the things that are going to hold them back from actually executing on selling on Amazon. You know what I mean?
[30:58] Like come up with real shit that they genuinely give a fuck about. All you're doing here is just flexing testimonials and answering like super fucking basic questions. You know, these are like really basic, like poor people framing techniques. All right. Anyway, a lot of room to improve there. Uh, take action on everything that I spoke about. You'll for sure do a lot better than you are right now.

[31:52] So, first of all, Dicki is teaching premium ghost writing. So, premium ghostwriting blueprint, five steps to become a premium ghost writer. Uh, we got a simple opt-in here. Capturing just email, terms of service, privacy policy. Very good. Okay. Five steps make premium ghost rider.

[32:32] So, all the bold, what we just did there, by the way, is we just read bold, bold, bold, bold, bold. Ideally, when you read a bold section, it just flows extremely well. Okay, good example of this. Let me see if this is the right domain. It's been a long time since I've seen this.

[32:55] All right, so if you go here to this 50k agency.com site, this is a page I wrote when I was like fucking 23 years old. Um, if you just read the bold things on this page, okay, and you didn't read literally anything else, you would still get the whole concept of the page just by reading the bold stuff. You know what I mean?
[33:15] So, my point is is this is really done, you know, somewhat well by you here, Dicki. I think there could be a little bit of improvement. U, but overall, again, really good. Uh, what's a sneak peek before you sign up? This is a great section to have added here. Let's go ahead and throw an email in to Dicky's funnel.

[33:38] Okay, so right away we get a apply to join PGA for one-on-one coaching to start your ghost writing business. I'd be interested to see how this converts. Again, we have this uh this formatting issue with type form here due to the powered by type form thing showing up. I've noticed that it's only prevalent when it's the powered by type form that seems to be what causes this issue.
[34:02] Yeah, I mean I'd be really interested to see the statistics on this Dicki for how your application rate is. I would imagine what would be really good right here is just a nice VSSL right below the headline and right before this set of subtext that you've got below it where it says the first lesson of this email course is on the way to your inbox.
[34:25] I would I would really love to see I mean this honestly I think would actually be an even better headline and I think this current headline would be like you just you just flip-flop these two. You know what I mean? get this big headline to be this first sentence and get this first sentence to be the big headline because that's technically a lot more contextual to what they actually just did, right?
[34:48] They just opted in for something and they want to see what the fuck they just did being confirmed. You know what I mean? Like give them a confirmation that they actually got it. And then have a video right there, dude. Nice Wistia or Vidalytics video right there with a good video thumbnail inviting them in to watch the video imploring them to schedule a call and apply and like telling them why they should.
[35:12] I think that's missing here cuz other than that it's like I mean it just feels like such a rough transition, you know, feels like you're going in with no lube or something. It's really rough. Didn't make a lot of sense. I just feel there's a gigantic disconnect that's likely occurring.
[35:28] This as a great example would be something to point out that could cause tremendous show rate issues and like framing issues when people do show up to the call because it's like what what are they applying for? You know what I mean? Just doesn't make much. They don't know what the fuck PGA is. You know what I mean?
[35:48] Uh and they're and also based on what they just opted in for. Uh five steps to become a premium ghost rider, right? So then all of a sudden I'm talking about one-on-one coaching to start a ghostwriting business. Not a huge disconnect, but again, a VSSL would make that transition so much smoother. I'd love to see that.

Um, I love that a few of them have first and last names because believe it or not, the skeptical people or the analytical people will actually look that up and try to find out where those people are.
[36:35] And um, you know, try to talk to them and ask them like, "Hey, are you a real person?" And like, "Do you actually care about this?" Okay, cool. Well, anyway, um, we also have Dicky's Facebook ad library here. Let's take a peek at that.

[39:02] It's much easier to go find one client that is willing to pay you three grand, four grand, 5 grand to do something for them. So, it's actually monetizing through a service.

[40:05] How could you be struggling as a freelance writer when you could just do this? Okay, seriously, watch carefully. How could you be struggling as a freelance writer when you could just call yourself a ghostwriter? Ghostwriters on average make more money than freelance writers. So just by calling yourself a ghostwriter means you make more money. It seems like a big change, but it's
[40:28] by the way, I know we're only 23 seconds into the VSSL and you might imply this within the next few seconds, but it'd be really good to pepper in right away. Even if you're not a freelance writer right now and you just want to become a ghost writer, pay attention. You know, something that implies that it's more inclusive to people beyond just freelance writers. Otherwise, it makes me feel like it's not for me right away.
[40:52] Okay, the second ad, by the way, infinitely better than the first ad. The first ad was so fucking weird. It almost makes me feel like that was an editing mistake and that you don't actually know that that's running. Uh, the second ad, way better. Like fucking night and day difference.

[41:15] Tell me about the 10x choice writers and ghost writers have to make. the 10x choice. We use that language to say when you get to around 10 grand a month, you have a decision to make, which is basically, do you want to stay around where you're at and optimize for life, you know, work life balance as people call it.
[41:35] Or do you want to scale to 100 grand a month, but you probably won't have much of a social life in the short term, you know, cuz things are always harder and take longer and are more expensive than people think. That's just a great rule of thumb. Anytime you do anything in life, assume it will take twice as long and will cost you twice as much.
[41:55] Hey, if you want to accelerate your career.
[41:58] Okay. Yeah. Really interesting strategy here. Just like pull these random clips again. Like that one I'd probably rank it in second place comparatively. So the So the second one up here, that one was the best by far. U this first one I wouldn't even fucking rank. I think it's terrible. This one's not awful, but again, it's like pretty far off from how good the first one was.

[42:25] Alex from Mozy's monologues go viral because he uses this secret writing technique. Listen to this sentence and then I'll tell you what he's doing.
[42:35] If you think about the difference between winners and losers, winners define themselves by what they made happen and losers define themselves by what happened to them.
[42:45] This is what's called an antithesis, which is an obvious observation followed by a non-obvious observation. Writers have been doing this since the days of Shakespeare. Okay? Or here's a different one.
[42:58] Sadness is a perceived lack of options. Anxiety is many options but no priorities. Hormozi calls this unbundling or operationalizing language, but writers have been using this mechanism which is called a mirrorism for centuries. A mirrorism is when
[43:15] that one's good and it also transitions over to that same hook at the end.

[43:25] Do free work for people that have thriving businesses because just you being in their presence just like your team members saw you make that decision that changed how they thought about it. When you do free work for someone else and you see them make that decision, you're getting paid in pattern recognition.
[43:45] You're getting paid in experience, you know, and you have to realize that in the beginning, getting paid in cash is actually not the most valuable thing for you. You want to get paid in confidence. I can do this. You want to get paid in building a network. Oh, now I know someone who can introduce me to other clients. There are a lot of things more valuable than getting paid a hundred bucks or a thousand bucks.
[44:08] I don't like that one at all. I think that it's going to be a really like off-putting thing for people that obviously want to make more money and like are going to justify paying for your program.

[44:52] If you're risk averse, chances are it's just because you haven't felt that there's another option. But the moment that you feel, oh, there is another way that I can go, then it just becomes a well, are you curious enough to keep going or not? And the decision keep going or not is a lot easier than start something totally new or don't. Hey, if you want to accelerate your career,
[45:15] yeah, I mean, just I don't think that one makes much sense, you know? Just same kind of same kind of logic as the previous video.

[47:08] And then we have the email series. I assume this is for the opt-in since that's essentially what you had. Um, education email course. Yeah, got it. So, you're doing a full course in the email here. I would imagine you make a fuckload of money doing this with that opt-in the way that you described it there.
[47:28] Would love to see some of the statistics on this. Dicki, this is a very well-built email sequence just based on how descript it is and obviously how much information you're consistently pushing in front of people.
[47:45] And for everybody who's watching this trying to learn lessons from it, Dicki, and you could see in almost every email is making a lot of resources available to people, which in turn dramatically increases the total consumption time and obviously increases the willingness to purchase.
[48:05] There's a good rule of thumb, especially in the info product world, but it really applies to almost everything. The more time that somebody spends on your business, whether it's just doing something as simple as like, let's say it's an e-commerce store, right?

NÚMEROS: N/A
VISUAL: Exemplo de bracelete David Yurman usado pelo revisor, demonstração de brand affinity através de tempo gasto
[48:25] Like these bracelets, this is from a company called David Yurman. There's a lot of time throughout a week where I'll just go on David Yurman's website and just fucking browse it and see if there's other cool shit that I can buy for myself or for my fiance, you know?
[48:45] Like there's a lot of, simply put, just time that I spend with that business. And as a result, I also like when I'm walking around the design district earlier today, I was going to Laurel Piano to buy some shoes for my fiance and I would see like David Yurman ads, you know, and again just make me think like, oh, I have good brand affinity with them.
[49:08] There wasn't a David Yurman in the Miami Design District. But my point is if there was like there's a really high probability that I go in there and I spend some money because of the amount of time I spend with the brand.
[49:25] So it's applicable not just for info products, it's applicable for any business. The more time that somebody spends with a business, the more willingness there is to spend money with that business. Makes sense, right? The more out of mind and out of sight that a business is, the less probable that somebody is to actually purchase and spend any money with you.
[49:48] So my point being all of this that you see here, this is just them, Dicky and his partner here, Nicholas, taking all of the content that they have and in addition to that, making a lot of the content available right there in the email to make somebody not only consume information, but kind of become indoctrinated into their world of starting to become a ghostwriting copywriter, which is really good to see.
[50:15] I think you're doing this really well, Dicky. I really have a lot of criticism for this. Um, good job. A lot of improvement on the ads that can be made. uh tremendous amount of improvement that can be made on the funnel as well that you send to people right after they opt in. Uh I think the email sequence is really good. I think you're I think you're leading that for sure. That seems to be your strong point.

NÚMEROS: $300K-$500K/mês revenue, ~30% opt-in to booking rate
VISUAL: Transição para terceiro membro, Michael, que roda duas empresas de seguro no UK
[50:42] Okay. And then uh finally here we've got a few different funnels from one of our new inner circle members, Michael. Michael runs two different versions of insurance companies in the UK. He was showing me this yesterday or the day before on our one-on-one call together.
[51:02] And long story short, it's a very simple opt-in funnel that drives a tremendous amount of lead flow to their setters. And the people who opt into this then eventually become a potential call. They get about 30-ish% of people who go through this very funnel that we see right here um to actually then go book.
[51:25] So, long story short, the revenue that Michael's noticed comes from his business. He's just shy of half a million dollars a month, give or take the month, like three to 400k a month. most of the money that they see that's like correlated to a leading indicator is lead volume.
[51:45] So the more inbound leads that Michael Michael can generate typically the more revenue that they can generate on the back end. So the main issue right now is not necessarily that there's like a problem with the funnel or like a problem with the opt-ins. It's more so can there be like little tweaks that are made as an example to people booking calls.

[52:32] And then there's just this kind of again like really abrupt transition to booking a call. People need reasons to do things. So, Michael and everybody else sitting here watching this, it's really important to remember you have to give people reasons to do something. Okay?
[52:52] So, you gave a really strong reason here to fill out this form, which is, okay, I just want to find out if I'm eligible for private sick pay. A really strong reason here, which could also just be a very simple headline, is why am I going to fucking book the call? Okay, what's the reason? Why am I going to take the action?
[53:12] I think a really good reason to emphasize here that I think would make a big difference is telling people, hey, book your call so you can get started with applying for sick pay. You know, something like that. I think that would make a lot of sense. Um, I also think that would drive up your booking rate tremendously comparatively to what it is right now.

[53:38] There's also this secondary brand called Daddy Insurance. Just another spin essentially on selling somewhat of the same thing. just sick pay but isolated for this. Um quite interesting to see by the way there's a subtle difference in branding here. More masculine colors are prevalent.
[53:58] Only thing I don't like is again it just kind of seems like it's framed around getting a quote and I highly doubt that there's going to be a quote that comes after it. But hey, maybe there is. Let's check out the thank you page for it. So somebody would pick out and again same exact information just colored differently. So, same lesson applies.
[54:22] Long story short, some kind of transition headline that gives people a solid reason to actually do stuff. Okay, I think that would be huge. And then Michael and I, we already reviewed all of his ads yesterday. He's just doing a tremendous amount of image ads.

[54:42] Um, all of which, by the way, if I just take a moment to show you real fast, you can see this. They're all like these crazy little images. And, uh, Michael has a team of real salespeople. So although there's for most of the internet businesses out there a tremendous issue with, you know, only having this level of frame on somebody.
[55:05] Uh, Michael actually does a really good job with these types of leads that come in because simply put, uh, they're all real salespeople on the back end. So they're extremely aggressive. They follow up. Like they're they're a setter team of people who only care about somebody having relative interest to what they could sell them.
[55:28] They don't give a fuck if they're framed well or not. They just care about the fact they have somebody to dial. And they do really well with doing that, by the way, because again, that's what that's what real sales teams have. They have like just really aggressive, hungry sales people that do great jobs.
[55:48] You'll notice there's very few if any video ads. Almost all of them are these like wonky little images. So anyway, pretty good job. Um, love to see it.
[56:02] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: Email automation - apenas confirmação básica
NÚMEROS: N/A
VISUAL: Single email de confirmação do Go High Level, oportunidade perdida para sequência completa
[56:05] And then also you'll notice here at the bottom Michael input the single email that he has which is just this basic uh confirmation email that goes out from go high levels calendar. So also Michael obviously there's a tremendous amount of leverage in having a actually well-built email sequence rather than this singular fucking confirmation email that you've got now.
