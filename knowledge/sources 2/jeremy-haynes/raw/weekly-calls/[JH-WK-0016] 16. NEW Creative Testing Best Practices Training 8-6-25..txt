Transcrição Completa: 16 NEW Creative Testing Best Practices Training 8 6 25
[00:00] "So, a lot's changed with the Meta Andromeda update, and that directly correlates to creative testing best practices. We've kind of held back a little bit on updating this specific class for a little over a month and a half now, while we work through how some of the creative best practices are on our end with all our clients at high spend."
[00:23] "We have a handful of clients that all in all were about 500 to 1.5 million ad spend each over the last month and a half. We have a substantial amount of creative testing that we've done for them and the process has changed rather dramatically."
[00:40] "So, long story short, without further ado, we're going to dive into it. First of all, you obviously want to be familiar with Andromeda and all of what we've already talked about related to that."
[00:52] "So, to be clear, if for some reason this is your first time hearing about Andromeda, then go get schooled up on that. Inside of our SOP master list and everything that you guys get access to, we have what we call the ad diversification mastery SOP."

[01:12] "This is essentially going through Andromeda. We also have a weekly group call on Andromeda. So, keep that in mind. There's two different resources on this. Weekly group call and then the creative diversification SOP."
[01:26] "Simply put, in a nutshell, Andromeda does extremely well when you load up a bunch of creative into it. But the creative needs to be very well diversified."

NÚMEROS: 3 componentes principais

[01:42] "What they mean by that is they have three things specifically that they look for and they call it themes, messaging, and the visuals. These are the three things that they talk extensively about in all the documentation that they released related to Andromeda that they claim that they want."
[02:00] "What we found is two out of the three don't actually mean anything. The only one that actually matters is messaging."

[02:12] "So, we proved this through our Andrew Lamb client test, who's also here in the inner circle with us. We had Andrew stand in front of a bookshelf."
[02:23] "Andrew, you know, no offense to Andrew when I say this, a pretty like neutral, like emotionally neutral guy when he films his ads. It doesn't come off as very exciting. It doesn't come off as like he's like, you know, one of those tryhard guys that's like 'stop', you know, and like has some weird personality when he films his stuff. It's just a normal looking dude filming normal looking ads."
[02:48] "And he shot a total of 15 creatives standing in the exact same spot, the exact same clothes, the exact same facial expressions. Literally, the only difference in what he did was say things differently."

[03:08] "And we've already shared this before, but just to reiterate also inside of all the resources that we give you guys access to, we shared this, which were those 15 different ads and the exact scripts that we wrote for those."
[03:22] "So, long story short, we have again a total of 15 of the exact scripts that were used. And we went through this on one of our previous calls and we'll kind of reference it a little bit on this."
[03:34] "But just so we're all on the same page to start, every single one of these creatives is unique through and through. Like the only words that are shared are a handful. The main reasons to buy are completely different."
[03:50] "And long story short, again, as it relates to messaging, we proved that we had the best cost that we could get on that specific account."

[04:30] "So, if we look at the account here, let me just grab all the campaigns specifically that we ran for this. So, let's look at these stats here. Here's the July numbers. Look at the cost per call. This is a cost per qualified call, $56.54. $673 total calls."
[04:52] "And you can see how it's broke down. The warm audience stack and then three different cold ad sets. This is two campaigns here that we're looking at. The warm is in one campaign and the cold are in one campaign."
[05:08] "These are all ABOs and each one in this case contains 10 total creatives. This was the account that we wanted to test on specifically to see if we could maintain with dynamic creative because this account didn't have all those stupid toggles turned on."

[05:30] "So anyway, long story short, here's August. August we had a little bit more spend, not by much. We had 931 total calls. Cost per call barely went up."
[05:43] "Just to be clear, a lot of the reason this was inflated because the calendars were being too packed out. He had about a 72-hour window that you could book. Most of those calls were being booked on the 72nd hour on that third day. So just a slightly higher cost due to limitations."

[06:08] "And then again, look at this specific month so far. 182 calls, $65. That is without a single change inside of the ads. There was no new ads launched. There was no fatigue."
[06:24] "And there was higher levels of spend throughout that duration of time. There's no sign at all that we are in the middle of fatiguing. And again, the literal only time that I've had an increase in cost was specifically during the period of time that I had no availability to book into."
[06:43] "And then Andrew would open up the availability and try to hire more closers. So again, here's my point. Here's like the whole thing that I'm trying to emphasize."

[07:00] "Through diversified messaging specifically, we have a lot of longevity in our creatives. We're seeing cheaper costs across the board when we have these best practices in place."
[07:14] "But we still obviously want to learn about how to go about our new creative testing in this post-Andromeda world."
[07:22] "So, in that scenario, we essentially got it right immediately, right? There really was no creative testing that was necessary. We got instantly good feedback from the sales team. They liked the lead quality."
[07:36] "We had consistency in our cost per call and the total quantity of calls that we were able to produce. Again, there's no real issues there comparatively."
[07:48] "Now, the opposite can also be true, which is obviously you're going to need to creatively test in order to get things right in the instance that something on the front end is going wrong."

[08:52] "There's a great class. We literally just filmed it this last Tuesday. Every year, for all those who are unaware, still inside of this group, we have our master internet marketing class."
[09:05] "And our master internet marketing class is seven individual weeks of like 3 to five hour classes. They're extensive. This year in particular, I literally rebuilt the class from the entire ground up. Not a single slide was shared from the previous classes."

[09:30] "We had for week three specifically gone through Facebook and Instagram and obviously I had to talk about Meta and what I did in that class to like open the class for probably the first half of it was I explained how the algorithm works."
[09:48] "And I just talked about Andromeda as like one step of this algorithm and simply put the way that it works is essentially a two-step process. It's retrieval and then ranking."

[10:32] "So those two are directly correlated. Long story short, due to generative AI, there was so many more creatives than there's ever been before for that first retrieval step of the algorithm to sift through."
[10:48] "So they designed Andromeda so their initial retrieval step wouldn't fail. So they were required essentially to rebuild it. That's where Andromeda comes in."
[11:00] "All it does is sift through tens of millions, sometimes upwards of hundreds of millions of individual ads that are available in a given moment to target some users with and it whittled us all down to only a few thousand ads."

[11:36] "They've been using that since 2023. We'll talk about that here in a moment. Long story short, Andromeda, simply put, all you really got to understand is how does the retrieval process work when it's sifting through tens of millions of total creatives."
[11:54] "How specifically is it going about finding creatives to pull together and narrow down to those few thousand that it's going to hand off to the ranking system."

[12:10] "What we have found, just to be clear, is it's messaging. The words that you say, they matter so much more than damn near anything else."
[12:22] "I've been saying this for years since Facebook started introducing broad targeting as a major targeting component. Initially, I don't think broad targeting even by myself was necessarily understood to the extent of what it actually means nowadays."
[12:40] "You used to be able to just based on the word alone, broad targeting would make you think that you're literally just targeting like anybody and everybody and you're not actually getting in front of your ideal demographic, right?"
[12:54] "But what it actually means is, hey, leave your targeting open because we have officially designed a system that is damn near perfect at taking what you're talking about and what you're optimizing for and what a user wants and pairing those three together in damn near perfect unison."

[13:22] "So, a user's real time wants and needs, they are in real time by this platform known. What you're optimizing your campaign for is obviously known. This is as simple as literally picking the right standard event and campaign objective. Pixel conditioning best practices."
[13:42] "The other half of the equation, right, that other third, which is a huge part of it, is the ad itself. And the ad itself, I just want you to remember this. All it really means is what you say in the ads has everything to do with who that ad is probable to get in front of."
[14:02] "Especially when you first launch and you don't have any pixel data sending back to the results column. The messaging in the creative is what matters."

NÚMEROS: Não especificado

[14:50] "So, you guys have heard me talk extensively before about this concept called majority hooks. And majority hooks are pretty simple to understand. They're historically the ads that would get the most reach and appeal to the most people."
[15:08] "So, whatever people like a majority of the time, that's historically what would be you've got to talk about that frequently. And this in its history of the platform has been one of like the number one things that you'd want to figure out."
[15:26] "This mattered solely because we did not have this system that now exists. We didn't have Andromeda and Lattice working together in this retrieval ranking system to the level of perfection that it is now."
[15:42] "So, we had to influence it by trying to test hundreds and hundreds of creatives at high levels of spend to eventually and like pattern match ourselves which ones were doing the best and which ones were doing the worst."
[16:00] "And like slowly work our way through creative testing to the point where we found the ultimate holy grail of ad messaging, a majority hook."
[16:12] "The hook that we could say again and again and again and again and it would run for years, and it would appeal to the most people out of everybody that we were targeting and getting in front of."

[16:32] "Now, to be clear, is it still beneficial to find majority hooks? Yeah. But to be clear, does it have nearly as much influence as what it used to? No. And that's the most interesting part of this whole thing."
[16:48] "What we have found is these little minority hooks that we've previously kind of demonized to a degree as like stay away from minority hooks, you know, like don't try to talk to the smaller portions of your audiences because that's exactly what they are."
[17:06] "You know, they're the smaller portion of your audience and therefore it's not going to have as much appeal in comparison to talking to the larger part of your audiences and therefore you should, you know, try to cut those ads off and stay clear of them."
[17:22] "Well, now it's like the exact opposite is true. Now this half of the pie specifically, this actually matters way more than what it ever has before."
[17:35] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Why Minority Hooks Work Now"
NÚMEROS: Não especificado
VISUAL: Diagrama explicando o sistema de ranking Meta Lattice
[17:40] "And here's why. It's that ranking system. So the whole second half of the process after Andromeda goes and matches a bunch of individual creatives that are perfect for a specific user at a given time and highly probable to help you achieve your advertising outcome that you're optimizing for."
[18:00] "Andromeda hands it off to Lattice, which is the ranking part of the algorithm. This second half of the algorithm, it takes those couple thousand ads that it got and it literally just ranks them."
[18:15] "It ranks them on what's called the estimated action rate. So all the users that could be targeted by those couple thousand ads. It then just simply put puts a percentage. It's a prediction machine. Lattice is the prediction machine."

[18:38] "So what Lattice does that whole ranking system, super simple, it just puts a percentile probability to the creative, the advertiser's outcome that they're optimizing those campaigns for and that user's intent for what they likely want as a need or a want."
[19:00] "And whoever has the highest probability, whoever has the highest estimated action rate to pair with those creatives, that's who gets served those creatives, right?"
[19:12] "And so think about this. A majority hook technically appeals to the most people, right? A minority hook appeals specifically to an individual more than the majority. You understand?"

[19:35] "Like, let me just put this in perspective with a completely different context. When you hear anybody in your entire life ever talk about something political, it's usually like super broad topics like, 'Oh, we don't like abortion or like, oh, we want to, you know, kill drug dealers, you know, like give them all the death penalty.'"
[19:55] "You know, it's like these are super broad statements that if you individualize those statements, somebody might say something more along the lines of like, you know, I agree with abortion in this context and I disagree with it in these contexts."
[20:12] "The ad that would be probable to actually serve to that user nowadays would not be the ad that says abortion's bad, like we don't like abortion."
[20:22] "The ad that would get served to that person in this context would be we don't like abortion unless it's like this, right? But if it's like this, then we do like abortion. You see what I mean?"
[20:35] "That little like context minority hook is what this technology is capable of doing now. And that's why the minority hook matters so much more than it ever has before."

VISUAL: Gráfico mostrando distribuição desigual de alcance entre múltiplos criativos
[20:55] "Now, here's the interesting thing. The way that the distribution of creative has always been is still technically the same. If I load up a hundred creatives, I'm probable to only see a very small like maybe one to three creatives out of a hundred actually get like a majority of the reach."
[21:15] "But out of those few that we see get the reach, they're the minority hooks now instead of the majority hooks."
[21:24] "So that means when I go look in the algorithm, all right, and I look at the actual ads dashboard for like what the algorithm chose to distribute, I'm still going to see the same thing I always have."
[21:38] "There's going to be like one to three creatives that are just absolutely ripping and everything else is getting snuffed. But here's the thing. It's like throughout that entire duration of time, we're seeing a very consistent cost per result."

VISUAL: Comparação de ciclos de fadiga: minority hooks duram mais que majority hooks duravam antes
[22:02] "Historically, what would happen is like the exact opposite. A minority hook getting distribution in a very like this is the ad that gets the most reach kind of way. That used to be a terrible thing. That used to die extremely quick. It used to fatigue rapidly."
[22:22] "The majority hooks, those would be the ones that had the longest fatigue cycles, that could have legs the longest. Again, complete opposite."
[22:32] "Now, the minority hooks that are getting all the reach, they're lasting way longer than the majority hooks ever had previously."
[22:42] "So, again, if we go to the ad level of these campaigns, and we look at it and we break it down specifically for what creatives are getting the reach here. Look at reach specifically, because unfortunately, this is dynamic creative and it does that stupid glitch where you can't actually see the result."

[23:30] "So ad four so far has gotten relative reach in second place. We go to this ad set, ad 10, 21,000 people, ad 11. And the other ones have like single-digit or double-digit numbers. So pretty much no reach in this ad set."
[23:50] "Ad 10, right? And again, another random one. Ad five. Ad here got a little bit of reach, too. It came in third in this ad set. Here ad 14 got all the reach in the distribution."
[24:08] "Look at ad 10 in this ads set. Got 50 people reached. Didn't even serve it. Ad six, right? Which I don't even think we've seen as a number so far. Come in second place, right?"

[25:08] "And when we watch these creatives, like I just want you to be extremely clear. These are what I'm about to show you. These are all minority hooks. These are hooks that like historically would not have appealed to a wide range of people."

[46:42] "It's really up to you. I mean, honestly, either one can be a good answer. There's not really like a right or wrong that situation. I'd focus on using the same pixel and really just dial in more of the messaging to try to attract more of the right people."

[1:03:05] "But a lot of them, to be fair, they will actually film 50. So, anyway, it depends on who it is. Either way, we typically launch with 25 to 30 unique ads."

[1:33:25] "I want to be very fair in saying what I've covered here with you is perfect for what you specifically need to know and I pulled out a majority of the stuff that I could just otherwise explain in much further detail here in order to make it efficient for you to be able to consume."
[1:33:48] "So if you do want more extended training on this, the week three fifth cohort master internet marketing class would be where you'd want to go. It's inside of all your training modules. Just navigate to week three of the master internet marketing class and you'll see the fifth cohort recording. Watch that."

[1:34:15] "All right, cool. Follow Jeremy. Yeah, sure. What do you got? Hello. Sorry. Last question. Just so I did watch your week three cohort."
[1:34:32] "You talked about pixeling. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Okay, perfect. So you talked about pixeling. I was just a little I guess I didn't know which way to go."
[1:34:48] "You mentioned conversion API. You mentioned the pixeling on the website. So, my situation is, you know, I want to be able to pixel people for like a six figure income based on the survey, but I also like the idea of the closer."
[1:35:12] "My question is, should I do either or or maybe combine them a little bit of a both where we get those people, but then the closer based on what they think of them, they could also put them through go high level or act them a certain way through conversion API."

[1:35:42] "We just always tell you to set up both, Vlad, just like I said in that class. Don't over complicate it. Just set up the web pixel. Set up the conversion API. Make sure you dupe it."
[1:35:58] "Long story short, if you're getting the right people through, you got no issues. If you're getting unqualified people to fill out your applications and they're lying and saying they're qualified, then stop using the web pixel and just use the conversion API and fire off the people who are qualified. Does that make sense?"
[1:36:22] "Okay. And it doesn't Yeah. I guess my concern was only the amount of people coming in. So, as a closer, it's going to be less people obviously, but from what you're saying, it's dynamic anyway. So, you're saying..."
[1:36:45] "I don't know why you're saying it's going to be less people. What are you talking about?"
[1:36:52] "So, if if you do it through the survey, there's going to be a certain amount of people coming in, but then if the closer now gets those people, it's going to be way less people. They're going to be more picky with it who they're going to put through the conversion API."

VISUAL: Esclarecimento sobre volume de leads vs volume de dados para pixel
[1:37:22] "No, I think you're I think you're wildly misunderstanding what that means. So, long story short, let's just the simplest way I can articulate it to you. You ready? Yeah. You have an application call funnel. Yep."
[1:37:42] "People fill out the application. If you are getting people that tell the truth that they're qualified, then you can use the web pixel to send that data back to Facebook. Okay. You with me? Yep. Yeah. Yeah."
[1:38:02] "Now, let's say people lie and they're not qualified, but they're saying they are. If we send those people back to the pixel, it's going to hit the results column and go after more unqualified people who lie."
[1:38:22] "Therefore, I would not want to use the web pixel. I would want to use the conversion API because through the conversion API I can choose who I send back to the pixel. Does that make sense?"
[1:38:42] "Yeah, that makes sense. I get so my question was if we get to choose now because I'm not running a, you know, $10,000 a day. It's going to be less people because we're choosing them. No. No. No. Okay. No. Okay. No."

VISUAL: Esclarecimento final sobre volume vs qualidade de dados
[1:39:12] "It doesn't matter. Just do it now. Here we go. You ready? Here you go. You ready? Yeah. So from that specific point that you're trying to make, the pixel sees less people. Correct. That's the only thing sees less people. The same amount of people are going to come through."
[1:39:38] "Yeah. No, that's what I was saying. The pixel will see less people. Is that okay that it's a less quantity of people for the pixel? Will it still condition just as fast?"
[1:39:55] "Correct. So the way you framed it, just to be clear, is you said my closer is going to see less people. My apologies. I didn't mean that. The closer are going to see the same amount of people. The pixel is going to see less people, but it's going to be the right people, which is correct condition."
[1:40:18] "So, at the very beginning of the pixel conditioning cycle, even though it might see less people, that's still better than seeing a bunch of the wrong people, right? Okay. That was my question. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. I misspoke. I apologize."
[1:40:38] "Oh, it's okay, man. I'm just I'm not trying to talk to you like you're a you know? I'm just trying to slow it down to make sure you understand."
[1:40:52] "So, moral of the story is, yeah, your closer is going to see the same amount of people. The pixel is going to see a little bit of the less people when you fire it off through the conversion API."
[1:41:08] "That's called a delayed firing event because again, you're going to have however much time it takes to determine if someone's qualified or not before you fire it back."
[1:41:22] "And yeah, the more people you send back, the better. But to be clear, still only sending the right people back is still a good best practice rather than just sending a bunch of donkeys at it. You know what I mean?"
[1:41:38] "Yep. Perfect. Okay, I'm totally clear. Thank you, Jim. Cool. Okay, man."

[1:42:15] "Would you set up like a new pixel and new events for that new market?"
[1:42:22] "Yeah. So, are you intending to use the same standard event for whatever that new market is?"
[1:42:32] "So, we have that was the that was the idea. So, we have a it's like through Hyros. It's a qualified call. We base it off of the survey question, send it back via the conversion API."
[1:42:52] "So, long story short, as we go after like financial advisors, I was thinking about doing a different pixel."

[1:43:08] "Super simple answer, yes or no. Is it the same standard event that you would optimize for in the campaign? Yes. Okay. Different pixel."
[1:43:22] "If it's a different demographic and you're going to use the same standard event, don't mix the two. Just use a different pixel for that use case. Got it. Cool. Makes sense. Does that make sense? Why?"
[1:43:42] "Yeah. because you would basically muddy the data. It would just get confused. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. That's really all it is."
[1:43:58] "Would it I'm just thinking in terms of like complexity. Would it make more sense to just use a different standard event on the same pixel or is it the same thing you..."
[1:44:15] "No, it's not. What you're saying is not complex at all. It's just spinning up a new pixel. That's why they allow you to create more than one pixel in an account, you know?"
[1:44:32] "So, if you wanted to use the same pixel and you wanted to use a different standard event, like yeah, you could, but keep in mind like if that other standard event you're going to pick isn't what you actually want, then just create a new pixel and use the actual standard event you want. Does that make sense?"
[1:44:55] "Got it. Yeah, it makes sense. So, just it could just be optimized for schedule or whatever and then we wouldn't even have to have like a custom event like qualified call. Yeah, that's exactly right. Cool. Makes sense."

[1:45:22] "Charles says, 'When you muddy the pixel with low-quality people, make new pixel or retrain existing?' Either one, Charles. I mean, honestly, you could do both."
[1:45:38] "There's really not like a right or wrong answer there. You can go through the recondition. I mean, to be rather direct, like it's pretty much the same in either scenario. That's why I say it doesn't really matter."
[1:45:55] "If you retrain a pixel, it's pretty much the same exact process as training a new pixel, you know? So at least with your existing pixel, it might have like somewhat of an idea of who to go after."
[1:46:12] "With a new pixel, the benefit of the new pixel in that scenario is it would rely more on the messaging of your creatives and your outcome you're optimizing for rather than the pixel data."
[1:46:32] "So if you believe that the pixel data on the old one is ruining your probability of reaching the right people faster, then yeah, a new pixel can be great because it removes the pixel conditioning aspect of who it goes after and it solely relies on the messaging and what you're optimizing for. So, it can be good."
[1:46:58] "One or the other. Again, it's just more of like a situational thing for what you're going to pick and how fast you want to get through it."

ESTRATÉGIAS E SISTEMAS:
Meta Andromeda:
Sistema de 2 etapas: Retrieval (Andromeda) + Ranking (Meta Lattice)
Andromeda filtra dezenas/centenas de milhões de anúncios → poucos milhares
Meta Lattice (desde 2023) ranqueia por estimated action rate
Apenas MESSAGING importa (não themes ou visuals)
Minority hooks agora performam melhor que majority hooks
Mensagens contextualizadas específicas > mensagens amplas
Creatives completamente únicos requeridos (não apenas variações de hook)
Processo de Criação:
Usar Manis AI em modo agente para gerar 50 scripts únicos
Upload de exemplos de ads + Creative Diversification SOP
Formato Hook-Body-CTA mantido em ~1 minuto
Teleprompter standard para eficiência
Mesma roupa, mesmo local, mesma expressão = OK
Apenas o que é DITO precisa mudar drasticamente
Ads tipo "objection handler" performam excepcionalmente
Estrutura de Campanha:
2 campanhas: 1 Warm + 1 Cold
Warm: 1 ad set com audience stack (365d engagement, 15s+ video views, 180d website, 90d leads)
Cold: 3 ad sets (Broad, Interest Stack, Lookalike Stack) ou 2 para special ad categories
ABO preferido atualmente sobre CBO
25-30 (ou 50) anúncios individuais por ad set
Mesmos anúncios em todos os ad sets
5 headlines + 5 body copies dinâmicos (mesmo texto em todos os vídeos)
Excluir conversões e customers de todos os ad sets
Gestão de Fadiga:
Fadiga = volume decline + cost increase por 72h sustentadas
Step 1: Duplicar ad set (ABO) ou campanha (CBO)
Step 2: Remover 1-3 ads que receberam alcance, manter 22-25 sem alcance
If/Then: Se resultados voltam ao normal = sucesso, se não = pull todos os criativos
Step 3 (se necessário): Lançar com criativos completamente novos
50% de sucesso apenas com rotação dos criativos não distribuídos
Ciclos de fadiga muito mais longos (2-3 meses vs múltiplos por mês)
Pixel Conditioning:
Setup dual: Web pixel + Conversion API sempre
Se leads mentem/não qualificam: usar apenas Conversion API
Withholding data strategy para reorientar algoritmo
Delayed firing events para qualificação pelo closer
Pixel vê menos pessoas mas pessoas CERTAS
Diferentes demographics = diferentes pixels (mesmo standard event)
Recency bias: dados recentes importam mais
Messaging triunfa sobre pixel conditioning em novos launches
Advantage Creative Toggles:
Workaround: Advertiser Settings → Advantage Creative → Desabilitar todos
Permitir dynamic ads novamente em algumas contas
Individual ads preferidos devido a toggles e reporting glitch
ESTRUTURA:
Hierarquia de Importância Andromeda:
Messaging (CRÍTICO)
Campaign optimization/standard event
User's real-time intent
Themes (não importa)
Visuals (não importa)
Framework de Teste Criativo:
Problema de atração = problema de mensagem
Front-end = scanner mode (venda rápida nos ads)
Back-end = consumption mode (VSSL/podcast longo OK)
Testar até achar mensagens que atraem pessoas certas
Depois: manter veia de mensagem, adicionar variações
Feed Manis com "funciona" e "não funciona" para próximas iterações
Distribuição de Alcance:
1-3 criativos recebem maioria do alcance (sempre foi assim)
Agora são minority hooks específicos (não majority hooks)
22-25 criativos não recebem alcance (reservoir para fadiga)
Custo por resultado permanece consistente mesmo com distribuição desigual
Não se preocupar com alcance desigual se resultados são bons
Recursos de Treinamento:
Ad Diversification Mastery SOP
Weekly group calls sobre Andromeda
Master Internet Marketing Class (7 semanas, 3-5h cada)
Week 3 Fifth Cohort recording (4h detalhada sobre Andromeda)
Pixel Conditioning video na biblioteca
Scripts de exemplo: Andrew Lamb 15 ads, J 50 ads
DADOS FINANCEIROS:
Investimento: $500K-$1.5M por cliente/mês
ROI: 4x+ ROAS consistente
Custo por aquisição: $56.54-$65 por call qualificada
Volume: 673-931 calls por mês por cliente
Redução de custos: Custos mais baixos historicamente com Andromeda
Eficiência: Menos relançamentos necessários (economia de produção)
Comparativo: Antes = múltiplos relançamentos/mês, Agora = 2-3 meses sem mudanças
DURAÇÃO: 1h47min FORMATO: Treinamento ao vivo com demonstrações de tela, análise de contas reais, Q&A interativo
