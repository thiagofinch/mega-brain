Transcrição Completa: 59 Million Dollar Month Brainwashing Training 1 11 25     [00:00] "All right, so welcome in. Uh, today we got a request from Shane. He was talking about some brainwashing tactics for million-dollar months. And as silly as that might sound to some of you guys, it is a hyper valuable set of lessons uh to go through like the mental stance that you must have to achieve something that .1% of all people on earth as business owners achieve."   [00:30] "It's actually statistically smaller than that. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics, they say that .1% of businesses achieve $10 million a year. So obviously if you hit a million dollars a month for 12 months in a row, that's 12 million. So that actually diminishes that probability to an even lower number."   [01:00] "Without further ado, let's jump into the training. Um, if you're doing a couple hundred grand a month, I think this is the most important for you. And if you're at a million a month and you're stuck and you're having trouble getting to that next million dollars a month, I think this is also going to be, you know, quite impactful for you."

I am always a big fan of thinking big but feeling small. And I really think that this is where it all starts. When you look at current revenue, we want to in our brain think as though we can achieve like 5 million a month, 10 million a month, like far greater numbers than what the actual number is that we want to accomplish. But at the same time, we have to feel small."   [02:45] "So, take somebody like Elon. Let's look at Elon's psyche real quick and really just break down what this guy thinks and why it's so beneficial. Who here thinks - Put in the chat. Just put a one if you think Elon Musk thinks big."   [03:15] "Now, here's the thing. Who here thinks that Elon feels small? Put a one in the chat if you think that while he thinks big, he feels small at the same time."

Well, where are we today? Are we a multiplanetary species? It's like, no. How does Elon think? It's like, well, why does a man like that come along and just all of a sudden overnight dramatically increase the probability that we're actually going to be not only visiting Mars, but like quite literally populating and creating civilization on a whole another planet like Mars?"   [04:30] "It's because he's not just thinking with Mars. He's thinking with, 'Dude, we're in like a small fucking solar system, a part of the Milky Way, which is a part of like who fucking knows how big of a universe, supposedly endless.' He has visibility into things that you and I can look up through public telescopes if we really wanted to understand and see it for ourselves."

Like, we're like a speck of dust in a giant universe that we exist in. And you're telling me we can't get like what, one planet over in the same fucking solar system we're in right now?"   [06:00] "Can you see right away just how right away that would enable you to make going to Mars and populating Mars and running a civilization on Mars extremely probable to accomplish if you hold this psyche of like we should be well beyond that."   [06:30] "He has this series of books that he likes by Isaac Asimov and it's like this seven book series, it's like a sci-fi book series and I mean it ties in a lot of great like energy principles as well for where species can be at relative to their ability to like harness energy in different ways."   [07:00] "He probably thinks that the next set of planets that we are going to populate are going to be like moons that orbit around Jupiter or fucking Saturn or something like that, you know, other habitable areas within our existing solar system. And because of that level of thinking, all of the stuff that's fucking massive, insanely hard for little puny ant brains to consider doing, he looks at as, oh, this should be super easy to accomplish."

Now, let's tie in this simulation theory thought process. Why do you think it'd be beneficial for Elon to think to himself and deeply believe that we're in a simulation?"   [08:30] "To get results in the future, you have to live in the future. Did some hippie belief come up inside of you when I said that that tells you to live in the present instead? Is there some random hippie belief you don't even know where it comes from that you've heard through hearsay that tells you it's best to live in the now?"

One of the specific types of worker that Elon employs are physicists who build gaming engines. The reason that Elon is able to get rockets to land themselves is because of physicists who work on video game engines."   [09:45] "He's figured out life is math. Every single thing is quantifiable. There's a number in the eyes of this man. And the people who build video game engines, who work on physics in video game engines. He was like, 'Well, why wouldn't we just model the numbers and the physics of what we experience in real life and run simulations about how a rocket could land itself.'"   [10:30] "Instead of just blindly building fucking rocket ships and seeing if they could then land themselves, what did he do first? He ran simulations. He ran a fuckload of simulations with physicists who modeled base reality and said, 'Okay, what would it take for a rocket to land itself?' They saw what it would take and then they built the fucking rocket."   [11:00] "How many times did they fail landing a rocket before they actually got it to land itself? They failed twice. How do you think that they failed twice to land a fucking rocket ship, which nobody else had done in history, and then they successfully landed that shit nine times in a row after? Because they simulated it."

Do you think that with a $1,500 per month test budget that this client could be successful? Put a Y if you agree. Put a N if you disagree."   [13:30] "Most of you here, you're obviously throwing N's in the chat. I don't see one why. Now, let me just ask you a simple question. Does that come from financially modeling out the answer or does that come from experience that you just know as experienced advertisers or from hearsay that that's too low of a budget? You're also just guessing just like Brad's guessing. You just guessed as well. You didn't actually do any math for whether it's probable to work or not."

That's all it ever comes down to because that reveals everything. It reveals every single fucking thing for whether it's probable to work or not, what the statistics need to be at in order to continue doing it and actually getting money on the other side.

James just hit a million dollars a month in December. He had two months in Q4 as well where he hit like 952K and 948K and they fucking whiffed a million dollars a month twice. Then finally in December, not only did they hit it, they exceeded it. They hit like 1.18."   [16:00] "When they hit it and they exceeded it, do you think we only did the math one time? We did the math every fucking week. We went into the financial model every single week and we would update the statistics in real time to see if we were on pace or not for hitting the numbers."   [16:30] "If they spent 500 grand, had a 370 cost per call, they do a two call close model, 54% show rate for the first call, a 58% booking rate for the second call, a 73% show rate for the second call, they close at 42%. This is what they cash collect on average per sale. Spend 500, make 1.557. Easy enough."   [17:00] "Every single week, we go in and we update the financial model and we say, 'Okay, what's current cost per call at? What's our current this? What's our current that?' and we can see the future. You guys ever see the movies with the crystal balls and they fucking look at the crystal ball and they can tell the future?

Their cost per call in fucking Q4 was running upwards of like $600. Look at the difference in what that does if they ran a $600 cost per call. And if people competed with Santa Claus, if that went down from $12,000 to 10,000 for their average cash collected per sale, dude, they're barely clearing a 1.6 ROAS with just those two differences in numbers."   [18:45] "What did we do? We didn't just get fucked on. I told him, I said, 'You're going to take all your attention. You're going to focus it on the back end. We're going to take a lot of our attention. We're going to focus it on maximizing show rate.' The show rate through Q4 for them was like close to 70%.

You don't look at the price of anything anymore."   [21:30] "You're flying first class. You're never even going to see economy again. You know, maybe you're even on a PJ here and there.

And while I pull out of my garage a fucking $950,000 SVJ Roadster can pull in front of me. And then when we both pull out of the garage, he can look to his left and see a fucking $3 million Bugatti Pure Sport Chiron. And that guy can fucking go drive around with like five other people who own those cars around here."   [23:15] "And then those guys, they see a fucking $6 million Koenigsegg and they feel tiny.

First of all, they never do fucking math. Second of all, they act like they're big shit popping."

I talked about this quite frequently over the years where we have to look at all kinds of stuff that makes a measly $12 million a year seem like fucking nothing."

This is one of the most critical lessons to this combination of variables here, is we have to be able to figure out what we can consistently look at.

The most expensive watch I bought so far was $108,000. And when I bought the $108,000 watch, didn't feel big at all. Felt very realistic. And that was during a month where I did like high couple hundred grand. It was pretty close to a million that month. So I know that like maybe even a 230K watch - I mean you probably still need to be around a million a month to make that like really comfortable."   [30:30] "Now this is a $3 million car right here on the left. This is a Daytona SP3. Now I don't just look at that on Instagram. I have a nice little model of that car right here.

What am I doing wrong in business that makes a $3 million car expensive? And I want to see it all the fucking time. So those thoughts consistently come across my head and just make me reconsider the math, reconsider what I'm doing."   [32:00] "Do you think you're buying a $3 million car when you make $12 million a year gross? You're not buying a $3 million car with $12 million on gross. Because like realistically, what are you going to net when you do $6 million? $12 million, you're probably spending like three to five million at least on ads and on marketing and on sales people and on staff.

If you do a million dollars a month, could you accumulate a million dollars in cash pretty easily? Yeah.
