23. CROSplit Testing Lessons For Call Funnels 7-19-25.mp4 All right, welcome in everybody. So today we had a request from Sam. Sam asked specifically. Like when and how and what do you specifically change on call funnels when they're not working or just when you want to split test them in general. So we're going to be going through that here today. For starters, for all those who don't know or are newer to the group, we have an entire video on what we call call funnel mastery. Inside of that specific lesson. I referenced several other lessons that are very important to understand about call funnels in general, just for the best practices. I'll go through a few of those here lightly, just so we're on the same page about how I typically launch call funnels. And then, from there, we'll determine, like, some key KPIs and what they should realistically be. And then we'll dive into specific CRO best practices. So, when I say call funnel, I typically start every call funnel the exact same way. That way I have a constant. As you guys know, I'm a big fan of constants and variables in marketing as you guys all should as well. We typically launch with damn near the same tech stack every single time. That way we know, based on the average benchmarks and KPIs that we experience inside of all these other businesses. Whether we should or should not be experiencing that same thing inside of another business, based on keeping the page a constant, is the question. So it's not necessarily a template, but again, in terms of of like similar formats, it is. We don't do the exact same VSLs. You know, we don't ask the exact same questions inside of every application. We don't use the exact same headline inside of every single one of these VSL call funnels. But these three components are typically our constants. Okay, so long story short. Typically, in terms of the tech stack, as most of you know, I'm not biased towards this. This is just what generally gets the best cost per call currently. And that's Typeform and Calendly. A lot of people try to justify, like, 'I use GoHighLevel or I use HubSpot or whatever other fucking tool out there exists.' Some people just recently— are using a software called iClosed, just to give a shout out to the guys using that. Simply put, all I give a fuck about. I don't give a shit if it's Typeform or Calendly, literally all I care about is that my application and my calendar are integrated with each other. That's what I care about. What I do not want is—this, where I have my headline. My VSL, I do not want to put a button here. It's okay to sometimes have a button. We'll talk about that here soon enough. But the main thing that I always do is I want the application here on the page itself. What I do not want, okay, I do not want the scheduler on the following step. Followed by the confirmation page. Okay, I do not want that. This typically gets a 50% drop off. Between these two steps here. So as a result of having that 50% drop, I typically simply put experience about twice the cost per call that I otherwise should be if I just had those two things integrated. So long story short, I reiterate this lesson all the time. I do not want this. I always want to have something and I don't care. I genuinely don't care. I know that I talk about it at a very high frequency, but long story short, Typeform and Calendly currently get about a 16% average drop off. That's typically what we see when we look at drop-off percentages. So long story short, that typically results in a lot lower cost per qualified call simply from leveraging that tech stack. So one of the easiest things that you could do— just to drive down your cost per qualified call right away, again, regardless of whatever the specific software stack is that you specifically have doing this— okay? Typeform and Calendly typically do the best. One of the other big reasons that I like Typeform, and I know that there's plenty of other software for applications specifically that do this, is they reveal the questions question by question. Okay. One of the worst things you could typically do on a call funnel is have it to where all of the questions are just exposed. So, as an example, like sometimes people will leverage Calendly by itself because, to be fair to Calendly, like Calendly technically has a function called workflows. And they also leverage conditional logic inside of Calendly, but all the questions are exposed. And that can also typically lower the overall quantity of people that have willingness to fill out the application in general. So, as an example, GoHighLevel, the ultimate copycat software, Typeform, obviously, JotForm does this as well. And I'm sure, just to be clear, there's a gazillion smaller application software that do this too. You want it to be question by question. So, if you want examples of this, go to any singular one of my funnels. They all look like this. Long story short. Typeform and Calendly, with the integration of the scheduler step, okay? Key thing, and then pick a Typeform-like software. Or type form directly, that would just reveal question by question as those answers get done. We've typically, again, time and time again, in modern times and in old times. It's consistent throughout the years. It holds true. When we have one of those softwares that just shows every single question at once, we see a lot lower application rate. Now, typically in terms of... a KPI that you want to be aware of. From the click to the actual Call a qualified call. Being booked. We typically see about a 3% to 5% overall conversion rate. It's about the average from click to qualified call. Okay. Have we seen more than that? Yeah, absolutely. Typically, when we do see more than that, it, believe it or not, has less to do with what we functionally achieve on the page. It has a lot more to do with offers and really warmed up traffic to those offers. So if we target a demographic, keep in mind. There's a lot of people. That will think you can influence conversion rate exclusively based on what you do on the page. And obviously that's true, right? Yeah, you can absolutely increase or decrease your overall conversion rate based on how the page looks and the assets that are on the page. But it's also very important to note traffic and like the quality of traffic and how the traffic is framed going to the page. That also wildly dictates this specific statistic. Okay, so moral of the story you have to make sure that you understand. You are in a position where 3% to 5% should be the average conversion rate. And sometimes the main thing I want to point out, regardless of what you do on the page, if you're not really seeing any movement in that statistic, consider taking your attention off the page. Consider taking your attention to the actual ad creatives themselves and the traffic that you are driving to that page. Because, as an example, as we all know, if we drive traffic to a page with a traffic campaign optimized for link clicks or landing page views, we're going to have fucking tens of thousands of people click through to the page. We're going to have a dog shit conversion rate. Right. If I optimize, like, sometimes the standard event that you select inside of a conversion optimized campaign can also wildly dictate conversion rates, like I've seen some guys come into this very group that they're optimizing for a qualified scheduled call, but they're using the standard event of lead as an example. And I'm not. saying that that can't be profitable or that I haven't seen it work. I definitely have. But lead, as an example of a standard event, is typically a more surface-level standard event to pick. It typically is more indicative of an opt-in. Okay, so therefore, it's more shallow and surface-level comparatively to a deeper, down the funnel standard event that you could have otherwise picked. So, typically, in terms of the standard events that we like, we typically optimize on that confirmation page for schedule. Sometimes we will also split test complete registration. And I know this might sound a little counterintuitive just based on the words that it says, but submit application. Can also be good for qualified booked calls. And in terms of the standard events, I want to be fair in saying this, it can still be profitable. This can still be a scaling tactic, believe it or not, that you can pull out of the hat if you want to. But lead, as a standard event, when optimizing for a qualified scheduled call, again, just typically brings in a lower quality of traffic. Not terrible. Again, seen it very profitable just to openly disclose. But as an example, like we had somebody optimizing for lead recently and we encouraged them, 'Hey, why not duplicate out the campaigns? Optimize those newly duped out campaigns for schedule.' Throw that schedule standard event onto the confirmation page for the qualified booked calls. See what that gets for a qualified book call comparatively, and see if there's a difference in lead quality. Dude, the guy immediately reports. It back days later, he was like, 'Dude, my cost per call dropped by about 40 bucks.' And I also saw a much higher intent lead come through, right? So it's like, when you look at this conversion rate right here, this is very important to note, right? You can wildly influence the conversion rate solely based on traffic. And what you optimize for is the point I'm attempting to make. Okay. So sometimes, rather than immediately changing your page, you realistically and potentially also want to look at the traffic, right? And what you're optimizing for, and like, what the messaging is. Another key example that I just want to point out, prior to continuing here. I run this split test quite frequently, especially on newer accounts and on accounts that we've had for long periods of time. We typically pull this out of the hat occasionally to see if it still holds true. Images typically drive a more curious individual to the page, right? Versus a video can drive somebody to the page who's damn near already sold on filling out the application. So, if we do a good enough job with our video creatives and the copy that's paired with that on the ad itself, we'll typically see some very interesting statistics on the page. Okay, so let me give you a few examples of these. Number one, we'll see lower play rates when we've done a phenomenal job with video ads that drive to the page. But we'll still see a higher conversion rate on the page as a result of this. And so that can kind of be contradicting because you might think to yourself, 'Well, for my VSL call funnel page that has three fucking things on it— a headline, a VSL, and an application— you're probably thinking to yourself that you would want a high play rate. And that you would want a high engagement rate. Play rate represents the quantity of people that hit the page and press play. Engagement rate is the average length of the video that somebody consumes. So if you had a 30% engagement rate as an example, on average, somebody consumed 30% of your video, not necessarily in the... from playing it to 30% in just like a random 30% on average. Anyway, I digress. A great example of this, just to give you like a personal example, I always talk about how much I pay in taxes. I'll give you another great one just up that same alley. I get targeted by tax strategists all the time as a result of me just talking about taxes around on my fucking devices all the time. Um, anyway. The moral of the story is there was a video ad from a guy who essentially the messaging was something like this. It was, 'Hey man, you're a rich guy now. You know, you're a rich guy.' CPAs. tax attorneys, they're not actually optimizing lowering your overall tax burden. Your bookkeeper, that's all they do. They just fucking get your books up to date. Your CPA, all they do is file your taxes. They don't give a fuck how much you pay. They don't give a fuck if you pay less. What are they, like a couple grand a year? Your tax attorney, you tip. Higher to go fight the IRS if they hit you up with some letter or some shit that gives you some kind of demand that you owe more money. You know what I mean? I was like, you need a tax strategist. A tax strategist, that's somebody who's going to lower your overall tax burden legally. They're going to lower the overall amount that you owe legally. Through a bunch of different tax deduction strategies that your current CPA bookkeeper and tax attorney don't give a damn about. Now, I saw that ad video. I watched damn near the entire part of the ad video. I went to the guy's page and I was ready to go. Like I didn't need to watch his VSL. You get what I'm saying? Like there was nothing else that the guy could have said that would have sold me more. I was already prepared to convert. Right and so, some of you guys, you'll withhold the application from showing until a certain amount of time has passed when you're on the page. If you do your video ads good enough and you drive quality traffic with high intent to your page, you're actually losing that demographic by withholding the application from showing until a certain amount of time passes because you're sold that a person needs to consume the VSL prior to converting. Right? That's very important to note. Okay, very important to note. So comparatively, like that particular guy, that's exactly what he did. That's why I pointed out. I clicked to the page. I was fucking ready to convert and there was nothing to convert on. The application wasn't there. So I just left. You know, I'm not fucking waiting around a couple minutes. I'm cold traffic. I don't give a fuck about who you are. You know how many ads like that I get targeted by, especially after I clicked on that one guy's ad? I made a whole fucking YouTube video about it, talking about the algorithm update, because literally after I clicked away from that ad and didn't convert, every single subsequent ad for like a fucking mile of the newsfeed was tax strategists with the exact same messaging. You see? So anyway, my point is, is like, I'm not a fan of withholding the application until a certain amount of time passes. Okay. Just to point that out on a total side note, I obviously believe in backend selling systems. And I believe that getting the person to convert for a. a good cost, right? A cost that we agree is favorable to our numbers. and then focusing on backend selling systems. Confirmation page breakout videos. Breakout, excuse me, the value-dense email sequences. Hammer them, strategy. Salespeople doing the manual follow-up and the setter best practices. I can still get a lot of the information that a lot of people are trying to shill off inside of a VSL after I get the person to convert. So the main thing I care about on a call— funnel specifically— is getting a qualified booked call to convert. That's what I give a fuck about. I don't care if they consume the entire BSL. I have my backend selling systems to get them all that information. So anyway, back to the point I'm attempting to make before I went off in that little side tangent there. Videos, simply put, can typically drive a more qualified, higher intent, higher interest individual to the page. OK, images comparatively. They'll typically get more reach. And they'll typically, in most instances, have a slightly cheaper cost to get that reach. Okay, but. They typically can drive a lower intent lead to the page, like a more curious lead, somebody who has a lower interest level. And then your page obviously is going to do a lot more. more of the selling to get the individual to convert. So, if I use a lot of image ads, my statistics are going to be completely different than if I use a lot of video ads. Okay. If I use a lot of video ads, I can generally expect a lower play rate on the video itself. Right. So, on this video, I can get a lower play rate and still have a great conversion rate because I used videos that did a good job selling people. OK, like a good example of this, I've pointed this out to you guys recently with the Andrew Lamb video that I posted inside Telegram. I showed you guys all of this for exactly how I broke down this campaign. Okay, I showed you everything. And. Let's see. Uh... Let's go search the word. Buh-bye. Yeah, here we go. Let's see if I posted the rest of it here. Excuse me. Anyway, somewhere in here I posted all these, maybe we can find it under the media tab based on all these videos I uploaded. Doo-doo. Thank you. Excuse me, everybody. I think this is a great example, by the way. I think it's very important to find and point out, but I don't know if they're loaded in here. I haven't opened Telegram on here in a while. Anyway, I posted the Andrew Lamb. And on that Andrew Lam case study video specifically, I talked about all of the details relating to the ads and the page. And now, his video, the point I was attempting to make on his specific page, was his video is not necessarily a traditional VSL. OK, his video specifically was a podcast and a podcast was just shy of an hour in length. Okay, the podcast was upwards of an hour long, it was like 57 or 58 minutes. And on that specific page, it's like, as you can imagine, the consumption rate of an hour long video is arguably not that good. You know, it's just it's just not going to have that high a consumption rate. Okay, it's an hour long. But the videos that I drove the people to this page with. Grid, what is going on? That's what gets the people to convert. You see, and like I posted all of this inside of the chat here. So you guys could all see it in real time and like literally look at it. So I posted about. The cost per result and by the way, this cost per result is still holding true. We're seeing about a $50 cost per conversion inside of this account, right? And we spent about $25,000 so far on this. Maybe a little less than that. And I'm seeing conversions across all the different, these specific results, these come from warm, which is a warm audience stack, a broad stack, an interest stack, and then a lookalike audience stack. Okay, so that's what each one of those ad sets are. And as you can see here, like they're all converting relatively the same. I think warm is like a little cheaper right now. And so it's broad, broad's doing pretty well. I also posted, you know, okay, I just loaded 10 different videos into Dynamic Creative. I loaded five different copy variations into the body copy. And then I posted the link here as well. If you want to find this, you can just click up here and then click on media and then just scroll down until you see it. There's 10 different videos and they all look like this. This is Andrew. He's an Inner Circle member and a client. Okay, then I posted everything about how I set up the campaign. Now, the point I'm trying to emphasize, right, is if you watch these videos, this proves the point I'm attempting to make very directly. Comparatively, if I drove somebody to the page with image ads. Again, I am realistically with that hour-long video. I'm not going to get a lot of consumption on it because it's so long. And if I did, I'm still very probable to get a good high intent individual to convert. But it's very important to note, like what you do on the page is very relative to the audience that you drive to it and the intent of the audience that you drive to it. So again, really simple. Shorter videos. That are very direct. They work great with rich people. Okay. Shorter videos, like think like two to 10-minute VSLs, as an example, typically work best for cold audiences as well. So cold audiences, whether they're rich or the general public, I have to bias towards a shorter BSL. If I have a rich demographic I'm selling to, I'm every single time going to bias towards a shorter video as well. But at the same time, okay, I could follow. A page like this that has this hour-long video on it because, arguably, when the ads do a great enough job at selling people, those people are going to convert anyway. Right. And the people who are more skeptical, I can leave them an asset like this for that person to consume. Okay, now one of the key things that I want to point out on damn near every single VSL that we ever produce, few things. Number one, we want there to be those little chapters at the bottom that you see here. Okay, just to zoom in a little bit, we want these little chapters at the bottom of every video. Okay. The illusion of a BSL call funnel is that somebody's going to consume all of it. Just to be very direct with you, you're fucking retard if you think that, okay? That's not how it works. How it actually works is that people are going to skip around relative to what they think is appropriate for them. Like as a great example of this, this whole first 10 minutes is Andrew's background. Maybe somebody doesn't care about that at all because they don't care about Andrew yet. Maybe they realistically just care about sober living homes. Right? And like, what specific questions they might have about sober living homes. And they could consume this video at a high rate. But I need to make sure those chapters are at the bottom for them to be able to jump around to get the information that that person specifically wants to know. Now, on this page in particular, I just want to point out. This video, because an hour long, has a pretty low play rate. Okay, and if you look at the rest of the page, it's like, this is it, right? They have a button to the application here. And I can't stress enough. This is very important to understand this. This was a page that was already built by Andrew and his team prior to me coming into the account. I wanted to create a variable of the ads. I wanted to leave the page as a constant. Now, just relative to the current cost per qualified call that we're getting, relative to the fact that. Quality is very warm and people are very. uh, giving very positive feedback simply put about the quality of the leads. I just want to point out, in this case, I'm not going to touch this page. I'm not going to do anything to it because it's already working. As soon as I start seeing a higher cost per call, the first action I'm going to take is exactly what I tell you guys. I'm going to embed that application straight onto the page rather than having it be how it currently is now, where there's a button on the page. But there are a lot of instances where buttons can make sense. So, if you want or have a software that you're struggling with, because some of you, again, like, regardless of how many times I say it, with the fact that I love Typeform and Calendly and the effectiveness of it and it typically gets the best cost per qualified call, some of you still use other software. And some of you don't get to see the question-by-question drop off that occurs inside of applications. Okay. So, when you embed the applications straight on to the page itself and you do use Typeform, you get to see the quantity of people that started the application and you get to see the question-by-question drop off. Now, although yes, again, Plenty of other softwares have that. I'm just talking to the specific individuals on this call and who watch this call that for some reason don't pay for a software that does that. In that case, it does make more sense to have a button because then you can see how many people went from page one to the application page. You understand? And that can help with tracking. Sometimes, I just want to be fair— it's also like a very, very, very like scaled action you can take when you start taking actions like cyclic campaigns, horizontal funnel scaling. An additional action you can take when you are running cyclic campaigns, very, very high up the funnel action is to optimize for that button press. Tut. Signal to the custom conversion, this is an individual who showed intent to fill out the application. Then I can eventually optimize around that. Would it be a starting action by any means? Not recommend that if you're sub like 10k a day and spend. But when you get to the point where you're running cyclic campaigns and you need that next campaign to be able to start launching to scale up to the next level, that can be an action you can consider. And that can also be when it's appropriate to switch from the embedded application to the button. Okay. Anyway. To continue on. Main thing I'm trying to make clear with this whole conversion rate that we're talking about, 3% to 5% is pretty usual. And again, that's for a qualified call being booked, taken against the total clicks to the page. Okay. Very important to note, different niches also require you to do different things. So sometimes, like, let me give you an example of when this is appropriate. If we sell to the blue collar demographic, that demographic time and time again, never consumes the videos, like ever. Okay. It's so rare for them to press the videos. So, so if you have a low play rate, one thing that you can do as a solution to still get that consumption to occur is you can add the additional sections to the page. OK, so as an example, let's say that you still have your application here. Sections, meaning everything that's covered in your VSL can essentially become a section that you add to the page. So. Each section, simply put—very simple to understand this. is You are talking about something that you talked about inside of the VSL. That you just want to make sure is covered. Because again, with that blue collar demographic as a key example. Dude, you're going to see, like, I'm not even exaggerating, like 5% to 10% as the play rate. Inside of that specific demographic, like time and time again. Doesn't even fucking matter the offer. That's just what you see. As a result of that, we just take everything that's covered in the BSL and we might have like 10 sections or 15 sections on the page and make it like a really long scrolled page. We had this client, he sold to asphalt contractors and contractors in general. He had a $50,000 to $100,000 offer. And simply put, that offer had that type of play rate. And when we kept the page like this, just headline VSL and application, our cost per qualified call was still good. You know, the KPI was around. The 200s we were right around there, but it just felt high— it felt like unnaturally high— and it felt like we could get it a lot lower, and so yeah, again, all we did was just take the sections of the VSL and just just build a long ass page. I think we ended up with like eight or nine sections on the page in total. And then we got our cost per qualified call down into about the $110 to $140 range, give or take the fatigue in the cycle. So again, if you have a low play rate, very simple thing that you could do is just build out sections on the page. That's the point I'm trying to emphasize with this. But keep in mind, sometimes if you have a low play rate, but you still see a high intent lead come through. Right? Just consider that you really need to. The only time that I generally pull this one out of the hat is when I'm seeing a higher cost per result than I want to, and I believe I could drive it down further by increasing the consumption. Prior to the application getting filled out. Also, I'll pull this out of the hat if I'm getting a lower intent lead. To the page. Okay, if I'm getting a lower intent lead to the page, who's not pressing play on the videos, the ones who do book calls, the salespeople give feedback like, 'Yeah, they seem early in the sales cycle.' They're not even really consuming the backend sales system assets, like anything like that. Then again, I'm definitely going to be looking on the front end for how I could solve those problems. I'm going to focus on traffic to be fair, but in addition to that, I'm potentially going to pull this one out of the hat. Okay, I'm just going to pause real quick just before we continue on. I got a bunch more stuff I want to cover, but there's a question in the chat. It looks like from Daniel. Daniel says, 'How are you setting this up properly for attribution?' I have so many issues trying to get the data, like which ad they clicked on when using Typeform slash Calendly. Um, Daniel. Can you articulate that question further? Like, what kind of data specifically are you looking for? Yeah, so I haven't been able to figure out how to track the actual ad that they're clicking on when using Typeform. So that's why I've stuck with Go High Level. Is that data that you can get? What attribution tool are you attempting to use to see that data? Wicked. Yeah, understood. So generally, I haven't used Wicked for a long time now, to be fair. I'm not in any way, shape, or form against Wicked reports, but I just want to be very direct in saying Hyros does show that data. For the individual ad that they clicked through from. Depends on how you set it up, to be fair. Like if you're using dynamic ads, you might have problems with it still. But if you're using the individual ads. That can still show you that data. You might need to reach out to Wicked Reports directly and see how you're potentially setting it up wrong because the UTMs should be able to pass through. Like we don't have that issue with Typeform or any other application software that we're sometimes forced to use. It's just about getting the attribution. Excuse me. It's just about getting the UTMs to be able to pass through. Does that make sense? Yeah, because, like, what essentially we've determined is— we can do it straight to the type form, but if we have an embedded type form on the landing page, like it, it just loses that data or we can't track it somehow. Yeah, understood. Simply put, sounds like a highly technical question that one of these supports, like whether it be Wicked Reports or Hyros, as an example, should be able to help. Okay. I can't stress it enough though. The solution is very simple. Yeah. You just have to get the UTMs to pass through to, through the application, to that confirmation page for it to be able to attribute successfully. That's it. So you just have a UTM drop problem. That's all. Okay. Yeah. Thanks. Yep. And I can't affirm to the fact that we do get it to work. I'm not necessarily sure if there's like some specific function that my tech team is using. You get it to pass through successfully. But I know that there's a setting inside a type form. If you go into a specific form and you click settings, there's like a UTM option. And I believe that what they have to do is they have to dynamically pull it from the URL into the actual type form setting that I'm talking about. So keep in mind, it's just a tech issue that you're having. Yeah, okay. Functionality should be there, though. Thanks. Vince says, this is a million percent true. I see this happen to low ticket funnels every day. Static image ads equals low CPA, but lower AOV. High curiosity, low commitment, yeah, so true. Video ads equal higher CPA, but massively higher AOV because they're much more sold on the concept. Yeah, it's very interesting how that works, but I see it time and time again, Vince. Thank you for reaffirming that. Timothy says, 'I have the same problem in the past.' If you embedded the pixel slash high-rose on the actual application page, it will fire. Then you can have the pixel slash high-rose code on the calendar page as well. Don't need to pull the UTM on the link if you have the pixel slash high-res on the first page in calendar. Thank you for that, Timothy. Do you want to unmute yourself and give any additional insight to Daniel, or is that good enough? I think that's pretty much it. I went through, I probably spent like three days trying to figure it out because it's like super techie. Yep. And then I jumped on with Hyro support. I don't know how Wicked reports work. But. I believe we could actually go as well. It should have the same functionality. Yeah, I would imagine so. But it's like, it's pretty simple. If you just have the code on the application page and then the calendar page, it can get the UTM on the first page and then it like indexes it or something and tracks the person. Nice. Very good. Thank you for that. Okay, cool. Does anybody else have any questions before we continue? Feel free to unmute yourself if you do, or you can drop your question in the chat if you have anything on what we've talked about so far. All right, cool. Let's continue on then. So one thing that I always preach, and this is very important to understand, is opt-ins. Are the Devil. Okay. Can't stress it enough. I want to be very fair in saying. And this is always really important to understand about anything that I ever talk about, guys, okay? I don't want to be right. I just want to make money. If you, for some reason, have an opt-in on your page and you're still wildly profitable, then fantastic. Keep the opt-in on the page. Okay. What I see time and time again, across without exaggeration, hundreds of different businesses in a given month. Okay. That comes to me and asks me for advice and talks to me about shit. Like I preach this so frequently. And I can't stress it enough. I have people with opt-ins that just artificially have higher cost per calls. Okay, that's really it. That's all it ever comes down to. They are artificially inflating their own cost per call. And then the logic every single time is the same. It's, well, I have an opt-in because I want to make sure that we can follow up with the people who don't apply. And they think, okay, that's the key thing here. They think that they make more money as a result of having the opt-in on the page for being able to follow up with the unconverted people. But let me be so clear when I say this, and I'll give you a few different examples of how this works, okay? Number one, and this is very simple to understand. You have to do the math. If you have an opt-in on your page, and you have not run the math by going into your CRM and just saying, okay, show me everybody who opted in that did not apply, and later bought. And when you run that math, every single time I get exposure to that math, it proves my point every single fucking time, which is it does not convert. Okay. So they think, okay, they've placebo themselves into thinking. I'm going to make more money by having an opt-in, by being able to follow up with people who don't convert. And then when they actually do the math, I'm not exaggerating. A majority of the time, it's literally $0 that gets made from those people. Why? Because they're extremely low intent, low financially qualified leads. Okay. So I say this all the time as well. The more financially qualified an individual is, the much lower the probability is that they opt in. Okay, they're just going to leave. They have a completely different buying behavior. When they go to the page, they need the information. Or, like I told you with the tax strategist example, they need the opportunity to convert right away. If you don't give them that opportunity, then again, they're just going to fucking leave. Okay. So then, when you get the people that opt in, it's typically a lower qualified demographic in terms of financials. And. I want to stress this with an example from an Inner Circle member and also a consulting deal named James. So in James's business, this is actually a very interesting example to point out. They don't use an opt-in. But they have a very long type form application. Their application is about 18 questions on average. Okay, 18 questions. And every single time we lower the quantity of questions in the application, we get a significantly lower intent lead that comes through the other side to the closers. As you can imagine. Okay. And so this is very important. You understand this. An opt-in is generally pre-populated. Like think of a browser that you've used recently that doesn't automatically pre-populate your name and email into an opt-in form when you go to opt-in for anything or fill something out or buy something, okay? So that alone, much lower intent. They don't have to type anything. This is a really good pro tip, okay? You opt-ins aside, like more so talking about applications now. Having questions in the application that people have to actually like fill out answers for— is a huge intent signal. Okay. Obviously, we need multiple choice questions for our conditional logic-based questions. And sometimes multiple choice questions, whether they're conditional or not, meaning they disqualify or qualify an individual. They can still have their purpose, but pepper in a few questions or just a question that's a short form answer where the individual needs to type out a response. Okay. That signals intent. And what you're looking for is intent. Now I'm going to give you the most pro tip ever. Okay. And pay attention to this one. If you are optimizing around a scheduled qualified call. And you see that about half your people come through with intent and the other half don't. But on paper in the application, you allow both through because technically they answered the conditional based questions correctly and then they were allowed to schedule a call. Okay, again, just to reiterate the problem, you get people on a call and your salespeople are saying time and time again, 'Hey, half these people are really high intent. The other half are really low intent.' What you can do is you can have a step. In between the conversion API firing back— the standard event to the pixel— you can have a step in between that in Zapier that leverages AI. To just do a very simple thing: Count the quantity of words that were answered in the short form questions that they had to type answers to. And if it is above a certain word count that you get to pick. Fire off that individual to the conversion API, assuming they were qualified and booked a call. So simply put, let me explain this on a technical level, okay? If I get an individual— who does these things, right?—so they fill out the app. Okay. Then they go schedule a call. And then that individual, obviously, I could just use the web-based pixel, right? So they go to a qualified confirmation page. And you know, this has all the best practices, breakout videos, et cetera. Now, if you are using the web-based pixel, right, and you experience that problem I just articulated, well, instead, don't use the web-based pixel. What you should do instead is have a middle step. So as soon as that individual schedules. Right. Take it over to Zapier. And inside of Zapier, you're going to do a very simple thing, right? You're obviously going to have the conversion API fire off, but rather than just do that, have an AI review step. For the type form question that was filled out. Okay. And based on word count. Okay, people above a certain word count. They. then get the conversion API. To fire off. Back to that pixel. And people below a certain word count, you can still let them book the call, of course. You can still let them get on the phones. Right? That's A-OK. But... you do not want to fire off that individual back to the pixel. Because what happens is, as we all know and have been trained inside of this group, for all those who have learned the conditional logic and pixel conditioning lessons, we want to condition our pixel with the right people exclusively. You understand? So if I only send high intent leads, which can be signaled based on a word count that's been answered inside of an application. Okay, back to that pixel. I'm naturally going to obviously start getting more people that are typically higher intent. Okay, and that's also one more additional pro tip I want to add in. If they answer below a particular word count, you can also then have an additional step in the zap. That takes that calendar booking that just occurred and was booked on to, let's say, like a top closers calendar. And you can have it put on, you can have it reassigned. To an entry-level closer or even a setter comparatively. You understand? You can also then have different marketing automation sequences fire off to these individuals. So a lower intent lead, maybe they need more emails prior to the calls. Right? Maybe those are the people specifically that you want to hammer more. Right? Maybe those are the people specifically that simply put— you just want to put some extra attention on prior to the call to be able to work them up to a point where they convert. You understand? So this is really good as a solution in the instance that you're seeing a lower intent lead show up. About half the time. Right. Timothy says, have you tested using financial data to determine a qualified lead internally and then train the pixel to fire on those people? Yes. There's occasional clients that use, it's really just one solution right now. I don't believe that there's any others that currently exist called LeadFi. And LeadFi, you can negotiate them down. Let me just be clear. The guy who runs that business. Whatever the fuck he tells you to pay, don't pay it, okay? Negotiate them down to like $1. 50 a lead. Tell them to get fucked above anything else, okay? $2 max per lead. All right. You pay per lead in order to get their IRS data. I'm under the impression, by the way, it only works for United States citizens. I'm not under the impression that it works for anybody else. And I know we have a rather large international crowd here. So to be clear, this is only for the U. S. boys or people targeting the U. S. Leadfly gives you their IRS data for what they reported as income, and it also pulls their credit scores. I believe from Experian or FICO. And with that data, you can then do this exact same kind of thing where you leverage conditional logic. Inside of a marketing automation sequence that says, 'Okay, if their data after it comes back from lead five is above this threshold, then fire that data back to the conversion API and subsequently the pixel to optimize around those people, technically being the ones that show his conversion. Same kind of logic. Great pixel conditioning lesson. Anyway, point I'm trying to make. He is. Okay, number one, opt-ins are the devil, right? If you have done the math and you see that opt-ins create revenue for you, that's awesome, right? But if you want to naturally lower your cost per qualified call, typically removing an opt-in is great. Now, like I'm talking sub 5% of the time, I've seen where somebody, when they remove an opt-in, actually sees a higher cost per qualified call. And for some specific offers and audience types, having an opt-in can drive down your cost per call comparatively. But that is sub 5% of the time that I've seen that in my career. The 95% of the time is it just drives up your cost per call, qualified call artificially. You'd never make any fucking money from the people who opt in because they're very low intent. And you don't generally have a setter team that's like— actually calling on these people and doing anything. That's the only other time it arguably makes sense to do is when you have fucking a team of killers that are just dialing on these people and actually making money from it. Very important to note. Andrew in the chat says, 'We use SalesKit too. I think they use simplecheck. com for data. It grades the application. We only send high-grade apps back to the pixel. Very good, Andrew. Thank you very much for that. Okay, so moral of the story. I just want to stress a few key things in terms of like literal CRO actions you could take on the page now that we've gotten a majority of that stuff out of the way. Let me just fire a few off. Okay. Number one, sometimes all you got to do is lower the quantity of application questions that you have. Be mindful of the fact that that can sometimes reduce the intent of the lead. If you are going to reduce the overall application questions, just make sure that you add some questions that people need to type answers to that can typically still maintain intent while driving down cost per qualified call from just simply reducing the application question count. As we've talked about, try to integrate the calendar and the application together. That'll also naturally drive down your cost per qualified call. You can change headlines routinely. One thing that we saw inside of the inner circle chat is a set of questions. I typed in the word 'broad' and I found this, and I pressed 'show list'. And then, as a result of pressing 'show list', I clicked on this one here. And I believe that I saw a headline nearby. Let's see if I can find that again. Oh boy, it looks like it was quite a while ago. Let's type in the word 'headline' and see. There is. A great use case for Jeremy AI when it comes to typing headlines. We typically, time and time again, see that the headlines make a significant difference to the frame that people have here. It is so this is this is from Eric specifically. He had this offer that he's trying to sell currently. Where you know he's just teaching different people in what he believed when he wrote this to be agency owners and beginners how to essentially just sell AI services to businesses, okay? Now, I thought this headline that he wrote was terrible. So, how agency owners and beginners are becoming AI growth integrators to generate 20 to 40K a month helping businesses adapt to the AI gold rush. Now, it's very simple. But I can't stress this enough. Generally calling out an audience is only good to do when you're selling to one particular audience. If you have to work in like multiple audience types, it can look real silly, real fast. Two of the guys in the inner circle, Daniel Fazio and his business partner, Christian from ListKit. Christian recently tweeted something funny where somebody had written a DM where it was like, 'How we help agency owners, roofers. Business owners above this amount of revenue and like five other call outs.' And then he went into the messaging. It just looks so silly. You know, it looks so silly. So I don't believe that call outs typically make sense. Especially when they're like wildly different call outs. And also I say this all the time: typically income claims can get you in some hot water and increase the probability that you're going to get banned for compliance related issues. But more importantly than anything else, like it can also cause just all kinds of problems with skepticism. It also generally attracts a lower financially qualified audience and/ or it limits the people who are already far richer than that that might just view this as an insignificant number. So very important to note. Headlines make a significant difference to the overall frame that somebody has when they come to the page. Okay, so if I look at just the standard call funnel page that we encourage, obviously the headline is one third of the page. Right. We want to make sure that that headline is relatively broad in terms of what it communicates. But we also want to make sure that it reaffirms that the higher intent leads are in the right place. So I can't stress it enough. Jeremy AI is trained on literally every single piece of copy that I've ever written, every single headline copy related training I've ever done. And, you know, it's very effective. And as an example of that, like I had I had Jeremy write up these headlines here. Comparatively to this one, as I said, like this one I didn't like, Jeremy AI wrote, the new AI consultant role businesses are hiring for that anyone can learn. AI is disrupting every industry. Here's how to get paid helping businesses keep up. uh, why business owners are paying for help navigating the AI shift and how to offer it. What if you could help businesses use AI? even if you're brand new. Like this headline, comparatively, now read this, right? How agency owners and beginners are becoming AI growth integrators. Like, what the fuck even is that? You know, you got to make sure that when you write a headline, when I, when I use the word, like write it broad, essentially what I'm attempting to say is: you need to make sure that people actually read it and can relate to it and like understand what the fuck you're talking about. You know, that's very critical when you're looking at a headline, right? So again, when you look at these options that I articulated, like people know what a consultant is. They might not know what an AI consultant is. Again, agreeable statements and headlines also make a big difference. Like that second one, AI is disrupting every industry. Here's how to get paid helping businesses keep up. Like again, just much more broad and much more relatable. There's not a lot of these like AI consultants that exist yet that are helping implement AI into people's businesses. Like I'm sure that almost all of you sitting here as an example, you're probably just now starting to get pitched on these types of services and your DMs. You're probably just now starting to see ads for them. And to be rather direct, you yourself are probably the ones that are integrating all this stuff rather than... you know, paying other people to do it by far and large. So anyway, the point I'm attempting to make is like the headline on the page is obviously what frames everything. And if it's disagreeable, if it's something that isn't relatable, if it's something that doesn't reiterate what you just framed them on from the ad coming to the page and it feels very different, then again, that won't make much sense. I'll go back to that same tax strategist example that I provided earlier today. So as I'd mentioned. I get targeted by an ad, very great messaging in the video ad. Hey, you're a rich guy now. tax CPAs, bookkeepers, and tax attorneys. Like, dude, those people aren't strategically trying to reduce your taxes legally. You need a tax strategist. You know, you're a rich guy now. We need to legally reduce your taxes to as low as we can get them. You know, press this link and I'll show you how we do it. So again, I clicked the link. Now on this particular ad, they had the very similar messaging to the first one that I'd clicked through to that hid the application for a certain amount of time. So I left. As I mentioned, the way the algorithm works nowadays, I just get smashed for like a mile worth of the newsfeed on every ad that was very similar to that. So every subsequent ad had very similar messaging, simply put, damn near the exact same thing. But when I clicked through to one of the pages of the following people, the page had a lot of incongruency to what the ad said. Remember, the ad essentially said, 'Hey, you're a rich guy now.' I assume that he's talking to business owners. Okay, that's typically why I identify as rich guys. On the page, a lot of this guy's page was written with words that kept saying W-2. It's like, 'Hey, if you're a high-paid W-2 or entrepreneur.' And due to the fact that there was so much mentioning of this like W-2 individual, I thought it wasn't for me at that point, even though he used the word entrepreneur. That's an example of the dual call-outs. It's like the dual callout didn't make any sense in that example. It also created incongruency between the ad and the page. And so sometimes I just want to be really clear when I say this, like sometimes your conversion rate on the page is a little lower simply because your ad claims one thing, but then your page seems very different and it doesn't align to what the ad talked about that drove them there. And this is a very simple advertising lesson that's been tried and true for all ages, right? I need consistency and congruency between my ad and my landing page to have the highest possible conversion rate. As soon as I move away from that best practice, I'm going to have a bad time. Right. That guy's entire page should have just said. 'Things about being rich and how you can legally reduce your taxes as much as possible through tax strategy.' That's all that guy should have talked about on that page. His conversion rate would be— fucking quadruple if he did something like that. You get what I'm saying? It's that simple. Okay. It's generally that simple. And then the applications and the VSL, obviously they follow the same exact concept. It's like, let me also be clear on this. This is another pro tip. If I want to increase my play rate, I have to tell people in the ad to click and watch the video on the next page. Right? Like sometimes you guys don't make any call to actions inside of your ads that tell people there's a video on the next page. And then you bitch about having a low play rate. It's like, if we have a video on the next page, we always pretty much end the ad. Click the button below and watch the short video I've put together for you on the following page. That alone can wildly influence play rates and how somebody's framed going to the site. Right. That alone can wildly influence whether somebody is going to convert or not. It's like we can do the same thing with applications, by the way. We can say, 'click to the next page.' I have a short video I put together for you that walks through everything I can do for you. And then you'll fill out an application and talk to our team. Looking forward to helping you get started. You know, it's like actually articulating in your call to action what you literally want people to do. I know it sounds a little silly. But it's like mentioning it, not just at the end, but like in the middle of the ad as well, makes a big difference to how people are framed going to the page. Can't stress it enough though. One of the other simplest things you could do if you're seeing a high cost per qualified call and you're also seeing like low play rate, even if you are seeing high play rates and you're seeing high engagement rates and you just want to potentially drive up your conversions, just remember this best practice of just taking the things covered in the VSL and breaking them out into sections on the page. That can make a significant difference to the information consumption because, give or take, your niche. People have different preferences for how they consume what it is that you're talking about. Timothy has a question. So, if you have ads that go after multiple different demographics and angles, you should have different landing page variations with a headline that matches the angle. Absolute. Abso-fucking-lutely. This is actually historically a best practice on Google, Timothy. So, if you look at... My week four class of the Master Internet Marketing, we go through Google AdWords in that specific week. And I talk about this very frequently. This has been a best practice at Google since the inception of Google AdWords. They call it relevance. Okay. So what they encourage you to do on Google AdWords. They encourage you. So it's called ad groups, first of all, for the audiences that you're going to target. So you define an ad group, whether it be keyword or interest-based, give or take what you're targeting, whether you're doing YouTube or, you know, search on that platform or, God forbid, the display network. You define an ad group and they say, as a best practice, the ad group should have relevance, okay? And then they say on the ad level, obviously, you're— ads need to communicate to the ad group you're targeting. And then the landing page needs to have relevance to what the ads talk about and to the people that you targeted. And in that class for week four of the Mastering Internet Marketing class, to be clear, I used the example of somebody searching for dog food. OK, and if I search the term 'dog food' with a keyword, I would obviously expect all the ads that serve up to literally say things about dog food, right? That's the example of relevance there. So all my search terms, like I would not add 'cat food' and 'dog food' into the same ad group. Right. I would separate them into different ad groups in that example. And then again, on the ad level, it's like. If I did combine them together, the best practice that would seem obvious would be to just talk about pet food in general, like high-quality pet food, pet pharmaceuticals, and pet toys. But, like those, those three things right there, they're an efficiency and a selfish thing for you, but they lower the perception of Google being able to give a relevant result. Answer to an individual so like users, whether they bitch about privacy concerns or not, every single person wants personalized ads. Okay, that's what they're more probable to respond to, and and again, time and time again, we've actually heard very positive things from users from all different kinds of studies that these large tech ad platforms have done about how people have a preference for relevancy. So, anyway, long story short, Facebook's a little different in the sense that You Know, broad targeting is the best practice there. And so you have a much lower probability to be able to section off like ad sets that are relevant to like who you're going to target. Let's just assume you did broad targeting, right? And you then set up a bunch of individual ads, okay? Or you had, let's use the example, ad set one is just broad targeting and ad set two is broad targeting. Targeting but on the ad level, inside of those two ad sets, inside an ad set, one that does broad you have all of the messaging that's for, like, demographic A. And then, an ad set two, where you're also doing broad targeting on the ad level, you have demographic B for all the messaging that's there. It's really simple. In demographic A's ad set and the ad, you would just drive the traffic to a page that communicates to that specific demographic, right? And same thing for demographic B. The ad set and ad, right? It's like moral of the story is relevance still applies to any ad channel, whether it's Google AdWords or not, but Google AdWords, especially comparatively to any of the other ones. They literally punish you if you do not have relevance across those three different levels, the ad group, the ad, and the landing page. You have to have relevance congruency between the three of them. Now, Facebook won't necessarily punish you for that. But if you, as an example, want to have like more favorable CPMs, higher conversion rates, like, yeah, absolutely build a page. Like in the example we saw with Eric's headline here. It's like, this would be a great example to just split it. You know, like why not have one for agency owners and have one for quote unquote beginners, right? And it's like the way I wrote the headlines, again, this would be very applicable for Facebook, especially it's like. It just makes more sense to make it broad in that example, which could also act as a best practice. So I'm not in any way, shape, or form telling you that you need to have relevance on like Facebook or the broader targeting ad channels. However, yeah, dude, it's a great tactic. It's a phenomenal tactic that can drive additional conversions, no doubt. Other questions on anything so far, guys? Feel free to unmute yourself or drop your questions in the chat if you have some. Timothy, do you have something? Yeah, quick follow-up to that. If you were testing a bunch of different angles or new, you know, I guess, yeah, a bunch of different angles. Would you make a specific landing page for, or would you just test it and then, once it's proven, you well, how different are the angles that you're communicating about, like, wait, how wide are they? Yeah. So, for this specific example, that comes to mind is we sell to people that sell, like, advanced markets, life insurance. So there's one demographic that'll do annuities. There's one demographic that'll do IULs and there's some that do both. A lot of the annuity guys hate the IULs. So, if we put anything about IULs, it's going to detract those people. So I'm thinking we would make a separate one. That makes total sense to break out for sure. I completely agree with that. I'm going to give you a counter example from my niche that I don't think would make any sense just for the lesson. You likely care about all these things. Having a higher show rate, having higher intent leads show up on calls, having shorter sales cycles, having more piffs, okay, and having a lower cost per qualified call, correct? Yeah, for sure. Okay. That and that example makes perfect sense for me to just talk all about it on one page. It's like, I don't have to break out the show rates onto their own page and their own communication in ads. I don't have to break out those other ones that I just articulated onto their own pages and with their own ads either. It's like, generally, when somebody cares about one of those, they typically care about all of them. Now, the example you provided comparatively, you straight up said, 'Hey, this demographic who sells annuities, they fucking hate IULs.' Right. And that's very common in the insurance world. Like, there's plenty of people who sell term life insurance that think whole life insurance is retarded. So in that case, that makes perfect sense to break out. Right. And so, if you understand that about your specific demographic, that's absolutely a great time to consider a breakout strategy. Just remember it's a little higher effort, right? That's all it is. It's nothing crazy. Just always remind yourself, dude, you're not in a fucking coal mine. You know, you're clicking buttons and moving around a mouse. You know, it's not that bad using your brain. You got, I mean, just like spend a little bit extra time to get that, that separation of assets. And I think you'll have a good time. Does that make sense? Yeah. And I'm assuming, like, just a separate VSL too would probably make sense too for scaling both. That's correct. Yeah, that's correct. Again, when you look at the page itself, it's like the page itself typically is when we talk about relevance, right? You talk about a congruency. Typically, everything gets updated. the page. Yep. Cool. Appreciate it. Okay, very good. Okay, I can't necessarily think if there's anything that I'm missing right now. I believe that I generally covered most of what I would generally talk about. I mean, obviously, lowering the quantity of applicants. Questions can result in a lower cost per qualified call, but you also got to monitor the intent. Don't be sold that you need to hide an application for a certain amount of minutes until they pass. Generally, the only time to do that is if you're selling to a general public audience with like a fucking brain rot attention span. I want to be fair in saying, like, we have a guy in the inner circle. His name's Brooke. He does over 2 million a month and Brooke hides his application for a few minutes on the page. And I also believe Brooke does opt-ins. His demographic though is typically a more entry-level demographic and it's lower ticket relative to what most of us sell inside of this group. So it's one of those situations where, you know, like, technically, there's people in the group where, if I told them, 'Hey, lower the quantity of application questions you have,' that would shoot them in the foot because they found time and time again through testing that the higher quantity of application questions they have, the higher intent buyer they have. Therefore, the shorter the sales cycle that they have and the higher the quantity of pips they have. And that drives their whole business model to be able to scale. So this is all like. Simply put, one of those situations where. Damn near everything is true, you know. Like, nothing's necessarily like a demonized thing. Um, I personally think the only demonized thing is opt-ins. Just from the fact that again, 95% of the time that you do have an opt-in, it results in catastrophic failure and just artificially inflated cost per result and no additional revenue. But I can't stress it enough. Like, I've seen, without people using type form. Calendly and integrated software is like a good example of this. Every single Josh Troy deal we do, they absolutely fucking hate Calendly, but it's mainly because they're a sales agency and they are. That by force, every time they do a deal, you have to use the tech stack that they tell you to use. You cannot use whatever your preferential tech stack is. And that's because, across all these different deals, they operate on, it's for their own selfish efficiency in that example. So it's like in that example, every single deal I do with Josh Troy, I have to tell the client, 'I'm like, hey, by the way. You know, we're getting a 100% higher cost per qualified call than we could. If we had a different tech stack.' But it's like, you just have to know that, you know, that's the preference of the sales organization in this case. So that's just kind of what you got to deal with. It's like, it's a tough sell. But long story short, it's like, that's sometimes how it goes. There's preference, there's preferential tech stacks. Now, does that negate the fact that we're still like three to one or five to one ROI on VSL call funnels with like high couple? hundred grand a month being spent on them. No, I mean, dude, they're still very profitable and we still scale the shit out of them. And they still hit million dollar months with that specific tech stack, you know? So long story short. Could we have even more ROI? Yeah, absolutely we could. Could we spend half as much and make literally just as much? Yeah, yeah, actually, yeah, we could. But do we get to do that? No, because they have a preferential bias tech stack. And that's a great example of what I'm sitting here yapping about, which is. Listen, I love Typeform and Calendly, but even on deals I do, like I don't always get to use it, based on the bias of the organization or the people that already have entrenched themselves within the organizations with whatever tech stack it is that they use. And sometimes, to be fair, it's a risk to change from one tech stack to another just based on. The amount of automations on the back end that it's integrated with is an example, depending on the scale you operate at. So sometimes you get entrenched into what you do. I want to be fair in saying, like, I don't like that. And I would encourage, you know, changing when necessary to the things that are very probable to work better. But, you know, remember, don't ever go all in on a test. Always test it first. Prove out the fact that it works and that it gets the outcome that you're after and that it's favorable and then lean into it and go all in. So for anything that we've talked about here, like if you already have something that works and you already have something that's profitable, you know, keep it running, keep it scaling, work in some of these other initiatives that we talked about as a test. Like as a private example of that, I'll reiterate this again. We have an inner circle member that just joined in. They're profitably optimizing a call funnel campaign for the lead standard event. I encouraged optimizing around the schedule standard event. And so all I simply told him to do— I was like, 'Hey man, throw the schedule standard event on that confirmation page, dupe out the campaign optimized for schedule, throw a test budget at it and let's see what it does. You know, let's see what the cost per call is. Let's see how the quality is as a result. And that worked a ton. So anyway, moral of the story is. I just can't stress it enough. Anything that we sat here and talked about today, just don't go all in on it. Run a test, see how it goes, and then lean into it after it actually works. And just keep in mind, there's plenty of things that you could do on the traffic side of things as well without changing a damn thing on the page itself that wildly influence. is the cost per result and the overall conversion rate of these pages. So never neglect that when you're considering tests. And then, of course, as a golden rule of marketing that I follow and live by—what I call a law— we always bias typically towards what's most efficient and what's most probable to generate the most revenue. So in some instances, like just changing up some ads might be the most efficient thing comparatively to having to do an overhaul on a BSL or change the entire page. So as a function of that belief that I have, I would encourage you to think the same. You know, it typically has helped us tremendously generate far larger results for people, simply put, just from taking the actions that are most efficient and easiest to do, seeing if they work best. If not, then we bias towards the higher output actions that require us to do more and then see if we get a result doing that. We typically... Gen and this is a general rule of thumb as well. We work with busy, rich people for a living, so we never try to encourage actions that they need to take that are going to take significant time and effort on their part. That's also a great reason as to why that belief exists for us— biasing towards the things that are typically more efficient and just easier to do first, right? And again, that works great for us time and time again. I'd encourage you to do the same because you're also all busy, rich people. So you get how it is. Anybody have any questions for me on any of this? Any follow-up questions? Anything you guys want to add? Feel free to unmute yourself if you do or drop something in the chat. Okay, cool. Just a quick note. We announced the Q4 Inner Circle Mastermind dates, October 11th and 12th are confirmed. Also, just a complete side note. I put in an offer on a commercial facility to turn into an event venue relative to how big the group is. We'll be able to pull the cars into it. We'll be able to. just control the room a lot more. We'll be able to put up our own, like simply put, I'll have like more of a culture to it. And I think that we're just going to bus everybody over to the penthouse for the, for the networking sessions at night there on Saturday. And I'm really excited about it. I think it's going to be awesome. I'll wait to post any videos or photos about it. I believe to be clear that the Q4 event will realistically still be held there at the Paramount, just like our Q3, Q2, and Q1 events so far this year has been. But I just want to be fair in saying, like, just relative to the group growth. I had to put in this offer on this commercial facility just as a fail-safe in the instance that we have too many people because I do have a hard cap on the quantity of people I can fit inside of that room there at the Paramount. other one is a far larger facility. So there's a potential that we'll have a new venue for Q4, simply put, or there's a potential that this could be one of the last ones that we get to have there at the Paramount there. In the movie theater room for our main session. If we do get the opportunity to move over to the event venue, I ordered a 286 inch LED screen. So visibility wise, in terms of the presentations, I believe the movie theater screen in the Paramount is a little bit faint and you don't necessarily get to see it that well. Relative to where you sit in the room, this LED screen is like a fucking sports monitor. I think it's literally as big as like a basketball arena center screen that's above the court, if you guys are familiar with that. So very exciting. Really looking forward to it. But October 11th and 12th, simply put, are the dates for this upcoming mastermind. Pencil it in. And I'll see all you guys there who are going to make it out. And of course, per usual, if you guys have any follow-up questions on what we talked about today, ping me in the group chat or shoot me a DM. I'm happy to answer any of your questions. Thank you guys for being here. Bye.
