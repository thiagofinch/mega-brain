[00:00]
Okay. So, uh, three different times this week I've had one-on-one conversations with you guys. Uh, it seems like YouTube seems to be a hot topic right now for everybody wanting to diversify off of Facebook, Instagram, or considering Tik Tok is potentially going to go down here in the United States.
[00:15]
We got some people that are trying to divest away and get YouTube working. So, long story short, um I wanted to go through some of the best practices, uh what we'd consider the lowest hanging fruit on the Google Adwords platform specific to YouTube as a placement.
[00:30]
And I figured I'd share those lessons with you guys on this weekly group call today. So, for starters, there's obviously a lot of things that we can do on YouTube, including broad targeting. Uh broad targeting would be demographic, interest, and behavior targeting.
[00:45]
Broad targeting could also be considered similar audiences, which is AdWords version of lookalike audiences. um those are considered like the farthest lowest probability of what's going to work for you when you initially get on YouTube especially.
[01:00]
You have to understand that there are a lot higher probability actions that you could take that are lot higher up on the food chain in terms of odds of making you money and they're very simple but you just got to understand the functionality and features of YouTube and a little bit of due diligence on what you can search and and once again what's possible.
[01:20]
So to be clear for starters competitive research is a great way to start the ideation process. Okay, I'll give you guys an example with uh one of the most recent conversations I believe I had yesterday with an inner circle student, Andrew.
[01:35]
Andrew has an Amazon course. Andrew targets two types of people. Andrew targets people who are looking to get started with an Amazon course. Andrew also targets people who are below 10K a month with their Amazon store and looking to scale up.
[01:50]
Andrew does about 100K a month himself with his Amazon business. So, he doesn't want to target people that are close to that and tell them that they can go higher. pretty much anybody doing let's call it 50k a month or less could be an ideal customer for Andrew although he articulates it like it's 10k a month or less.
[02:10]
So noobs and people looking to scale up. Now to be clear right off the bat with both of those demographics we can start to do some competitive analysis for who is likely out there already targeting these individuals.
[02:25] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Competitive Analysis Strategy"
NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Conceito de análise competitiva, identificação de anunciantes já testando no mercado, economia de budget em testes
[02:30]
And the reason we want to start off with competitive analysis is so we can go out there and gather some ads that are potentially already working for your competitors who are already spending money on the testing cycle.
[02:45]
The one downside of YouTube in comparison to the other ad channels that are popular such as Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok, even LinkedIn, you can throw shit at the wall and it sticks on those platforms with a very high rate of success.
[03:00]
I've seen terrible ads perform exceptionally well on those platforms. That's not how it goes on YouTube. YouTube is a different game. Really, Adwords in general is a different game. It takes a lot more testing and creative iteration before it is probable to work.
[03:20] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Impression Share Metric"
NÚMEROS: Percentual de impressões disponíveis vs alcançadas
VISUAL: Métrica de transparência do YouTube, visualização de potencial de escala, comparação entre alcance atual e potencial total
[03:25]
The good news is is that once you find the specific combination of creatives and targeting options that are going to work best for you, it is very scalable and it's also very transparent of how much more you can scale into that winning combination of targeting and creative.
[03:40]
They have a statistic called impression share which represents to you the total amount of impressions that are available for you to get in front of and the percentage of which you are already getting in front of out of that total available audience that you could target.
[03:55]
It's a very transparent statistic that's very helpful in that regard. So moral of the story when I say we start with competitive analysis and we just want to find some ads out there that are already working for people that's because we want to cut the learning curve.
[04:10]
We want to find an opportunity to essentially save ourselves or our clients money by gathering ads that other people have already spent money on and we want to assume that they're probable to already be working.
[04:25]
Okay, so obviously when we start this process just to give you a perspective on it, we want to go to YouTube and if I use Andrew as an example, what we want to do here is we want to search for let me make sure I just go to regular YouTube.com.
[04:40]
want to search in this case as an example for some terms that people are likely to look up how to start an Amazon business when they're trying to get started. Okay. And when we start to search for these different terms right away we're obviously going to see sponsored here at the top.
[05:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Relevance Algorithm Weight"
NÚMEROS: Top 2 placement positions
VISUAL: Fatores de ranqueamento no YouTube - relevância do ad group, relevância do anúncio, relevância da landing page, budget e bid
[05:05]
Okay. Now to be clear, it's important to note one very important metric that is factored in to Adwords in general is what's called relevance. Okay, relevance for your ad group, the ads, and the landing page are all heavily weighted in terms of who is probable to get this top placement and this second placement here when somebody searches specific terms.
[05:25]
Outside of that, there's a few other quality metrics that they factor in, of course, but bidding and your overall ad budget is obviously very factored into that as well.
[05:35]
Now, moral of the story, it's important to note that when I have a relevant group of people that I've lumped together and I have an ad that is specific talking to that group of people I've lumped together and in addition to that, I have a landing page that is also relevant to what I talked about in that ad and that I've targeted towards that specific group of people.
[05:55]
I get rewarded with one of these top two slots when people search for the different terms that I'm targeting. Obviously, I need to bid high as well to be fair.
[06:05]
Point is, I want to start once again competitive analysis. I want to go search a bunch of terms. Let me just take a step back real quick so nobody gets lost in the sauce here.
[06:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Keyword Research Process"
NÚMEROS: 2 demographics principais (iniciantes + escala)
VISUAL: Processo de definição de demographics ideais, geração de termos de busca, compilação de anúncios competidores, análise criativa
[06:20]
I start by defining my ideal demographics. In Andrew's case, it's people getting started on Amazon and people wanting to scale their existing Amazon store. That then gives me an opportunity for some search terms that I can go look up and I'm going to just sit there and I'm going to search and I'm going to search and I'm going to search.
[06:40]
and I'm just going to try to go through and literally watch a bunch of ads and I'm going to try to compile a list of ad videos that competitors are using to target my keyword ideas.
[06:50]
I'm just going to compile a list that way I have some creative analysis that will give me an opportunity to to more easily create an ad that's more probable to work.
[07:00]
While I'm doing that, I'm also taking note on what keywords I'm searching. So, I want to go through and I just want to make sure that I start list building with keywords because keep in mind that's a huge advantage of what AdWords offers is I get the opportunity to target people based on searching this specific word, this specific sentence, this specific phrase.
[07:20]
Okay, that's a huge advantage to AdWords that obviously the other other platforms typically don't offer. Tik Tok has their own version of it to be fair, but Adwords obviously has very high intense traffic that we get the opportunity to target.
[07:35] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "SpyFu.com Tool"
NÚMEROS: 450 keywords, 768 clicks/mês, couple grand spend
VISUAL: Interface de análise competitiva, métricas de PPC research, keywords únicos por competidor, diagrama de Venn de overlap
[07:40]
Um, one thing that I also love to do is a tool called spyfu.com. Now, spyfu does not have specific analysis for YouTube videos. However, it does give us the ability to target people and look up who based on their domain and what keywords they're searching and targeting for.
[08:00]
So, as an example, let's see if I can take this very domain here, this masterfba.com website. Let's see if I can pull it up. Okay, so we're going to go over here to PPC research.
[08:15]
Okay, so this person right here, this masterfba.com website, and this is technically a subdomain. As you can see, they're targeting about 450 total keywords. They're only getting about 768 clicks per month. Doesn't look like they're a heavy advertiser. they're only spending a couple grand.
[08:35] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Venn Diagram Keyword Analysis"
NÚMEROS: 6 unique keywords, 24 unique keywords, 8 overlapping keywords, 1 keyword overlap
VISUAL: Diagrama de Venn com três círculos representando competidores, áreas de overlap mostrando keywords compartilhados, unique keywords por advertiser
[08:40]
But this is one thing that I love about spyfu.com. So in this case, this company in particular has 434 unique keywords that they're targeting. It'll also show me other websites and you always want to look these up.
[08:55]
So like as an example, this one is thesellingguys.com. So if we go search that real quick just to make sure that it's an actual Amazon brand in this case, the sellingguys.com. Yeah. Tips and tricks to boost your Amazon sales. So that'd be a good one.
[09:10]
And then this other one, uh, James Cameron cameronjames.com. Cameron James.com. See what this one pulls up. Once again, we're trying to see. Okay, perfect. So, I help entrepreneurs build sustainable Amazon FBA businesses. Perfect.
[09:25]
So, in this case, this is important to understand. This the selling guy's website has six unique keywords that they're targeting that these other two brands are not targeting. This Cameron James person, he has 24 unique keywords that the selling guys and master FBA aren't targeting.
[09:45]
This little part of the venn diagram, this is typically very valuable. This will show us the keywords that all three of them are targeting. In this case, it doesn't look like all three of them actually have any overlap.
[10:00]
What we can see here is eight keywords that Master FBA and Cameron James are targeting. And then vice versa for the selling guys and Master FBA. In this overlapping part of the venn diagram, we can see what they're targeting.
[10:15]
And then in this case, the selling guys in Cameron James have one keyword that they're targeting. And to be clear, when we click into these, it'll literally show us the keywords specifically.
[10:25] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Keyword Metrics Display"
NÚMEROS: Volume de busca, CPC ideal, número de anúncios competindo
VISUAL: Tabela de keywords com métricas detalhadas, volume mensal, custo por clique estimado, nível de competição
[10:30]
And it'll give us every single keyword that they're that they are targeting. And and to be clear, it also shows us the volume. Typically, it'll also show us an ideal cost per click. And in addition to that, it'll actually show how many ads are specifically being targeted towards that specific demographic or that keyword in this case.
[10:50]
Uh, which are all really good in terms of compiling our list of potential keywords that we're going to target. Now, long story short, when we eventually find a bigger advertiser in our keyword research, what's really cool is we can also take note of them in this competitive analysis section.
[11:10]
So, eventually we're going to find somebody who's a whale in comparison to this masterfa.com. I wouldn't consider them a whale by any means, but they're definitely crushing these other people in comparison.
[11:25]
So, it seems like a very low competition demographic in terms of the word that we initially searched here. Now it's important to note we also have the ability to do PPC keyword research which is great in terms of its function.
[11:40]
U we have the ability to literally search different keywords inside of the platform get additional ideas. U once again just based on the domain research alone we get a great idea of what keywords are probable to work and what keywords are typically the most profitable for that specific demographic.
[12:00]
Um, now this video in particular, this is a two minute 2 minute and 45 second video and it doesn't look initially like it's for Amazon people, but you know, here we obviously can see that it is when we click through to the domain.
[12:15]
I'm sure if we watch the video, we'd also find that to be true. Let's go over here to our PPC overview tab on Spyfu. Let's search up this brand and see if they're a little bigger.
[12:30]
So, this brand looks also very small, but they likely have a higher budget. I want to be fair and saying in some instances and this is a low probability that this is the case. We might just have the wrong domain here and you might not want to search the subdomain.
[12:45]
You might just want to search like their main domain and see if you can get some additional data to pull through. But in this case, this is not a good advertiser. We're not finding a lot of data on that in comparison to what we saw with that masterfba.com website in comparison.
[13:00]
So just kind of keep that in mind. Now, to be clear, this is two advertisers we've found so far just based on searching this one specific phrase of how to start an Amazon business.
[13:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Keyword Variations Examples"
NÚMEROS: Múltiplas variações de termos
VISUAL: Lista de variações de keywords - "how to start Amazon business", "how to start FBA business", "Amazon arbitrage", "Amazon wholesale", termos curtos vs longos
[13:20]
Now, there's obviously many variations. If we were all in this niche, just to give you an idea of a few others, it'd be like how to start an FBA business, how to start an Amazon FBA business. Uh there might be also shorter terms that people search like starting an FBA business, starting Amazon arbitrage, starting Amazon wholesale, uh start Amazon wholesale, Amazon FBA.
[13:45]
Like these are all terms once again that have different levels of varying intent. All of which are going to have different advertisers. So how to start an Amazon FBA business. Okay. Boom. Now we get a different advertiser here. We get the same advertiser down here.
[14:05]
So we know just based on that that this Master FBA company and once again we saw already with our PPC terms, they have 450 different keywords. So it's very probable that they have a good Google Adwords advertiser on their side.
[14:20]
Here we scroll down a little bit further. We have this ecom authority website. If I'm not mistaken, I believe that this is one of those automated Yeah, this is an automation store. So this would not be a course. this would not be like a direct competitor of an Amazon course, but regardless, you know, we could look at their search terms as well.
[14:40]
I believe ecom authority in terms of the automation space is one of the last standing and there's there considering their products are so high, simply put, we'd have a good chance of being able to uh get some keywords out of them and see some heavier spend.
[15:00]
So anyway, moral of the story, good trend here. The moral of the story with this is when we look at this specific advertiser, we can see they're not even running a video here technically. They're just having an ad show up in the sponsored feed and it's clicking straight through to the website versus this is an actual ad that has a video paired brings customers to you. See?
[15:25]
So anyway, moral of the story, we want to do a little bit of research. We want to compile a list of video ads. While doing so, we want to compile a list of landing pages that we could also potentially pull some inspiration from.
[15:40]
We in addition to that want to put together a keyword list by finding the different competitors using analytic tools technically competitive analysis tools like Google Adwords we have the opportunity to see what different people are targeting.
[15:55] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Ad History Analysis in SpyFu"
NÚMEROS: Histórico de anúncios por tempo de execução
VISUAL: Coluna de histórico de anúncios, códigos de cores indicando duração de cada anúncio, headlines variando ou consistentes ao longo do tempo
[16:00]
Now, this is one interesting variable that I like about spyfu.com, which is if somebody's doing PPC ads inside of Google AdWords. We have this ad history column here, which also gives us the ability to see headlines and the history of how long they've been running specific videos or how I'm sorry, how long they've been running specific uh Google PPC ads.
[16:20]
And whenever we see something that has a long history without the color changing, that means that ad's been running for a long time. You could see here without even logging in each one of these different colors, how there's like one, one, one, one one. That means that these people really haven't figured out what works yet on the PPC side of things.
[16:40]
But one thing that we saw is that they have this running on multiple keyword variations right now. So there's a high probability that this specifically is likely working for them right now in comparison.
[16:55]
So anyway, long story short, the main thing I'm trying to articulate to you here in terms of YouTube success right off the bat is we want to cut that learning process down to as short of a time period as we can and not burn as much money as the other people that had to figure everything out before us.
[17:15]
And we do that by once again competitive analysis, looking at what other videos are potentially already working, looking at what keywords are high intent and worth targeting.
[17:25]
And then what we have to do from there is we obviously have to go create some YouTube videos to be able to run his ads. Now when I say lowhanging fruit actions, I want to be very clear in saying this.
[17:40] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Low Hanging Fruit Priority #1"
NÚMEROS: #1 ação mais provável de sucesso
VISUAL: Estratégia de retargeting de audiência existente no YouTube, targeting de pessoas que interagiram com canal, vídeos e playlists
[17:45]
The best thing to do that typically makes the most money first. If you have any type of YouTube presence or channel is obviously just targeting all the people who have interacted with your channel in the past.
[18:00]
You could do the same things as an example on Facebook and Instagram, which I encourage in our content ad strategies for retargeting. It's the same thing on YouTube. you have any kind of presence on YouTube, literally the number one action you could take is just targeting those specific people who have already watched your videos and interacted with your playlists, interacted with your channel, etc.
[18:20]
Those are all great low-hanging fruit actions. Now, the second highest probable action is to target these high intent keywords.
[18:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Relevance in Ad Groups"
NÚMEROS: 2 ad groups principais (starting vs scaling)
VISUAL: Estrutura de ad groups separados por intenção, agrupamento de keywords similares, relevância entre ad group/anúncio/landing page
[18:35]
Now, let me be clear when I talk about the relevance. Okay, relevance means that we take the people and we lump them together into an ad group. An ad group is Google Adwords version of an ad set, the simply put, the place where we do the targeting.
[18:50]
Long story short, if I take all the people who have search terms specific to starting an Amazon business, okay, and I lump them together into an ad group, and then I take all of the search terms that are specific to scaling an Amazon business, and I lump those together, right off the bat, that's defining relevance and giving me an opportunity on the ad level to make videos specific to what those people are searching for.
[19:15]
that is heavily favored in terms of algorithmic weight and distribution of our ad. Being rewarded with lower CPMs, being rewarded with higher placements outside of our bidding, of course, when we have ad relevance to the ad group that we've targeted.
[19:30]
Okay? And then once again, we take that a step further by making a landing page that has relevance to our ad and that has relevance to our ad group.
[19:40] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Relevance Example: Dog Food"
NÚMEROS: 1st, 2nd, 3rd placement positions
VISUAL: Exemplo comparativo de relevância - "healthy dog food" vs "pet food and supplies" vs "cat food", impacto na posição do anúncio e experiência do usuário
[19:45]
An example I always use, I talk about this inside of the master internet marketing class is if I go on YouTube and I search healthy dog food, okay? And then I see an ad that says pet food and pet supplies. It's like technically that's relevant, but it's not as relevant as the ad that says healthy organic dog food or healthy dog food for small dogs.
[20:10]
You know, if I have that additional relevance over the other advertiser that has less relevance, it's a higher probability that my ad reaches people in that first slot there in comparison to being the second or even third slot on the page or worse back than that.
[20:25]
So, long story short, if I search dog food and I see an ad that says cat food, you know, that doesn't it not only doesn't provide me any relevance, that provides me a bad user experience. It literally makes Google and YouTube look bad in that example. That's why relevance is such a heavyweighted metric.
[20:45]
So simply put, we have to be kind of careful with how far we separate out all of our ad groups in terms of the total search volume that we have the ability to target. We don't want to make it too small.
[21:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Ad Group Volume Balance"
NÚMEROS: Poucos milhares de volume mensal como exemplo mínimo
VISUAL: Balanço entre relevância específica e volume escalável, evitar ad groups muito pequenos ou muito amplos
[21:05]
So as an example, if I have specific ad groups defined by here's everybody who wants to start an Amazon business and I pepper a few in there that are a little broader. I'll give you an example, right?
[21:20]
So if I say how to start an Amazon business, how to start an Amazon FBA business, how to start with Amazon arbitrage, how to start with Amazon wholesale, and then I start to add some of those broader terms which are just the words like Amazon arbitrage, Amazon FBA, Amazon wholesale.
[21:40]
Well, those lose a little bit of relevance. Okay, it's obvious distinction there. I don't have the ability to speak to those people about starting as specific as I would for obviously all the terms that talk about starting.
[21:55]
But if I isolate the ones that just talk about starting and let's say I only have a total keyword search volume each month of like a couple thousand, well, that's not going to be a very scalable ad group. I'm not going to be able to put a lot of money towards that through time, but I will be able to provide a lot of relevance to them.
[22:15]
So, we don't want to make our ad group search volumes too small because then they're not going to be scalable, but we don't want to make them too broad that we lose the ability to have ad and landing page relevance.
[22:30]
Put in the chat real quick if that makes sense. Just put a yes if that makes sense. And if you're picking up what I'm putting down, feel free to unmute yourself if you have any questions on this so far. Good. Okay, cool.
[22:45]
So to be clear, all I'm really trying to articulate to you here is very it's very simple. Break out keywords first. Okay? Notice how I'm not talking about doing cold targeting with interests, demographic, and behavior traits.
[23:00]
Okay? Those can be viable and they can definitely work. Not saying they don't work. I'm just saying they're not as high of a probability to work fast in comparison to keywords with high intent search volume.
[23:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Keyword Research Tools Stack"
NÚMEROS: Múltiplas ferramentas mencionadas
VISUAL: Stack de ferramentas - SpyFu para análise competitiva, Keyword.io para geração de keywords, YouTube search para creative analysis
[23:20]
Okay? Keywords with high intent search volume much higher probability to work. So use competitive analysis tools. There's also great tools like keyword.io that can function as very specific keyword uh analyzers for ads to compile you lists a little faster based on terms that you search outside of what spy spyfu provides.
[23:40]
Spyfu for me is much more of a competitive analysis tool. And then obviously just use YouTube itself. Go to YouTube and just search all the different terms that you want to compile with your keywords. That way you get creative analysis.
[23:55]
Okay? Because once again the creative analysis helps cut the edge of the creative iteration testing cycle that's necessary on YouTube in terms of expectations which are very important to set with YouTube.
[24:10] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "YouTube Creative Expectations"
NÚMEROS: 30 segundos a vários minutos, 30 minutos máximo visto, 2min30s sweet spot
VISUAL: Expectativas de teste criativo no YouTube vs outras plataformas, baixa taxa de sucesso ao rolar criativos de Facebook/Instagram
[24:15]
Whenever we have a client or a student or anybody really that wants to get onto YouTube, we always tell them the same thing. We're like, "Look, you you can't like one of the worst things you could do is just roll whatever is working on Facebook and Instagram for you onto YouTube."
[24:30]
That typically that typically has a very low probability of working. very low hit rate. Very low hit rate. What has a higher probability to work is making YouTube specific videos.
[24:45]
Okay. Now, you have to keep in mind typically a good YouTube ad is anywhere from as low as 30 seconds all the way up to several minutes long. I've had clients that have ran 30 minute YouTube ads, but they're extremely valuable.
[25:00]
They essentially take what the webinar would otherwise have been and they put it right there into the YouTube video and they do some hyperspecific targeting. That way, once again, that long ad provides just as much value as whatever video that person was there to watch in the first place.
[25:20]
Okay. Now, the point I'm attempting to make, I typically tell clients, keep the YouTube ads under 2 minutes and 30 seconds. That seems to be the sweet spot historically for us where we get a good view rate.
[25:35]
And it's important to note, they're not there to watch the ad. If you do a good enough job with your YouTube video, you've essentially interrupted what the person was there to otherwise watch and you've captured their attention to get them to watch your ad instead of the video that they were there to consume.
[25:55] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "The 5-Second Skip Window"
NÚMEROS: 5 segundos antes do botão skip aparecer
VISUAL: Comportamento do usuário com dedo/mouse sobre botão skip, necessidade de hook poderoso nos primeiros 5 segundos
[26:00]
And that's tough to do because remember, you have 5 seconds and skippable ads before they jump over it to the next one. So, a lot of the lessons that I've seen distributed about opening hooks on Tik Tok in particular, I think are extremely applicable to YouTube advertising.
[26:20]
So, if you've studied in any way, shape, or form how an opening hook should look to get people to sit there and consume a Tik Tok or a real, then that that set of lessons rolls directly over to how the opening hook of a YouTube video should be.
[26:35]
You have to capture people's attention. You have to remember, think about your own behavior. You know, if you don't pay for YouTube Premium and you still have YouTube ads that get served to you, it's like most of the time when I'm there to watch a specific video, I'm just sitting there with my thumb hovering over the shit skip ad button and I'm ready to press that button as soon as I get the opportunity to do so.
[26:55]
And that's how most people are going to operate. They're hovering their mouse or their thumb right over that button, ready to press it. So you you're dealing with that level of behavior and you've got that 5-second window to be able to capture their attention.
[27:10]
So, even though you have 2 minutes and 30 seconds, you know, for an average length of an ad, that's typically going to work well, you you got to do the first 5 seconds exceptionally well. You really got to capture the attention and sell them on continuing to watch that video.

Okay. Now, the worst things to possibly do just as a few like do not do these. Don't be one of those shits that says stop, pay attention. That shit never works. And people get a dopamine rush from skipping a video like that.
[27:45]
Okay? People shit hate guys like you if you do that shit shit never works. Okay? It's annoying and it has once again one of the lowest probabilities to actually get somebody to sit there and continue watching.

[28:05]
You get somebody to stop and watch by having a strong opening hook. So once again, back to the example I provided, which is Andrew's course on how to start an Amazon business. If I've searched how to start an Amazon business, what do you guys think would be the best opening hook to use in the first 5 seconds of a video for a person who's watching a shit video about how starting an Amazon business works?

It'd probably be smart for me to talk about starting an Amazon business and how it works. You know, I'm going to give you in under two minutes five tips on how to start your Amazon business. Here's five mistakes I've made on starting an Amazon business.
[28:45]
My Amazon business makes $100,000 a month. Here's five things I wish I did differently when I was first getting started. You know, like 5-second hooks about what the person is there to watch. Contextual hooks. Okay, remember that. Contextual 5-second hooks.
[29:05]
That shit lands exceptionally well. And like I said, it's the same set of lessons that you'd otherwise apply to a Tik Tok. And typically, to be fair, with Tik Tok, you have less time than what you'd otherwise have on YouTube. At least on YouTube, they're forced to watch 5 seconds of it.
[29:25]
So anyway, I digress. Point I'm attempting to make, make sure that you do not roll your videos over from other ad platforms. You have to make YouTube specific creatives.
[29:35]
A lot of businesses we work with, simply put, they don't necessarily prioritize making creatives as often as they should. And to be fair, they generally don't have to. You know, you could make five to six videos for Facebook, Instagram, or Tik Tok, and once again, there's a very high probability that they'll just work.
[29:55] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "YouTube Creative Volume Reality"
NÚMEROS: 5-6 vídeos podem precisar ser refilmados em 1 semana
VISUAL: Comparação de volume criativo necessário - YouTube exige muito mais iterações e testes que outras plataformas
[30:00]
You don't get that benefit on YouTube. YouTube, you might create like five to six two-minute videos and you might have to refilm them again in like a week if they don't start hitting right away.
[30:15]
So, there's a much higher volume of creative that's typically necessary in order to maximize the revenue that you're going to produce off of YouTube advertising efforts. Okay? It's a little bit more frustrating and it takes a little bit longer and a little bit more of a burn in terms of money spent before it starts working in order to maximize YouTube.
[30:35] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "YouTube Long-Term Benefits"
NÚMEROS: Troca de criativos a cada 1-3 meses em outras plataformas vs raramente no YouTube
VISUAL: Benefícios de longo prazo - canal escalável, consistente, sem fadiga de anúncio, não precisa trocar criativos frequentemente
[30:40]
Once again, benefits of going through that cycle. Soon as it starts to work, you get a very scalable channel that's very consistent and very rarely will fatigue. It's important to note that very rarely will you have to go through and change out your ads once you get something that lands and works unlike the other ad channels where you have to typically cycle through new creatives on conversion optimized campaigns every month to maybe every 3 months max depending on levels of spend sometimes faster than that depending on levels of spend.
[31:10] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Low Hanging Fruit #3: Video/Channel Targeting"
NÚMEROS: #3 ação mais provável, apenas Video View objective (não conversão)
VISUAL: Estratégia de targeting específico de vídeos e canais, oportunidade criativa contextual, limitação de objetivo de campanha
[31:15]
So moral of the story the other cool thing you could do on YouTube that I've really enjoyed but they don't allow you to run it as a conversion event anymore. you can only run it as a video view event is being able to target specific videos and specific channels.
[31:30]
This is another opportunity where I think it's a very undermined opportunity. I'd consider it the third highest probable action in terms of what can work where it gives you a lot of creative freedom and it gives you a lot of opportunity to be contextual because no other channel gives you the ability to target to a specific video.
[31:50]
Okay, Tik Tok in some instances depending on the size of the channel itself does give you the ability to target like a page. But it's important to note YouTube when you do a video view objective, okay, so unfortunately not a conversion objective, but a video view objective will give you the functionality all the way down to a specific video or a specific channel to target videos onto that person's page or onto that person's specific video.
[32:20]
Now obviously in terms of the exact same conversation I just had in terms of keyword ad group relevance the same thing applies in terms of this video strategy. We get the opportunity here to clump together either a group of videos or sometimes one to two very high traffic single videos and simply put we get the opportunity to provide relevance on our ad and on our landing page specific to that person's videos.
[32:45]
So, this is also great when it comes to competitive analysis. It's it's another thing that you kind of get to do at the same time outside of just looking at ad videos, just compiling competitor landing pages, looking in spyfu, looking in keyword.io.
[33:00]
Um, gives you an opportunity to look at what organically is ranking high and potentially compiling a list of dozens or even just a handful of high traffic videos. And remember, a bunch of small videos in combination can still provide a good healthy, you know, larger set of people to target on a month-to-month basis.
[33:20]
And same logic, we want to compile all those into a specific ad group. We want to have ads that are specific to that specific set of videos or channels that we're targeting. And we just want to make sure that we're compiling them in a way that's relevant. That's all it comes down to.
[33:35]
Third highest probable action in terms of what works. Very rarely used once again because it's under a video view objective rather than a conversion objective.
[33:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Video View Objective Strategy"
NÚMEROS: Vídeos mais longos possíveis, 30 segundos de intro + webinar/VSL completo
VISUAL: Otimização para visualizações vs conversões, oportunidade de rodar vídeos mais longos, necessidade de CTAs fortes
[33:50]
So important to note the videos creative performance obviously is dictated there uh at a heavier weight because you're optimizing for video views rather than conversions. So same videos can be used in terms of typical direct response ads. You just have to make sure you're very heavy on the call to actions throughout it because it's not going to get in front of people who are probable to convert. It's going to get in front of people who are probable to watch the video.
[34:15]
Now to be fair in some instances that's good because that gives us the ability to run longer videos. Anytime that we've historically done a video view objective targeting specific videos or channels, we will attempt to test the same two and a half minute YouTube videos against some longer form videos.
[34:35]
Um, if we have a client that has a webinar or or some type of VSSL that's very well run and optimized, what we will do is we will have a hook that we attach to the beginning of it like a 30 second intro.

NÚMEROS: 30 segundos de hook + webinar completo
VISUAL: Exemplo de Tai Lopez - hook externo na frente da casa, transição para conteúdo interno com whiteboard, técnica de stitching de vídeos
[34:55]
And a great example of this, we did this with uh uh Tai Lopez is a good example of this where I don't know if you guys remember this from a couple years ago where Tai has a video where like he's in front of his house and he's saying something along the lines in the first 30 seconds of this YouTube video.
[35:15]
Hey, I'm going to teach you guys like the three tips about, you know, starting up a SMMA business. And um you know, these three tips are shit things that I think would help you a lot if you're just getting started.
[35:30]
Uh we'll go inside. I got a nice whiteboard and you know I'll go through all this stuff with you guys if you're interested just you know keep watching the video and he's like slowly backing into the front door of his house and then that's kind of where the ad ends and then you click through to the page and it's Tai in the living room there in the house with the whiteboard and he just dives right into the content.
[35:55]
That'd be an example of a way you could do that where you actually stitch both together and just run it as a video of you add in that example towards specific videos or channels.
[36:05]
Um point is YouTube allows for a lot of creativity, a lot of contextual creativity. Okay? And when you or your clients are willing to go the extra mile to provide contextual videos that are relevant to the people that you're targeting, it performs exceptionally well.

NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Mentalidade necessária - não pode ser preguiçoso, precisa esforço extra, trabalhar mais que competidores
[36:30]
Simply put, it is not a lazy man's game. You cannot be a lazy advertiser and have a lot of success on YouTube. Um, it's important to note you can generate solid returns with some of the broad targeting options like demographic, interest, and behavior traits on YouTube.
[36:50]
Just like any other channel, you got to go through the same creative iterations that I just talked about. That expectation does not supersede by any means.
[37:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "4th Order Action: Adjacent Keywords"
NÚMEROS: #4 prioridade de ação
VISUAL: Estratégia de keywords adjacentes - um passo além dos termos diretos, exemplo Amazon vs Shopify/ecommerce
[37:05]
However, one thing that's important to note in terms like a fourth order action, if you're going through the creative cycle already and you have kind of maxed out those smaller subsets of search terms that people are looking for, the keywords and you're ready to go a little broader, don't just go into broad demographic interests and behaviors.
[37:25]
Next, what I'd encourage you to do is just look at keywords that are one step further away from what you're targeting. So, as an example for Andrew's how to start an Amazon course, how to start an Amazon business course, one step further away from literally searching how to start an Amazon business would be how to start an e-commerce business or like Shopify search terms like how to do XYZ on Shopify or how to start a Shopify business or why should why should I use Shopify versus shit Magento or some shit you know?
[37:55]
The point is one step further away from your ideal high intent search terms are technically high intent search terms that just don't directly relate to what you do where you get an opportunity to convince people on why what you're talking about is better than whatever it is that they're potentially searching for and trying to do.
[38:15]
So if I wanted to start a Shopify business, I might be able to convince somebody who's searching that specific term why starting an Amazon business is a better opportunity. Simply put, so moral of the story, don't go broad with demographic interests and behaviors first.
[38:35]
Try to just take that step back with high intent keywords that just don't directly relate to your niche. And then remember, you still have to go through that same creative iteration process. You still have to go through the opportunity to cycle through some different videos, see what's going to work.
[38:50]
Obviously, make specific videos for those ideas. And once again, for the for the ad group that you've chosen to target, you got to make videos that are contextual to them to outrank everybody else. Just go the extra mile.
[39:05] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "The Extra Mile Mentality"
NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Frame mental vencedor - trabalhar mais que competidores, filmar vídeos extras que outros não farão, esforço adicional = dominação do nicho
[39:10]
Simply put, on YouTube, the best thing that you can keep in terms of mental frame the entire time is I'm going to be working harder than the advertiser I'm competing against. I'm willing to shoot those extra videos that the lazy advertiser is not.
[39:25]
Okay? I'm willing to go the extra mile. I'm willing to add a little more effort in comparison to what I'd otherwise have to do on other channels. You go that extra mile, I mean, you're going to shit own that specific subset, that niche from how few other advertisers out there are willing to compete against you.
[39:45]
Um, especially after they've already been in the game for a while and have got their campaigns, their ad groups, and their ads all set up. And, you know, once again, they've just kind of gotten a little lazy. They're not fresh and new where they're willing to put all that effort and attention into it.
[40:00]
Okay, does this all make sense? Does anybody have questions on any of this? Feel free to unmute yourself if you do. Cool.

NÚMEROS: Dezenas/centenas de milhares por mês antes de YouTube, 3ª plataforma típica
VISUAL: Ordem de prioridade de plataformas - Facebook/Instagram primeiro, depois TikTok, então Google Adwords PPC + YouTube simultâneo
[40:15]
So, just to reiterate, YouTube's a shit phenomenal ad platform. By no means is it the first channel that we go after. YouTube's typically something we do when we're ready to scale. YouTube's something that we add in when we're already spending tens of thousands or or sometimes even hundreds of thousands of dollars a month nowadays.
[40:35]
We typically go Facebook, Instagram, then Tik Tok, then we'll jump into Google Adwords with PPC ads and YouTube at the same time. We never use the display network. We think the display network's absolute trash.
[40:50]
Um, historically has never done better than break even for like any business I've ever seen. I challenge you to show me an advertiser that's ever been highly profitable other than retargeting ads with the display network. I'd love to see them, but moral of the story is typically a third platform that will that will spend into.
[41:10]
And the main reason being it just takes a little more effort. That's really it. Most clients aren't willing to put that effort in until they've got a strong ROAS otherwise and they're ready to diversify away from being a one-legged stool.

[41:30]
So, it's a great action to take if you're in that position. It's a great action to take if you're somebody like Andrew as an example. Andrew is making almost all his money from Instagram and even worse from Instagram DMs.
[41:45]
And he had a competitor targeting his shit page and taking it down every other day. Now it's been stable again, which is great. But at the same time, obviously, he has a strong incentive to divest away from it and make other things work.
[42:00]
Um, that could be a great opportunity once again in terms of why you should be taking action on YouTube now. And uh in other instances, you just already got a strong YouTube organic presence and you've just never tapped those channels, those remarketing audiences and run ads towards it.
[42:20]
That's also a huge opportunity in terms of some low hanging fruit ROAS right there that's right in front of your face. You're just not doing it.

Um you have to once again in terms of caveats here, you have to be willing to put in that additional effort. You have to be willing to put in the extra work on creatives. You know, you got to be willing to film more often than what you otherwise are now.
[42:50]
And uh simply put, it's very important once again that your client or whoever is shooting the videos very clearly understands who those videos are going to get in front of.
[43:00]
Don't separate out the research that you've done as the advertiser from what the client is going to understand. You have to make sure that those two are on the same page. You got to show your client, hey, this specific video we're about to that we're about to film is targeting these specific people who search these terms.
[43:20]
Every time I do that, the videos come out a lot better than what they otherwise would have if we kept the client in the dark on them. So, just keep all that in mind.
[43:30]

Um, the quote that I've been given is about 10k a year or up to $3 million in coverage and up to $1 million per claim. And it includes $100,000 of PR crisis management where there'd be no deductible. But for everything else, the deductible's 5K.
[45:00]
So you'd spend you'd pay the first 5K and then you covered up to a million dollars per claim and up to $3 million a year. And it's 10K a year that we'd have to put. Does that sound high, reasonable, standard to anyone here who's been looking at business insurance?

It sounds a little high. U typically every every uh $1,200 to $2,000 that you spend is about a million dollar in liability insurance with about the same deductible of about five grand.
[45:40]
I've been quoted occasionally a deductible of 7,500 with that same price range of like the $1,200 to $2,000 on an on an annual basis per million. It's not too far off though.
[45:55]
The reason that you might be at 10K, just a little higher than what I think it'd otherwise be, is that crisis management rider that it sounds like you talked about there. Um, I mean, it sounds overall fair, but but like a little bit higher than what I've otherwise been quoted.
[46:15]
Does anybody else have anything they want to add who's recently gotten insurance? All right. Yeah.
[46:20]
All right. All right. Thank you. Appreciate that.
[46:25]
No problem.
[46:30]
So, it doesn't seem unreasonable. It seems reasonable enough. Yeah.
[46:35]
Yeah. I mean, a little higher than what what I think you what you'd otherwise pay, but I mean, at the same time, you know, it's not too far off than what you should pay. For sure. It's not it's not it's not unfair where it's like, wow, that's crazy.
[46:50]
Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Just another question. It's relevant to the YouTube thing. Um, I'm gonna be writing a book as a lead magnet, self-publishing, and I'm wondering whether I could use that same strategy that you just outlined in terms of keyword research to come up with the perfect name for the book which would get the most number of clicks when I do advertising.

Yeah. If uh to be clear, I've only had one person in like the history. He he was like a he made almost all his money on ebooks and he was mainly like an Amazon ebook seller.
[47:35]
And one pro tip that this guy gave me and I've literally never seen anybody implement it since was based on the search terms that would be what the title of the book was.
[47:50]
And since it was a digital cover of the book anyway and a digital copy of the book, the content of the book didn't change at all. just the cover of the book and he would like have a version of it that he'd be holding in his hand and that was digitally altered every time based on what the search terms were inside of the YouTube ads that he would run and it was it was like one of the most creative things I've ever seen.
[48:15]
Obviously had a really high conversion rate because everybody who searched for whatever they were looking at like the name of the shit book was pretty much exactly what they were searching for. So really, really high opt-in rate.
[48:30]
And then when the book showed up on their door, it would have a different title to it. So it would just look like
[48:35]
that's the thing. So like it was just a digital book for him. So the book like, you know, it was it was able to get altered in real time. There was there was no physical book to it.

Got it. Yeah. I'm I'm looking to do a physical book. And I remember Tim Ferriss talked about the fact that he tested 12 different book titles before he realized that the 4-hour work week was the one that got the the highest clickthrough rate by a lot.
[49:15]
So I'm was just trying to figure out as I set forth here how I would do something similar to to test uh book titles ahead of time so I can come up with the book title which would give us the most traffic.
[49:30]
Yeah. Keep in mind it'll be a little skewed if you if you you know create audiences and then book titles specific to those audiences because then you're really just playing into the audience in general and not doing like a true split test of what everybody would otherwise respond to, you know?
[49:50]
Yeah. And then just back on the YouTube stuff that you just presented, um the third version you said which was target key videos or target channels.
[50:00]
Yeah. You said that that is the third most effective. So it's not the most effective, it's kind of down the pecking order. Is that right?
[50:10]
Yeah. Because the objective that you have to select is a video view objective and not a conversion objective. So sometimes that one nuance difference in how you actually optimize a campaign gets you in front of a completely different demographic of people that aren't otherwise probable to convert.

So, I could then go and target that particular video and say, "Show my ad to anyone who watched that video."
[51:00]
Yeah. Exactly. And you and anybody who goes and watches that video in the future, your ad would be in front of it.
[51:10]
Yeah. It's really cool. I mean, but it's very heavy on the creative in order to get it to work. So, simply put, you just have to keep in mind like sometimes there's very high traffic single videos that you can run by itself.
[51:25]
Other times it's like there's, you know, three dozen little tens of thousands of views videos that might get like 10k views between them in a month that you've got to, you know, you can't be as specific as you otherwise would with a video that's got, you know, shit 20 million views and and continues to get more and more viewership.
[51:45]
uh you know by the week and by the day. Um those videos allow a lot more creativity when they're like the single high traffic videos because you know exactly what the video is.
