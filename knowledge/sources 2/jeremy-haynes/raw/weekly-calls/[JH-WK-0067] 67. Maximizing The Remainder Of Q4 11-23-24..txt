Transcrição Completa: 67 Maximizing The Remainder Of Q4 11 23 24
[00:00] Okay, so halfway through uh through Q4, not just in Q4, Black Swan Q4 where we already overcame the election cycle. Holy shit was that a doozy? Um to be clear now, we're in the thick of it where we got Black Friday and Cyber Monday coming up this next week and we're getting questions.
[00:20] Uh what should we do? So, first of all, there's two things we're going to cover inside of this group call today. Number one being what are you going to do this upcoming week specifically? Um, I'm going to talk from a perspective of two things. Number one, maximizing the Black Friday, Cyber Monday time frame, but also ensuring that you don't waste spend if you're running any kind of lead gen call funnel where you're intending to sell something high ticket and it requires you to get people on the phone.
[00:50] Um, in addition to that, we're going to be talking about what to do for the remainder of Q4 and just make sure that you guys have a battle plan for that stuff. That way, you're uh well prepared.
[01:02] Um, to be clear, let's start off with what to do this upcoming week. So, put in the chat what's probable to happen this upcoming week starting Wednesday. If you are running a call funnel or anything where you need to be in communication with somebody to sell them, what's going to start happening? Throw it in the chat.
[01:25] Call cancellations, stalls, and shit ass show rates. [laughter] Yeah, that's a that's a good summary right there. It's good synopsis of what's probable to occur.

NÚMEROS: Wednesday onwards
VISUAL: Representação de calendário semanal destacando queda de performance, ícones de cancelamento e baixas taxas de comparecimento
[01:40] So, there's a few things that we could do. Number one, incentives. Okay, there's two types of clients that we usually have during this time frame and what their preferences kind of dictates what we're probable to do.
[01:55] If somebody's willing to discount their service or discount their products during this specific time frame, then we have incentives that we offer to buyers on the days where they are not probable to show up in order to show up. These are usually discounts on the cost and you can essentially call it a Black Friday or Cyber Monday offer in order to get the person to show up.
[02:20] Most people that are in the world going to visit their families or having people come to them are going to be traveling essentially sometime between like Tuesday and Wednesday. Most probable to be Wednesday. That way they can be there on the day of Thanksgiving on Thursday.
[02:38] And then generally people will take off hang out with their families over the weekends if they're actively participating in this uh seasonal event. Okay. So again incentives control behavior.
[02:50] All right. I need to make people aware that if they show up for a call they schedule during that time frame, we will offer them X for doing so. And it has to be something good. I want to be very clear when I say this. It can't just be like some frivolous shit that people don't actually care about.
[03:08] It has to be like either a steep enough discount to get somebody to show up or something that you can add to it that again somebody would actually appreciate and care about.
[03:18] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Incentive Strategy Example"
NÚMEROS: $10,000 offer, $2,500 discount, $7,500 final price
VISUAL: Cálculo comparativo mostrando preço original vs preço com desconto, setas indicando matemática de conversão considerando comissões de vendas
[03:20] Few examples of this like let's use let's use the example you have a $10,000 offer and you can get somebody uh $2,500 off. Okay, I want to help you understand. You wouldn't make the $10,000 minus the sales commissions to capture that $7,500 minus sales commissions would still be more money than what you're otherwise probable to lose by having a bunch of no-shows on that specific day.
[03:50] As an example, although it sounds steep as a discount, regardless, it does dramatically increase the probability that somebody's actually going to show up and buy.
[04:00] You have to be excessively clear on this that it's only for the days where you are probable to get fucked on your show rate. Okay? So, as an example, that could be Wednesday, that could be Thursday, that could even be Friday. And again, you call it a Black Friday deal.
[04:18] And true scarcity would be implied here that this actually does stop from the point that you are going to experience regular show rates onward, which is essentially from the following week forward up until the Christmas time frame.
[04:32] Um or some of the Jewish holidays for everybody out there that's Jewish. You got some of that coming up in early December. Point I'm trying to make, I want to be clear in saying incentives control behavior.
[04:45] I also want to be clear in saying that if somebody does not take you up on the incentive that you're going to technically burn that lead, okay? Because again, if I offer somebody a discount and they later want to buy it anyway, but they have to buy it for a higher price. if they don't genuinely want it and they still have to be sold, there's a lower probability they purchase at a later time.
[05:08] So, you're essentially clearing out the people in that stage of the pipeline. So, you want to make sure you only communicate it to the people who are literally doing calls on that day anyway. Okay, does that make sense?

NÚMEROS: Não especificado numericamente
VISUAL: Lista de opções alternativas incluindo preview de upsells, one-on-one calls de 15 minutos, produtos adicionais, ícones representando valor agregado
[05:25] Okay. Um, to be clear on just kind of wrapping this up from an incentive perspective, it doesn't have to be a discount. Could also just be something that you want to add to it that people genuinely give a shit about. This could be like a preview of an upsell program as an example for a couple weeks or you know whatever predefined timeline you want some other product that you have that you add to it.
[05:48] Um sometimes as an example uh you can add like a one-on-one call for a short duration in time. You like 15-minute one-on-one call with somebody if they buy a specific product. You know, again something that people would truly want. Doesn't have to be anything crazy but incentives. Okay, think with incentives.
[06:10] Now, secondary to that, we have clients that in no way, shape, or form want to discount what they sell and in no way, shape, or form want to add additional things to it. And that's fine, too.
[06:22] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Scale Back Strategy - No Discount Approach"
NÚMEROS: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday onwards, Wednesday-Friday blackout window
VISUAL: Calendário mostrando estratégia de redução gradual de volume de calls, zonas de blackout destacadas, gráfico de diminuição de spend
[06:25] For those people, we just scale back essentially from about tomorrow. So, we'll try to generate the same quantity of calls for Monday, Tuesday, and still into Wednesday, but we know Wednesday onward is going to be pretty vital.
[06:40] So, we essentially just limit the quantity of people that are able to book called a blackout window from the second half of Wednesday through Thursday and Friday.
[06:52] Um, I want to be clear in saying almost everybody's going to be implying that there's some kind of sale or discount going on if they do book a call on Friday. Um, put in the chat real quick if this has ever happened to you. If people do historically book calls with you on Friday or talk with your organization on Black Friday, do they show up thinking that there's just going to be a discount or something for them or do they treat it like it's just going to be a regular, you know, they're buying it for what the normal price is.
[07:25] Has that ever happened to you? Put in the chat yes or no. Unfortunately, it's kind of like an imply, it's like an implication, you know? It's like people will show up just thinking, well, hey, it's Black Friday. You know, it's a macro event.
[07:40] It's like, as an example, if I talked to you on Christmas, I would expect you to say to me, "Merry Christmas." You know what I mean? If I talk to you on Thanksgiving, I'd probably expect you to say, "Happy Thanksgiving." If I show up and talk to your organization on Black Friday, I'd probably expect you to offer me a discount.
[08:00] So, is it worth potentially talking to people on Friday who are essentially going to show up and just say like, "Hey, I want a discount." Well, it is again if you have some kind of incentive for them. Uh not so much in the instance that you're not going to participate.
[08:15] So, in addition to that, you have your closers to deal with. Uh, put in the chat yes or no. Have you guys talked to your closers about their availability yet for this second half of the week? Yes, you have. No, you have not.
[08:30] Yeah, good to see. Good to see most of you are. To be clear, there's plenty of organizations that we work with where their closers are already putting in notice saying like, "Hey, you know, like I'm out." they're they're out from shit Wednesday through the weekend, you know, and they're not taking calls.

NÚMEROS: 50% closers take off, 50% closers work through holidays
VISUAL: Gráfico de pizza dividido ao meio mostrando disponibilidade de closers, ícones de calendário e calculadora representando closer math
[08:50] So So again, when you do closer math, you got to factor in availability in this case. You got to factor in the the macro environment here for whether people are actually probable to convert or not on these specific days. And you're probably going to need to ease up the spend a little bit regardless unless, again, you have some kind of discount or incentive that you're going to be able to offer people.
[09:15] Um, for most organizations, we're seeing about half of the closers completely take off and about half the closers say they don't give a shit about the holidays, you know, like I'm just going to take calls anyway. I want to make money.
[09:30] So, I my my personal bias and what I push people towards is there's still people out there that, you know, just don't really care about this kind of stuff and they're happy to show up and just like do their regular routines and schedules and and they're happy to buy.
[09:45] So, I'm not telling you you need to like literally black out the calendars and not take calls at all. But um yeah, you gota you got to make sure that people are going to be confirmed ahead of time.

NÚMEROS: Não especificado numericamente
VISUAL: Fluxograma de comunicação proativa, mensagens de confirmação, script de verificação de disponibilidade
[10:02] Your show rate sequencing is probably going to look a little different these next couple days. You have to essentially reach out to people proactively and be like, "Uh, hey man, saw you booked a call on Wednesday. Just want to make sure you're not traveling anywhere that day and that you're actually going to show up."
[10:20] You know, surprisingly, some people book calls with us and they forget they have a flight or something. Uh haha. You know, uh just kind of double confirm that there's somebody who's again just kind of not subscribing to the holidays and they're happy to buy anyway.
[10:35] Or if you have a closer as an example that's literally going to take calls on Thanksgiving. Same kind of logic. You have to switch the show rate sequencing to be, hey, what's going on? Saw you booked a call on Thanksgiving.
[10:50] Um, I'm happy to take the call to be clear. We we love helping people out and we don't want to delay helping you with uh what we do over here, but I just want to make sure you know you know you booked it on Thanksgiving. Sometimes people mistakenly do that in a rush. Uh, are you cool to show up on that day?
[11:10] you know, that's the kind of uh communication that you want to be putting out to people for anybody that does book on these specific days. Okay?
[11:18] And remember, if you do the incentive on top of that, after they respond, you can also tell them, "By the way, just as a kind of thank you and a reward, you know, to encourage you to actually show up and uh make a make a choice on this particular day, we're doing this as a as an appreciation incentive, you know, something like that."
[11:40] Okay, real quick before I continue. Does this make sense so far? Everybody? Everybody understand what I'm saying?

VISUAL: Gráfico de linha descendente mostrando redução progressiva de spend, tabela comparativa de volume de calls, timeline de scaling
[11:50] Okay. So, from my perspective in terms of like a tactical example, uh we have a client that's spending upwards of $5,500 a day on a call funnel. We get anywhere from 40 to 60 calls a day at that rate.
[12:05] Um half their closers are out. Uh over these last couple days, I've slowly scaled down because right now we're already booking into Wednesday. As of today on Saturday, while I'm talking to you, I've already gone from uh 5,500 down to 4,000.
[12:25] By Monday, I will be at sub 3,000. I'll probably be at like 2500 to 3,000. The other half of the closers that'll stay on the calendars, that'll sustain them and that'll give them the volume that they need through those days.
[12:40] And we've done training calls with these closing teams to do exactly what we just talked about. Encourage them to communicate in specific ways. Um, confirm way ahead of time, not the day of the call.
[12:55] Uh, you know, again, like once the call comes in, almost like a hey, did you make a mistake? [laughter] Just want to make sure that uh you know what's happening on those days. You know, you don't have any travel coming up or anything, right? You know, that kind of communication.
[13:15] So, all right. Cool. Questions on this? Feel free to unmute yourself and ask. Otherwise,
[13:22] PARTICIPANTE: I got a question. When you're scaling back the ad spend, are you literally just going down in budget or are you killing stuff that's not performing as well?
[13:32] No, just just peeling it back. So, in that example, we go from like 5,500 a day to like 5,000 to 4500 to like 4,000 3500. Uh I think I made one jump that was like a thousand down. you you can jump down pretty dramatically without real ramifications. Jumping up is typically where you can experience some uh some negative ramifications.
[14:00] Once once uh Thursday happens, I'll start the process of scaling it back up to the 5500. That way by Sunday I'll be I'll be back up at that level of spend so the following week is not impacted.
[14:15] PARTICIPANTE: Okay, that was my question. Thank you.
[14:18] No problem. Other questions?
[14:25] Okay, cool. Um, now to be clear, sometimes, you know, you realize it's going to be a fucked up week. You didn't necessarily plan ahead and you don't regularly run any kind of Black Friday or Cyber Monday offers, but you know, you want to participate in the uh potential upside of the money holiday.

NÚMEROS: Last 2-3 years
VISUAL: Timeline mostrando mudança na percepção de Black Friday, gráfico comparativo mostrando diluição do evento ao longo do mês de novembro, ícones de scam vs ofertas legítimas
[14:48] So, allow me to make sure that you potentially maximize that as well, just in case you still don't have a plan. Um, look, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are days that people expect to spend money. These last, tell me if you guys disagree, by the way. These last like two or three years, I've noticed that Black Friday and Cyber Monday is essentially like the entire month of November now.
[15:15] And it doesn't feel as special as it used to. You know, it doesn't hold the same charm. There's not necessarily like as steep of discounts as what there historically was. And honestly, these last two or three years specifically, it kind of feels like especially the big corporations, they've almost been like scamming on Black Friday, you know, where they just like mark things up and they discount it down to like right around the regular price that it usually sells for anyway.
[15:45] Um, can you put in the chat yes, you agree or no, you disagree? Again, do you agree? Yes. that Black Friday is not as special as it was and that people are just kind of, you know, doing it the entire month, you know, not discounting things as steep as they were.
[16:05] Okay. So, what you can do is if you do have an actual like special Black Friday offer, I am subscribed to the idea that there is never been like a better year to really have a standout Black Friday offer. like something that's truly special, something that people would look at and say, "Holy shit like that's a real Black Friday offer right there. That's not a scam Black Friday offer." Okay?
[16:30] And I think that you'd get a lot of attention and revenue off of that within that short duration of time.

VISUAL: Timeline de pre-venda mostrando aumento progressivo de preço, gráfico de receita vs tempo de produção, estratégia de early bird discount
[16:40] Now, I am a big fan of taking something that does not exist and selling it before it does. Okay? I remember back in the day, this is way back in the day when I worked at Grant Cardone's office. We had we called it u it was like mastering cold calling or something like that some some like cold calling course and we pre-sold it on black we started it on black Friday if I if I remember correctly and sold it for I want to say a couple hundred bucks initially and we made if I'm not mistaken a couple hundred grand off that in this pre-sale
[17:20] Grant didn't even film it for a good like six months and as we kept getting closer to like when we actually thought it would be filmed and when it would get We just kept raising the price. That way, the people who bought it at its earliest before it existed knew that they truly got a good deal.
[17:38] And again, as it got closer and closer to actually releasing, uh, the price was at its full price of like a couple thousand dollars.
[17:48] And to be very direct, although some people think, you know, from almost like an ethics perspective, like it's almost like unethical to sell something that doesn't exist yet, as though it does. Um, you just got to be very clear with people. It's a pre-order. you know, it's a pre-order discount to something that you're eventually going to create.
[18:10] And if it goes well and you do make a good sum of money off of it, it's a great incentive in order to push into that product line and to create it. And in the instance that it doesn't go well and it's like a marginal amount of money, you can just refund everybody and, you know, take the small hit on like a couple hundred in fees for whatever the refund is going to cost and uh, you know, give people their money back and just not do it at all.
[18:35] So, it gives you a it gives you a really good way to be able to pre-sell something that again is is a it's a tremendous way to be able to create upside on that day that you might not otherwise have captured.

VISUAL: Pacote de produtos antigos, comparação de preço histórico vs bundle price, estratégia de separate payment processor
[18:52] Um, I also want to be clear in saying it's a great day to discount old stuff that you're not selling anymore. So, as an example, uh, let's use my info product ecosystem as an example. Okay, I have high ticket agency which is the newest, latest and greatest here's how to start and scale a marketing agency course that we have. That's the one that we update. That's the one we creating content for.
[19:20] Um, we have old versions of that which are the DMM, the digital marketing manuscript and same concept teaches people to start and scale marketing agencies, but last I updated that was probably like 2019. And to be clear, the information in it is still very good, very valid. But sometimes people have a disconnect in okay well this information wasn't filmed like yesterday you know is it still valid information.
[19:48] We could take our old courses just using that as an example amongst many others. Bundle them all up. We probably have like five or six of those. Come up with like a little $500 offer and sell the living shit out of it for something that we literally don't even sell anymore and discount it down.
[20:10] Give people some still great information. Get some more people into the ecosystem. Treat it like a low ticket offer that is going to convert people in because all our other low ticket offers nowadays for the info product education company are all 5K. So get people in for a couple hundred bucks.
[20:30] We would use a separate payment processor for this. We would not use our main payment processor because not that people are probable to charge back, but every time in the info product space that you sell something for only a couple hundred, you get the pirates that come in, buy the product, will charge it back, and will fucking pimp it out and just pirate the shit out of it. Okay?
[20:55] Okay, you got to be mindful of that. You want to use a separate payment processor. But again, easy way to just create money out of thin air on something that we don't even sell anymore. Again, pre-sell something that doesn't exist, potentially refund it in the instance that it does not sell well enough.
[21:15] Or two, we're going to bundle a bunch of shit up that's old that we don't regularly sell anymore, and we're going to sell that for a for a steep discount in comparison to what it's historically sold for. Does this make sense?

[21:35] Okay. I also want to be clear and saying it's almost like a status symbol to not participate in Black Friday at all, which is uh more so what I'm personally subscribed to myself. Um I I use it as a like look, you're not going to fucking Louis Vuitton. You're not going to Ferrari and getting a discount on Black Friday, Cyber Monday, okay?
[22:00] They don't give a shit about those holidays. They they essentially use these days to affirm where they are as a brand, okay? To tell people get fucked
[22:12] You guys ever see articles? I just saw an article the other day from Burberry where it said Burberry burned more than $120 million in inventory that didn't sell rather than giving it away rather than putting it on homeless folks. Okay, rather than doing a charitable donation, rather than discounting it to people, okay, they fucking burned it and they wrote an article about it and put it in a press release.
[22:40] What do you think that does perceptually to Burberry? That's like a It's like a fucking This is where I stand on this, you know? They're not a discount brand, okay? They're a luxury brand. You know what I'm saying?
[23:00] Okay. So, long story short, I take Black Friday to reaffirm to people that you're not getting a fucking discount on my offers. Okay? I will literally post something on Black Friday that's like, "No, we don't have anything for you." You know, uh we don't discount. So again, could be an opportunity to do the same. Really up to you.
[23:25] Um, okay. You guys picking up what I'm putting down? Put a yes in the chat. Put a one in the chat if you are. Feel free to unmute yourself and ask any questions if you got anything before we continue on on how to maximize the rest of the year.
[23:42] Okay, cool. Any questions? Sweet.

NÚMEROS: December 1-7 (Week 1), 8-14 (Week 2), 15-20 (Week 3), 21-28 (Dead Zone), Christmas Eve Dec 24 (Tuesday), Christmas Dec 25 (Wednesday), New Year's Eve Dec 31 (Tuesday), New Year's Jan 1 (Wednesday)
VISUAL: Calendário completo de dezembro com zonas marcadas, primeira metade em verde (alta atividade), segunda metade em vermelho (baixa atividade), datas de feriados destacadas
[23:52] All right. So after Black Friday and Cyber Monday this following week, we're officially in December from that point, there's a few things to consider. Okay, number one, if like me, as an example for a part of the uh the niches that we service uh where we help raise capital, there's a lot of Jewish holidays coming up at the beginning of December where they don't use technology and you know, they'll just be untapped completely.
[24:25] um second half of the month though during Christmas and that time frame uh they're technically some of the most active people who aren't actively participating. So again, if you sell to any kind of Jewish demographics, just keep in mind first half of the month's going to be poor. Second half of the month's going to be great.
[24:45] Vice versa, for most of the general population, the first half of December is what you're going to want to maximize. The second half of December is going to suck. Okay?
[25:00] It's like instead of just the week of Thanksgiving where you have essentially Wednesday to the weekend that we're talking about sucking, the second half of December usually starts to suck. Let me see to be clear on specific dates this year.
[25:18] Okay, so Christmas Eve falls on a Tuesday, Christmas falls on a Wednesday. Do you think people are going to actively work on the 23rd, which is a Monday? Now, it's going to be the same kind of thing.
[25:35] Now to be clear from that same perspective the 21st and the 22nd is a Saturday Sunday. So people are probably going to take a long nice probably week off. We could call it from the 21st through the 28th. Okay.
[25:52] So again for the first three weeks of December you got the 1st through the 7th week one got the 8th through the 14th week two. And then you got the 15th through the 20th week three. People are probably going to start fucking off around the 21st. through about the 28th. Okay.
[26:15] In most instances, you'll still have people working and kind of catching up a little bit on the 30th and maybe on the 27th, but again, on Tuesday, you have the 31st, New Year's Eve, and on Wednesday, you have January 1st. Okay?

NÚMEROS: 100% tax deduction, fiscal year 2024
VISUAL: Ícone de IRS, símbolo de 100%, calendário mostrando deadline de fim de ano, gráfico de urgência crescente
[26:38] So, it depends on what kind of offers you have. This dictates a lot about whether you're probable to actually make good money or not during this time frame. Let me give you a few examples. Okay, education products, the info product space, um any kind of business to business service or product that you offer, 100% tax deduction, 100% write-off.
[27:05] There's a big rush at the tail end of the year in order to make these investments in order to get the write-offs. Okay, that way accounts for the fiscal year of 2024 in this case.
[27:20] So, surprisingly, a lot of the info product brands and education companies and any kind of like B2B product or service that we sell surprisingly don't do that bad in the month of December. But there's a caveat to that. You have to push very aggressively for those first three weeks. Okay?
[27:42] the second half is still probable to suck because those same people are still typically in most instances doing very well and want to have the time with their family and take off and you know this is a great time of year where most people justify their family time.
[28:00] So you can't expect that the 21st through the 31st is going to be the best but again there's a there's usually still a tremendous amount of revenue that's generated in those first three weeks from people needing the write-offs.
[28:18] Same thing technically right after Christmas is done. Um I don't know about you guys, but again, if you still didn't make those purchases yet through the 26th through like the 30th, there's still a little sweet spot there to kind of push people via email marketing, like text reminders, have your sales people reach out to press people on getting that transaction done before the end of the year again in order to get the write off.

[28:50] So, make sure that you're aware whether what you sell is 100% tax deduction or not, which is very probable to be just given almost all of you on this call sell something B2B or again some kind of like info education product or agency service. Um, you have a lot of uh lot lot of upside there using that specific hook.
[29:15] Um, you want to become familiar with the tax code given where you operate and who you're selling to that you can literally send to people. So, like you can go to IRS.gov, You can look up the specific tax code. You can ask you can ask chatgbt by the way or any other AI service LLM that you're subscribed to at this point what that specific tax code is.
[29:40] That way you can go to IRS.gov literally grab the article and use it in your followup. That works tremendously well as a as a final reminder and a push in order to incentivize the transactions.
[29:55] We are not usually doing any kind of discounts or participating in any kind of uh like Black Friday like promotions throughout the month of December. U we just generally stack the first half of the month.

[30:12] So I'll give you a great example. Let's use the Cody Sanchez account that we have. U we have usually a monthly webinar that's done somewhere between like the 11th through the 13th, one of those days. U this particular month of December coming up. We're going to be doing that on the 10th. That way there's enough time through the rest of that week and the week that follows for all of those calls to get closed up. Okay.
[30:42] Usually it takes about two-ish weeks from the time that we do those webinars for all of the calls to actually get completed. And in some instances, they even push into the third week of the month. Well, again, we're just trying to maximize that specific window.
[31:00] We also have a new $35,000 product and that will also be selling through a webinar that we're going to be doing on December 4th because it's a higher ticket product. Regularly, she sells for 10K. We have a 35K product now that we're going to be selling. that 35k product that we're going to be pushing now.
[31:25] We expect a slightly longer sales timeline. So, we want to do that in that literal first week, right after Cyber Monday. We're going to be doing that on Wednesday the 4th. And that'll give people the literal full 3 weeks right before Christmas in order to pull the trigger on that decision.
[31:45] And again, slightly higher ticket product. We're going to be using the IRS hook uh aggressively on that one, especially as we get closer to the Christmas time frame. U can't stress enough how effective the write-off hook is during this specific push in order to maximize revenue.

VISUAL: Gráfico de distribuição de calls assimétrico, peso maior nas primeiras 3 semanas, matemática de closer availability, comparação spend distribution
[32:08] If you have any events like that where you're doing some type of webinar or you really want to frontload your calendars, you also want to tell your closers, look, here's what's going to happen. We either finish the year strong or we kind of get fucked in the second half of the month. It's not a normal month. We need to frontload. Okay?
[32:30] That means we need to have our closers more available for longer durations of time in terms of their total call slots they're going to take per day essentially from the first through the 20th. Okay, we need them to have more time during that window and then they themselves can have less time on the calendars during the second half of the month.
[32:50] Does that make sense?
[32:52] PARTICIPANTE: Yeah.
[32:54] Cool. Okay. Questions on this? Does everybody understand what I'm saying when I say frontload the calendars? We want to book into the first half of the month more aggressively than the second half. And this is just math.
[33:10] Let's use the example. Throughout the month, I get 300 calls. And let's say that my closers regularly take those 300 calls throughout the week. Okay? I want those closers to ideally take upwards of 200 of those calls in the first half of the month, maybe even upwards of 225.
[33:35] And I want the other 75 to be spread out throughout that last week and a half. I do not want them being evenly spread out throughout the month. I want upwards of like 200 to 225 within that first three weeks. Okay.
[33:52] Also want to factor in sales cycles. If you do want to do some kind of incentive before the end of the year just to close your fiscal year out strong, um I want to be fair in saying the best time to follow up with that is generally sometime after Christmas.

VISUAL: Calendário destacando janela de oportunidade pós-natal, dias 26-30 em verde (alta conversão), 31 em amarelo (baixa atividade)
[34:12] It's like the literal day after on the 26th is a Thursday. If you start pushing that type of messaging like, "Hey, pull the trigger by the end of the year." 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, and 30th are your best days. New Year's Eve probably not going to get a lot of action either.
[34:35] Uh Adrian says, "Does that mean marketing gets off more spend in the first two weeks?" Yes, that's exactly what that means, Adrian. You're you're frontloading the spend.
[34:48] So, let's use the same example to get that 300 set of calls that um you're going to be looking at uh let's call it, you know, $200,000 in spend or something like that. Um if that $200,000 in spend would usually over four weeks equate to uh you know 50,000 a week.
[35:15] U we're going to we're going to divvy that up to be upwards of like 150,000 in the first three ideally like first two and a half weeks since it takes a couple days usually to actually get the calls to come through. 72-hour delay. And then we're going to spend that other remaining like 50 to 75,000 throughout that remaining week and a half.
[35:40] Same kind of logic as Thanksgiving. We're going to be very aware that like we're going to get low show rates on Christmas Eve, on Christmas, potentially even on the day before Christmas Eve, the 23rd with people traveling or potentially traveling over the weekend.
[36:00] Same kind of logic with the messaging that we talked about where we're going to be communicating with people in that like kind of fun way where it's like, "Hey, uh, saw you booked on the 23rd. like you don't have any flights that day, right? You know, um want to make sure that you're on the same page and didn't accidentally book those. That's kind of messaging you want to use.
[36:25] Evan said, uh so with Cody's example, you guys are using two webinars to basically fuel and aggressively frontload calls for the sales team during those first three weeks. Yes, Evan, in addition to that, we have a VSSL that runs.
[36:42] We'll we'll do exactly what I just described where we frontload VSSL spend as well. Um and again, we have all the closer availability really pushed at the front end of the month. um they're they're regularly available during the second half of the month, but again, we we we know that they're going to take off and we also know that the leads are going to take off.
[37:05] So, just make sure that you try to make as much as you can in those first twoish twoish three weeks. All right, questions on that?
[37:18] Cool. Anything anybody have any comments? Anything you guys want to add? Anything that uh that you're doing that you think will help? Yeah. Okay, cool.
[37:30] Anybody Anybody uh excited or afraid? What do you guys think? [laughter] Put it in the chat. Are you looking forward to it or no?

[37:50] PARTICIPANTE: Uh last year we moved everyone from Kajjabi and Facebook group to school to have it all in one place and we used um Black Friday because it was that weekend uh to really get people over because like just adoption is the hardest part of changing platforms but also added a lot of like low ticket people.
[38:15] We took the first module from our high ticket, made a low ticket, and that was what you get as a mini course just for joining the community on a monthly subscription. That actually turned into a lot of upsells over the the course of the next month. So, we still had a great December.
[38:35] Would you say this is a good time to actually because I've never advertised the low ticket, just a membership. Would you say it's a good time to push that through ads to get more people in the community and potential for more upsells into like more sales calls into December?
[38:52] Yeah, 100%. That's a that's a great that's a great uh great point to make for sure. Yes, totally agree.

[39:18] PARTICIPANTE: Yeah, just um I guess one thing is you know one thing that we typically don't describe uh subscribe to is like the whole Black Friday discount thing either. And uh one thing I found that's helpful with that is like putting it back on the prospect in a sense of like you know did you when when you booked this call initially were you booking it because you thought there was going to be a discount or because you got on and it happens to be Black Friday now you're just like looking for a discount
[39:50] and just reminding them like it's about the transformation and not the actual like uh like it's not about the discount it's about the transformation that they're here for. So, that's just uh some framing I've used in the past like for holidays or when people expect some sort of discount. That's helpful. And like making sure to like relay that to your sales team, too.
[40:15] Yeah, makes sense. Here, role play with me real quick. No, act like you showed up to a sales call and ask for a discount or like imply that you were thinking there was going to be a discount.
[40:28] PARTICIPANTE: Sure. Um, yeah. So, I mean, it sounds good. Um, you know, so I I assume you guys like have some sort of like discount on that. It's like, you know, it's Black Friday. Do you guys are you guys running any sort of like promotions or specials for that?

[40:50] No. I got a question for you. With uh with what we sell, you're expected to make money with it, right?
[40:58] PARTICIPANTE: Yeah, presumably. Yeah.
[41:00] So, I charge you 4K a month. What do you think that you're probable to make off that investment based on where we're at right now?
[41:10] PARTICIPANTE: I mean, once we get ads turned around, everything probably like, you know, an extra like at least 10 20k a month.
[41:18] So 10K a month, that's 120K a year. 20K a month, that's 240 a year. I mean, how much harder do you want to fuck me?
[41:28] PARTICIPANTE: Yeah. [laughter]
[41:32] I love that. You're already fucking me hook. Okay. I put it in perspective all the time like that. Like when we sell a $5,000 info product, uh again, like what we cover inside of that master internet marketing program, it's obviously all intended to help make people money.
[41:52] And we already tell people, we're like, "Dude, I can charge you so much more for this with what you're probable to make off of it." Okay? The spectrum is already so imbalanced in your favor for how hard you're fucking me. Okay?
[42:10] I'm trying to price it in a fair way to make the decision easy, but I want to be clear. you are hosing me here on what we're providing for you in comparison to what you get on the other side of that cost. Okay?
[42:28] And I I honestly view it almost as like borderline disrespectful that you want to fuck me even harder, you know? Just doesn't feel good. Um, how many other people out there have something that is as clear of a value proposition with a fucking wrap sheet of people that come in, see immediate success with it, and go out and make money, and you show up wanting a discount.
[42:55] I got to be honest, no, I don't think we want to sell it to you anymore. I um I think we're going to take a day to think about it, and we'll circle back with you, and we'll let you know if uh we think it's a good fit or not. But we're I don't know. We're almost offended by you asking.

VISUAL: Postura de "want vs need", exemplo do "King" prospect, framework de leverage transparente, processo de capitulação do prospect
[43:20] [laughter] Leo and I do this thing we call it the stiff arm. And we mean it when we say it. Like the stiff arm is like, "I want your business, but I really don't give a shit about your business." Like, I really I really want your money. You know, I appreciate your money, but like, dude, I don't care at all.
[43:42] Like, think about the guy the other day that wanted us to sign an NDA that if we ever name dropped the guy for 30 years, he could hammer us with a $100,000 fine per namedrop for him to join into the inner circle. And he referred to himself as Leo, tell me if I'm wrong. How do you how do you describe himself with the word king in third person? Like did he say the king?
[44:10] LEO: Yeah. He lit he literally thought he was the king.
[44:15] Yeah. So when he would talk about himself, he wouldn't he wouldn't say it like with with like whatever it is like eyes and you know I am. He would he would say the king does this or like you know that's how you talk about himself in the third person.
[44:32] And anyway, long story short, it's like we don't give a absolute shit about that guy's money. Okay? Like we don't care about that at all. If it's the wrong deal, like it's the wrong deal. We don't care.
[44:48] So when people come in and they have like the wrong perception, um like look, we we do the stiff arm where we're just like no, you know, we we're not doing. So we told that guy, we're like no, you know, we're not we're not signing the NDA.
[45:05] He immediately folded and was like, okay, well, you know, it's okay if he doesn't sign the NDA. Just preferably he doesn't name drop us. And we're like, "Dude, if we make you a fuckload of money, like we're going to talk about it."
[45:22] And then he was like, "Okay, well, you know, if you're going to talk about it, I mean, just like be respectful when you're talking about it, you know, and just at least like give us credit for the work that we put in."
[45:35] You know, it's like the other person always capitulates when you hold firm on whatever you're talking about. So, if you're going to do the no discount thing, I can't stress how effective the you're already fucking me hook is if you're actually good at what you do and make people money on the other side of the investment.
[45:55] Does that make sense?
[45:58] PARTICIPANTE: Yeah. Yeah, you could say it however you want, you know, with my with my brand like, you know, I just I just am who I am. So, I don't I don't try to like mask it in any particular way and like use fancier words, but you could say it however you'd like, you know.
[46:15] [laughter] But quick question on the stiff arm. When you guys use that, do you typically find the prospect like pretty immediately turns themselves around on that call or do you typically like find them where they're like, "Oh, okay." Uh, and then you circle back with them and you're like, you know, if you're willing to do XYZ, then we're willing to accept you.

[46:40] Great question. It's It's not always immediate, but without exaggeration, I'm not in any way, shape, or for exaggerating. 100% of the time, the stiff arm works. Okay? Literally 100% of the time. It might take a week, might take a month, could be immediate. Most of the time, it's immediate, but yeah, it's this.
[47:05] It's this genuine mindset. You really got to be convicted on the mindset to make it work, which is like an authentic like I want to do it, but again, I really really don't give a shit if we actually do it or not. You know, it's not going to it's not going to make or break me if we do this.
[47:28] It's probably going to make or break you if you do it, but it's not going to make or break me if we do this. Okay? Uh again, like we want it, but we don't need it. And usually what we're articulating back is like a fair, reasonable thing.
[47:45] Like take the NDA guy again. It's like that's a very fair and reasonable thing. I don't need to sign that. It's also a very fair and reasonable thing that I could name drop you in the instance that we turn you from a fucking guy like that into somebody who's actually making money and like at scale doing well, you know?
[48:08] It's like we're going to do that for sure. And if they don't want to do that, like we don't care. We just won't do the deal. And again, just like that guy, it's like within minutes, you know, it's just like, okay, well, yeah, I guess we're the ones being unreasonable here. or if they if they actually want to do the deal, then they have to peel back in order to get the deal done.

[48:38] There was this good one too where uh it's like our pricing as an example where we do the 15k and the 10% and we like we literally price it in a way where we already think the 15k is like not enough, but we still like the 15k. Like the 15K still makes enough of an impact on us financially where we as a company appreciate the money, but at the same time it's like you're already to be prioritized on our client roster.
[49:10] You're competing with people who are already paying us like tens of thousands or even low hundreds of thousands. And we have to charge you enough to like make it worth adding you into the roster. If you in any way, shape, or form like don't meet what we want in terms of pricing, we just won't do the deal because it doesn't make sense.
[49:32] That's a very fair, transparent argument that we make if and when anybody has a counter to our pricing and wants to do it for less. Or sometimes people try to offer us like larger percentages of gross to in order to reduce the upfront fee.
[49:50] And even then, like we have examples of times where we've done that and we just transparently talk about our behavior, you know, and the fact that we didn't prioritize those deals or those relationships because it didn't meet our standard how everybody else is paying.
[50:10] You know, like we might have a call literally later that day with somebody who's going to pay what we just asked them to pay. And again, you have to have like true transparent leverage when you deploy the stiff arm.
[50:25] It's not like some egotistical like, oh, we're going to do the deal my way. We're not going to do it at all. Like, no, you have to be like very transparent about like why that's reasonable for you to take the position you're taking. Does that make sense?
[50:42] PARTICIPANTE: 100%.
[50:45] Yeah. It works every fucking time when you do have reasonable transparent leverage, you know? [laughter]

[51:10] Yeah, Mason, I would definitely encourage you use that same hook to be clear. Like the you're already fucking me hook again. It's it's just a way to articulate transparent leverage. It's like, so Mason, as an example, what do you charge? What what what are your pricing currently?
[51:28] MASON: 5K.
[51:30] You you're teaching them a skill to go out and charge businesses how much on average per deal they close.
[51:38] MASON: Like 3 to 5K per month.
[51:42] So they're literal retards only close one deal, they make their money back in two months.
[51:48] MASON: Exactly.
[51:50] You're fucking me already. Like how do you not see that? You're fucking me. The only reason you'd want to pay less is because you're struggling to come up with the 5K. And if you have payment plans, you could be like, "This is where you introduce your payment plan to, you know, this is where you can introduce them to funding."
[52:12] The you're fucking me hook is literally perfect for you in that case. [laughter]
[52:20] MASON: Tell my guys,
[52:22] they'd probably be quite receptive to it, too, given they're also younger. Um, to be fair, I've never really had anybody offended by that. I'm not trying to imply you're going to offend people with it, but you know, given the niche you participate in, some people don't like bad words, so be mindful of that. But with college students, you should be fine.

[54:00] That way, if and when your salespeople call them to upsell them to the high ticket, there are evidence differences for for again transparent, reasonable wise for why somebody would actually upsell into the higher ticket offer.
[54:18] If they're too similar, what you're going to hear when that upsell call occurs is, "Well, I kind of want to wait and see if I can get results with what I've already bought first." Does that make sense?
[54:32] PARTICIPANTE: Yeah. which we found [clears throat] when we were selling like that shit nothing $27 thing. We still have people that were like, "Oh, let me try this first before I go to coaching."

I just want to make it extremely clear what you just got into. So, we have this offer and then we have our higher ticket offer.
[55:25] Um, it's kind of like I've sold you a TV here and I've given you a manual on how to use it and how to program your remote and you've got to do it on your own. Our high ticket thing would be comparable to us coming into your home, putting it onto your wall with a mount, sitting down next to you and programming the remote with you and teaching you how to do it.
[55:50] you're just simply put, you're typically going to deal with less frustration, get faster results, um, you know, get what you're essentially here to do faster in the instance that you ever choose to upsell into our XYZ product that we have.
[56:10] Just keep in mind, again, you're really probable to get the results you're after buying what you just bought, but you got to do it on your own and we're not here to support you as much in this offer. uh you know, you have the community, you can tag us and ask questions, and like that's typically where you transition into the onboarding.
[56:32] And making that difference extremely clear in a framing video that they see right after the purchase is a great way to also deal with mitigating that specific excuse come time the upsell call occurs. Does that make sense?

[56:52] Okay. Uh homeowner Nick in the chat says, "I like to raise my price on Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and tell people it's the last day to get it at the original price." squeeze people on the fence.

[57:35] Yeah, that's a great idea for sure. You can also do it to cold traffic to be fair. I mean, you'd be amazed of uh just there's a lot of people out there who just like seek Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers on this particular weekend.
[57:52] So, it's it's just like a behavior that exists, you know? Have you ever seen the movie The Purge? Are you understand?
[58:00] It's like, as an example, this is a day of the of the year in that movie where people are just all of a sudden willing to commit crimes, but like the other days of the year, they're not willing to commit crimes.
[58:15] Yeah, the point I'm trying to make is like there's particular days of the year where people just like participate in the collective behavior that's happening and cold traffic can be very effective uh on those specific days.
[58:32] It's believe it or not technically when you have your highest probability to convert people who have no idea who you are on a sales page for a low ticket offer uh in the easiest ways and the most profitable way. So okay, big fan of cold traffic too on those. Dave,
[58:52] DAVE: could I just basically peel out my course and just do that for like47? Like no support, none of that. just make it extremely clear like I just said that um there is like something else they could buy on top of that but they're choosing to go this path instead.
[59:10] Got it.
[59:12] Okay. Any other questions on this?
[59:18] JEREMY: Yeah, Jeremy uh know this idea of dropping your prices for Black Friday and then some of your loyal clients who let's say they were wanting to buy a website for a long period of time then you drop it for Black Friday then they miss the offer and they'll come back and ask you a month later for that offer. Um, what do you think about that and how do you
[59:42] Yeah, we we covered that on the first half of the call. You were here.
[59:48] JEREMY: Apologies. Apologies. Apologies.
[59:52] All good, bro. The uh moral of the story is, yeah, you're going to cannibalize your sales pipeline if they do not take action on the offer when you make the offer. So, you have to make it extremely clear that this is the only time you're going to honor this offer.
[1:00:12] And even then, because you offered it at a lower price, they're not probable to take action on it at a later time. You essentially are clearing out the pipeline when you do that. So be very mindful of that if you choose to make that kind of offer.
[1:00:28] JEREMY: Got it. Cheers.
[1:00:30] No problem. All right. Cool. Um, anybody else take one more question here.
[1:00:38] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Low Ticket Funnel Structure"
NÚMEROS: Book a student success call post-purchase
VISUAL: Funil com VSSL ou copy destacando diferenças, free coaching call frame, upsell para high ticket, énfase em velocidade de resultado
[1:00:40] On my low ticket funnel, I have a book a student success page after they purchase. This call is framed as a free coaching call. Closer sells them on the higher ticket program. Would you continue doing this or completely switch it and have a VSSL with an application on the page with a very clear that's
[1:01:02] I I think the way you're doing it is fine. There's there's no problems with that. Again, just make sure in the VSSL on that page or whatever you have on that page, even if it's just copy, you just again make make the differences extremely clear.
[1:01:20] That's the main thing you got to do. It's just it's just usually a framing issue when somebody says, "Oh, I just bought this lower ticket thing. Like, let me try to get results with it first." It's it's not that there has to be a huge difference in the content talked about. It's just the speed in which they acquire the result. That's what has to be stressed when you go from a low ticket to a high ticket upsell.
[1:01:48] And there's a lot of similarities and crossovers in the in the u the topic at hand. Cool. All right, last call. Anybody else?
[1:02:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Low Ticket Ascension Requirements"
NÚMEROS: Não especificado numericamente
VISUAL: Processo de ascension tight, appointment setters/SDRs chamando ASAP, book a call sequence otimizada, prevenção de canibalização de high ticket sales
[1:02:02] PARTICIPANTE: U just I guess one little piece of value to add too for anyone doing the low ticket because we used to run these uh for a while. Um, make sure that your ascension is super super tight with like appointment setters, SDRs, like calling leads ASAP.
[1:02:22] Make sure that the like ascension right after like the book a call sequence and everything is super tight. Uh, because if not, you're just cannibalizing like a bunch of potential high ticket sales. If if it's just like low ticket sell, then they're gone.
[1:02:40] Cool. All right, sweet. Thanks for joining in everybody. Have a great Black Friday and uh we'll talk this upcoming Saturday. Obviously, we'll talk in the group chat in the meantime. You guys got questions about anything else, shoot me a DM.
[1:03:00] And uh yeah, happy Black Friday weekend, everybody. Make a fuckload of money or stiff arm a bunch of people and establish your dominance as a luxury brand. [laughter] All right, talk soon.
