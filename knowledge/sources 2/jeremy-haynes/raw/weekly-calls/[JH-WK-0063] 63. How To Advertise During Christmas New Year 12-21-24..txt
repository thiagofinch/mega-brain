Transcrição Completa: 63 How To Advertise During Christmas New Year 12 21 24
[00:00] Sweet. Welcome into this week's weekly group call. We're talking about what to do to milk the rest of 2024. Today, in addition to that, we're going to be talking about what to do to start off January, and I mean like literally the first days of January from an advertising perspective with some momentum.
[00:20] There's a lot of catastrophic things that happen to KPIs during this specific time frame of the year when you're operating any kind of high ticket business, especially when you're selling to the general public. If you are selling to rich people or if you're selling to the general public, the strategies that I talk here about today will ideally be applicable to you and help you make more money as a result of going through a few of them.
[00:48] I'm going to try to make this video in a way where, you know, for all the following years, you'll be able to leverage this, too, just in case you're watching this at, I don't know, like the end of 2025 or some shit like that.
[01:02] But, yeah, without further ado, let me start it off with the ultimate sauce for this whole finish to the year. And it's called the for the dogs sequence and messaging.

[01:18] Okay, as silly as this might sound, it's actually dead serious. For the dogs sequence and messaging. So, just like you guys right now sitting here talking to me about making more money the weekend before Christmas, what is everybody else right now in the United States doing besides serious people?
[01:36] Somebody unmute themselves and answer the question. What is everybody else in the general populace doing right now the weekend before Christmas?
[01:44] [PARTICIPANTE]: They're fucking off.
[01:46] 100%. They're fucking off hard. They're sitting around drinking liquored up eggnog, chilling with family members they don't genuinely give a fuck about, and praying that they get something they couldn't afford themselves for Christmas by somebody who loves them.
[02:02] You know what I mean? And what are you doing right now? The weekend before Christmas. You are a great example of one of the dogs. Okay?
[02:12] The people who give a fuck about money, about finishing the year strong, about going into 2025 strong, and about getting richer. Okay?
[02:22] And although yes, you likely also do care about and may, if you have a family, as an example, or a loved one that cares about Christmas and whatever holiday you may celebrate, you may obviously spend Christmas Eve, Christmas, hosting people, you know, having your kids open up gifts, whatever you got going on.
[02:40] There's obviously nothing wrong with that. Not sitting here trying to demonize Christmas and Santa Claus by any means. But again, what I am trying to emphasize is while you're doing that, I know what's going on in the back of your head.
[02:54] You're sitting there thinking, I can't believe on a Tuesday and Wednesday, I'm not making a fuckload more money as a result of Santa Claus forcing me to sit here and participate in this societal thing.
[03:06] Now again, whether you genuinely enjoy it or not, in the back of your mind, that dog is sitting there begging to run up that payment processor you got and finish the year at a greater number than what you otherwise will by sacrificing a Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon instead in the middle of a work week.
[03:24] You know what else everybody else out there thinks too who's also a dog? That same exact thing.
[03:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "The Dog Spectrum - Who Has Higher Probability?"
NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Espectro visual mostrando diferentes tipos de pessoas e sua probabilidade de serem "dogs" (pessoas focadas em dinheiro durante festas)
[03:32] Who has a higher probability? I want to call it the dog spectrum. Who has a higher probability out of the dog spectrum to be at peak dog mentality? I'll tell you.
[03:44] Number one, single people. Single people have a really high probability. Like some of you sitting here when I'm like, "Oh yeah, like you give a fuck about Christmas and you're going to open gifts with your family." The single dudes on here are like, "I'm not doing any of that."
[04:00] You know? Like I'm going to do what Jeremy just talked about where he's doing a webinar SOP on Christmas. You know what I mean? It's like you're not sitting around opening gifts. You're going to make money. You're going to do something to get ahead. You might even pitch people. Who knows?
[04:16] But my point being, look, if you're single, you have a lot higher probability to be more of a dog in comparison to being in a relationship.
[04:24] Second one, you can be in a relationship, but you got no kids. I also want to couple this, but I've run out of writing space with the fact that you don't have a partner that forces you to participate in things that you genuinely don't give a fuck to participate with.
[04:40] A great example of this, I've bought my girl this year eight bags. Eight as in the number that comes after seven, and she's already opened all that shit throughout November and December and all that fun stuff.
[04:54] I love loading her up this time of year. It's great to reward her for the dedication and all the help that she provides me being my partner. But you know what I love most? She is not going to shut the fuck up about anything that has to do with Christmas on Christmas Day.
[05:10] I'm going to sit there and type that webinar SOP and I'm not going to hear a single moan or cry about the fact that I'm doing something that makes money on that day.
[05:20] And that, ladies and gentlemen, whatever you want to call that, that type of person is also more probable to be a dog.
[05:28] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "The Fucking Off Phase - Opposite End of Spectrum"
NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Contraste visual entre "dogs" (pessoas focadas) e pessoas em fase de "fucking off" (relaxamento total)
[05:30] Now, the people who have no dog in them are the people obviously that are the exact opposite when it comes to the other side of the spectrum here. These people in particular are going to have a much higher probability to be in the fucking off phase.
[05:44] Okay, the fucking off phase is pretty simple to understand. I'm sure I don't need to articulate the exact opposite of what I've just described, but to lightly touch on it, these people will be fully participating most likely between now all the way through the new year with doing absolutely nothing.
[06:02] To be very fair, okay, some of these people, this is the only time of year where they genuinely get off and can fuck off. And respectfully to that person, if they've positioned themselves well enough financially to truly enjoy it and have no anxiety, to have completely silenced their inner dog by burying it with enough money to get it to shut up, then again, congratulations. That's a great position to be in.
[06:28] And even if it's the other version of fucking off where look, you're just not going to do anything. And again, you're going to treat it as like a little vacation time. Not trying to demonize it, just saying that's the other end of the spectrum where the messaging that I'm about to describe will not resonate with that person at all.
[06:46] Who is most probable to give you money during this time of the year? Somebody unmute yourself and state the obvious. Who out of these two people is best for you to gear your messaging towards at this time of year to continue to make money during this time of year?
[07:02] [PARTICIPANTE]: The dogs.
[07:04] Yeah, the fucking dogs. That's right. The fucking dogs. Okay.
[07:08] So, what are we going to do this time of year to maximize the revenue? We're going to talk to the fucking dogs. Okay.
[07:16] So, hear me out. This is how it goes. Whatever ads you're running right now, okay, from the 20th on. Remember how this entire month, even in November, I kept saying, I said, "Look, December is a first through the 20th month."
[07:32] Okay? The month dies after the 20th. Okay? That was not symbolic. That was literal. You guys have all experienced it now. I hope you haven't, but there's a very high probability, a dramatically high probability that you've all experienced this.
[07:48] Your show rate stats are starting to skyrocket. Okay? Your close rates are starting to drop. The excuses are starting to fly. Oh, I'll do this in the new year, you know? Not a dog, okay? Not a fucking dog.
[08:04] You need to scrub the pipeline of those types of people. And again, if you want to continue operating from the 20th through essentially the 2nd or 3rd of January, you have to gear your messaging towards the dogs. Okay?

[08:20] Now, how do you do that? The messaging in all forms, okay, is for the dogs. That includes email, that includes our ads, that includes our organic presence, our social media, our stories, our reels, our shorts, TikToks, wherever the fuck you're posting and getting attention at. Okay?
[08:40] Even our sales calls. Okay? We want our sales people to also be trained. Dude, you know what I'm telling Leo after this call? I'm saying, Leo, any person who gets on the phone with you between now and new year, you congratulate them and say, "Thank you. I want to congratulate you on being a serious person who gives a fuck about your money and getting richer. We're going to reward you for doing that."

NÚMEROS: $$ (símbolo duplo indicando alta efetividade)
VISUAL: Destaque visual com duplo cifrão, indicando estratégia altamente lucrativa testada anualmente
[09:08] Okay, here's the thing. We have a what we call for the dog incentive. Okay, this is how you can adapt your messaging and give yourself a really easy way to get some money during this time of year.
[09:20] Okay, matter of fact, it's not going to be a single dollar sign. It's going to be a double dollar sign because this works extremely well every year I've tested it. Okay.
[09:30] Let me stop sharing my screen here so I can get serious with you guys. So, the for the dog messaging. Okay, here's how simple it is.
[09:38] First of all, let me articulate what the message - I tried to give you a background not to like, you know, be funny or anything, but really to try to give you perspective on who specifically we're trying to communicate with so you can think with what these people give a fuck about.
[09:54] Okay? Try to give you some characteristics of these individuals like being single, no kids, having somebody who's not going to bitch in their ear about not doing something like participating in Christmas or whatever because that partner cares about the money too.
[10:10] My point being, we want to write emails, create ads, create posts, and have some type of for the dog incentive to communicate to these people specifically for the remainder of the year.
[10:24] From the 21st of December through about the 3rd of January, this is what you're going to do, okay?
[10:32] You're going to specifically call out this demographic. You're going to describe somebody. Somebody unmute yourself, tell me what your offer is. I'll give you a live example right now with some random shit that one of you sell. Somebody tell me what it is.
[10:46] [DANIEL]: Ours is add 50 to 100K in recurring revenue for med spas and telemedicine clinics.
[10:54] Okay. What else? Give me more. Not you. Not you. Other people. Give me other stuff now.
[11:00] [SANJAY]: Amazon.
[11:02] What was that? Amazon private label. Are they buying a course? Are they buying a done for you thing?
[11:08] [SANJAY]: It's like a hybrid. So, it's like we give them suppliers, products, photography, all that, and a course.
[11:16] Nice. Good. Geoff, what's yours?
[11:18] [GEOFF]: Ours is Chiro Marketing. We guarantee just booked appointments every 30 days.
[11:24] Got it. Okay. Daniel, your outcome is to get the med spas more customers and clients, I assume.
[11:30] [DANIEL]: Yeah.
[11:32] Is there any kind of buildout associated with it where they have to do stuff before they actually get to advertise? Like do they have to film ads, film VSLs or like get anything built out?
[11:42] [DANIEL]: Yeah, they do have to build some stuff out. Yeah.
[11:46] Okay, good. Geoff, is it the same thing for yours? Like people have to do a buildout during this time frame or no?
[11:52] [GEOFF]: No, not a lot. I mean, they literally shoot us like 15 to 20 iPhone shots and we use those in their ads because they're miserable on camera and most of them don't want to shoot videos. So no, it's not a lot of work on their part.
[12:06] Got it. And then Sanjay, for yours, for the Amazon private label thing, are people again like do they have to do any work or is this more of just something that they can purchase and then start?
[12:16] [SANJAY]: No, they do have to do work.
[12:18] What do they got to do?
[12:20] [SANJAY]: I mean, they just have to like go buy the product, get it shipped to Amazon, do the listing. Like, it's like 50/50 done for you, 50% do it yourself.
[12:30] Okay, enough said. Let's go.
[12:32] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Daniel's Med Spa Example - For The Dogs Ad Copy"
NÚMEROS: 2024, 2025
VISUAL: Exemplo de copy estruturado para med spas, destacando momento ideal para buildout durante período de festas
[12:34] So, Daniel's Med Spa clients, okay, the for the dogs communication for this one. Really simple. He's communicating to med spa owners and he's going to have people that need to build stuff out.
[12:46] What is the best time of year to build stuff out when people don't talk to you and you have uninterrupted time to do massive amounts of work with literally zero interruption?
[12:58] Put a one in the chat if your best work comes from being in deep flow state where nobody talks to you, you don't have any scheduled calls that day. How much more shit are you getting done on that day comparatively to any other day where you have even just a single call on your schedule?
[13:14] You're flying through shit on those days. So again, Daniel's communication and emails, ads, etc. can be:
[13:22] "You're a med spa owner who wants to finish 2024 strong. You want to go into 2025 with some serious momentum. Okay? You're not one of these people that's going to be sitting around opening up gifts.
[13:36] You, your wife, your partner, whoever you're with, they and you care deeply about momentum, about money, about getting richer, about getting more patients into your practice.
[13:48] And you and I both know the reason your marketing kind of sucks right now and you don't get as many patients as you otherwise could is because you don't have the proper things built out.
[14:00] When is the best possible time to get everything built out? When people don't talk to you, you have nothing on your schedule for one of the rare blue moon opportunities in the entire year.
[14:12] You have an opportunity on Christmas and Christmas Eve where all you're going to get is merry Christmases. That's all you're going to get. No one's going to bug you otherwise.
[14:22] You and me can work together on getting your VSLs built out, your direct response ads built out, your marketing automation built out, and instead of it dragging on like it would during any other time of the year, you and I in a concentrated effort can knock this shit out in a day, maybe two days.
[14:40] And we can get that launched before the end of the year, go into the new year strong, getting leads into that business for you to close, getting new patients into the med spa.
[14:50] You and I, we're the same. We care right now about finishing the year strong. You and I aren't sitting around doing nothing during this remainder of the year. You and I, we're going to get this deal done together.
[15:04] You're going to fill out this form and we're going to talk about what you're going to do step by step to get that money up and get that patient count up before the end of the year.
[15:14] If you're interested, fill out the form below. Press the button. Again, this is not for the person who's gonna tell me, 'Oh, we're gonna start it in January.' Don't talk to me if that's you, okay? Don't fill out the form.
[15:28] This is not for you if that's your mindset right now. This is for the people who care about the fiscal year finishing strong, who want the momentum going into 2025.
[15:38] Not for the people who are going to tell me two weeks into January it's time to start. Me and the people who are filling out this form right now, we're going to be running circles around you in the meantime. If that's you, if that's you, fill out the form. Let's go."
[15:54] You know, that's like the ad video. You take that same general messaging, you apply it into email form. Okay, the for the dogs sequence.
[16:04] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "For The Dogs Incentive - Inner Circle Example"
NÚMEROS: $4,000/month (current), $5,000/month (new price), 15K (Gold Gordon investment mentioned)
VISUAL: Exemplo de precificação estratégica, mostrando incentivo para compradores imediatos vs aumento futuro
[16:06] Now, in addition to that, you can pepper into that hook as well the for the dogs incentive. So, the for the dogs incentive, let me be really clear on this.
[16:16] So, for us, let's use the inner circle as a great example. We're raising the price of this to 5k a month because you people still buy at $4,000 a month with no resistance.
[16:28] And the spectrum of the "you're fucking me" scale is still exponentially in your favor, which it still will be even at 5K a month.
[16:38] The amount you'll make, take Gabriel's scenario that we talked about before I started recording here. Okay? I just saved Gabriel, even though he spent 15k with Gold Gordon, if he actually takes my advice, I just saved him so much financial loss and I will make him so much more money with literally one thing he learned about.
[16:58] What is this, Gabriel? Like your second day in this course. How long you been in here? Two days or three days?
[17:04] [GABRIEL]: Yeah, like three days, man.
[17:06] You'll fuck me so hard on what you paid to be in this group. You'll probably throw me a bone at the end of next year from how much money I make you comparatively to how little money you're going to pay me.
[17:18] Okay? So, we give people the for the dogs incentive rather than just telling them, "Hey, we're going to raise the price to 5k. That's what you pay now." No. No.
[17:28] Everybody who buys between now and the end of the year, dude, we'll let you in and we'll give you that rate. Instead of charging you more, we're going to charge you less right now. We're going to charge you technically again the 4k a month.
[17:42] But remember, trying to create friction. You know, I want less people to buy because it's a finite resource. I can't have the same quantity of people that purchase regularly that they do. I got to find the sweet spot where there's enough friction where people actually start saying no on a serious note.
[17:58] But anyway, I digress. Point I'm trying to make is very simple. We're not going to raise the price tomorrow, which we should. We'll raise the price after the new year.
[18:08] We'll let all those turds who decided to wait until the new year to do something. We'll punish them financially as a result. You're a dog. You get the better price today because you, my friend, care about money and getting that momentum started before the finish of the year.
[18:26] You get what I'm saying? This is like what you want to be communicating in your own words. This is how I get to communicate it because this is how I communicate things.
[18:34] You can communicate it in your own brand's voice for your own version of the for the dogs incentive. I literally call it the for the dogs incentive. I literally write my emails and in my ads will openly say this is for the dogs.
[18:48] Okay? I will describe the dogs just as I've done on this call with you here today. You do it in your own version for whatever fits you. Okay? For whatever verbiage and vocabulary and all that fun stuff that you specifically want to use.
[19:02] I'm going to do it the way I'm articulating and feel free to copy it to the tee. I don't care at all about that.
[19:08] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Geoff's Chiropractic Example - Seasonal Leverage"
NÚMEROS: December 20th - January 2nd/3rd
VISUAL: Aplicação específica para quiropráticos, destacando contexto sazonal (viagens, postura, atividades físicas das festas)
[19:10] Okay. Let's continue on. So, Geoff's offer. Chiropractic. Geoff, it's literally damn near the same exact message. You're just swapping out instead of med spas and - I don't - do chiropractors call their people patients or do they call them customers or what? What do they call them? What's the word?
[19:26] [GEOFF]: It's all patients. Yeah.
[19:28] You're literally the same exact - like, you're just doing a copy and paste of exactly what I just said for the med spas except you're doing it for the chiropractors.
[19:36] Now, in your case, saying that there might not be as much that they need to build out, that's fine. You - I will say this, there is one thing specifically that you can pepper into yours, which is really good, which is:
[19:50] "Okay, you're a chiropractor. Right now is the perfect time of year to start advertising. And I've got a great incentive for those of you who want to finish the year in a fiscally strong manner. I've got a for the dogs incentive.
[20:04] Okay? For those of you who aren't going to give us excuses about, oh, start it in January. You don't care about this seasonality shit. You want to be maximizing the amount of patients that you're bringing into your practice right now.
[20:18] Let me tell you what these people are going through. They're taking flights. They're in cars. They're on long drives. They're sitting on couches all day in places that they regularly don't sit.
[20:30] You know what that means for you? They're playing football out in the yard. They're bending down, opening up gifts, lifting heavy shit for their kids. What does that mean for their backs? What's that mean for their SI joints? What's that mean for their alignment?
[20:44] You know, they're getting thrown out of proportion. You know what those people need and they're going to be actively thinking about? Chiropractor. They're going to be thinking about, I need somebody to get me back into alignment.
[20:56] And I want to reach those patients right now while all your competitors are asleep. None of them are advertising right now. None of them are thinking about advertising.
[21:06] They're the ones bending down picking up gifts right now while you sit there stewing on how you can get more people into your practice. I'm going to help you fill out the form. Let's get these people in line. Let's get more people into your practice.
[21:20] I've even got an incentive for those who are action takers right now. We're going to punish the people saying they want to wait until January. They'll pay more than what you pay today. Fill out the form and let's talk."
[21:32] And again, same thing for emails, same thing for the hooks. You use a lot of what I talked about in Daniel's example and you specifically leverage the circumstances that the people are going to be in.
[21:44] Because when a chiropractor hears that, I guarantee if I said this to my chiropractor, he'd be like, "Wow." You know, that's exactly what the fuck's going to happen right now.
[21:54] My chiropractor is Jewish. He's a perfect example of somebody that you'd reach right now with the for the dogs communication. He doesn't give a fuck about Christmas. He gives a fuck about money. You know what I mean?
[22:06] He comes over every Tuesday. It's Christmas Eve. You think he's delaying me on Christmas Eve? No. He's enthused to come over on Christmas Eve and get that money. You know what I mean?
[22:18] So anyway, ad videos if you run ads, email marketing to the list, you know, all these things. This is what you specifically communicate. Does that make sense?
[22:26] [GEOFF]: Yes, sir.
[22:28] Okay, good. You have questions on that?
[22:30] [GEOFF]: No, that makes a lot of sense.
[22:32] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Sanjay's Amazon Example - Negotiating Leverage"
NÚMEROS: Q4, Q1
VISUAL: Estratégia de leverage sazonal para Amazon, destacando melhor momento para negociação com fornecedores
[22:34] Okay, good. And then Sanjay, yours is a lot more simple to be fair. So yours you get to leverage the fact that - remember you always want to talk about leverage in any type of communication.
[22:46] So, the leverage inside of the Amazon space, when do you think is the absolute worst time to have negotiating leverage for buying new product?
[22:56] [SANJAY]: During Q4.
[22:58] And when do you think is the literal best possible time to get leverage on buying inventory from any type of manufacturer or wholesaler?
[23:06] [SANJAY]: During Q1.
[23:08] Literally on Christmas and right after Christmas would be the greatest possible time. And to your point, yes, during the first part of Q1 because they in that specific window know and anticipate that their sales are going to plummet, drop like a rock.
[23:24] Because yeah, some people to be fair might go through their inventory during Q4 and then reorder during Q1. But again, what's the probability that new buyers come in?
[23:34] It's like new buyers all pop up during Q4, right before Q4 in order to maximize Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and through the holiday. Those people go back under a rock until the fourth quarter before and they don't order shit until then.
[23:48] You have an opportunity right now to milk with that specific hook along with just the same general for the dogs hook. Does that make sense?
[23:56] [SANJAY]: Yep.
[23:58] Okay, good. Again, let's go through this and let's practice a little bit so I can ensure that you guys understand this.
[24:04] Andrew, unmute yourself. Give me the for the dogs hook version of your specific offer for Silver Living Homes.
[24:12] [ANDREW]: I'm trying to think about that. If you are somebody who is impatient, doesn't want to wait till the first of the year, and you want to leverage some tax write-offs for buying real estate while making an impact in your community, we have an incentive for you to go right now.
[24:30] Listen, here's what it is instead. Okay? It's almost the end of 2024. It's one of the last opportunities to make a financial transaction that reduces your tax burden before you owe that money to Uncle Sam instead.
[24:46] On top of that, your houses that somebody else owns right now, they just squandered all their money on gifts, on trips, and they need cash.
[24:56] You know the greatest possible time to have leverage over another individual that owns an asset that you want? You know when that greatest leverage is? When they are cash poor, my friend, and they need money.
[25:10] They have credit card bills come due in January. You could start that negotiating with them literally right now to get your first or next sober living home so you can close 2024 strong with a nice tax deduction and go into 2025 with some cash flow, my friend.
[25:28] If you're interested, I've got a for the dogs discount. This isn't for those sitting around opening up gifts on Christmas Day. This is for those that are going to be cold calling people, lowballing them for their house on Christmas instead.
[25:42] If that's you, fill out this form. I've got a for the dogs offer for you and I'm excited to help you get into your first or next sober living home. See the difference there?
[25:52] [ANDREW]: Got it.
[25:54] Bang. Okay. Give me yours, bro. Unmute yourself. What do you got?
[26:00] [ASIL]: Okay. Yeah. So for context, we are YouTube ads for coaches, course creators, consultants. So for us, it would be - yeah, if you want to stop messing around on Facebook and you finally want to get an optimal selling system dialed in, you want to get dialed into cold...
[26:20] No, no, no, no. This is not it. You start with the leverage. What's the leverage for why somebody would want to maximize selling courses at the end of the year?
[26:30] It's like the leverage is that education is a 100% write off and deduction. Okay, perfect example.
[26:38] Any of you that want to give me an annual amount for the inner circle and get a tax write off instead of paying monthly, congrats. We'll give you two to three months off depending on what you pay to be a part of the inner circle on an annual basis.
[26:54] And instead of paying over the course of an entire fiscal year, the 12 months, we'll discount it down to nine or 10 months instead. Again, depending on what your monthly rate is.
[27:04] And why would you do that? Because it's a 100% tax deduction. It's a 100% write off. You want to put that money technically back in your own pocket instead of Uncle Sam's pocket to be a part of a group you're otherwise going to pay to be a part of an entire year anyway.
[27:20] Why not do it now and get the write-off instead? It's like again the course - the course write off is 100% write-off, dude.
[27:28] So, you'd want to start it off with: "Listen, you're a course creator, coach, consultant, somebody that's out here. You have an education company, okay? You're making people more money through your product or service. You're helping people get a specific result and outcome.
[27:44] What's the best time of year to buy one of these offers now? Why now? It's a 100% deduction. You right now, if you're targeting any kind of affluent buyer, a business owner, somebody who cares about lowering their tax burden, you need to get in front of people right now.
[28:02] They're not going to go out and splash 300K on a 6,000lb vehicle. You know what? They'll splash a couple grand on you. Right now, you're not getting in front of them because you don't have an ad strategy that milks this time of year.
[28:16] Instead, your ad costs are flying. You decided to shut down your ads during this time of year because you don't have a plan. You don't know what to do. I've got a plan. I know exactly what to do.
[28:28] We're going to get all those people who do care about lowering their tax burden in front of you on the phone and transacting with your company before the year ends.
[28:38] Fill out this form. We got a battle plan blueprint to maximize 2024 with a for the dogs incentive. We'll do calls on Christmas Eve, Christmas if you want us to. We want to help you make money. We want to help you finish 2024 strong and go into 2025 strong.
[28:54] Fill out the form if this is for you." You see what I'm saying? Like you don't start off the ad with "pay through," you know. You know what I mean? Like get some energy to it. What are the dogs like? What are the dogs like Asil?
[29:08] [ASIL]: Energy and like...
[29:10] Like money, you know? You ever watch the Wolf of Wall Street or any other movie that talks about money openly?
[29:16] [ASIL]: Yeah.
[29:18] Like think about that. You know, it's like again, be yourself. Say it in your own way. Do what you want to do. But you have to use the leverage. That's the big part that you're missing.
[29:28] Is notice how I start the ad for you. It's listen, when's the best time of year to buy a course? When's the best time of year to buy an education product? Now, why? It's 100% write off. It's 100% deduction.
[29:42] You want your customer to put that money in Uncle Sam's pocket instead of yours. Why would you want that? No. Let's run some ads to these people. Let's get them some cash. You get what I mean?
[29:54] [ASIL]: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Gotcha. Yeah. I didn't even think of that.
[29:58] Yeah. Again, because you're not thinking with leverage. All I'm thinking with to come up with that hook is what's the leverage.
[30:06] Like why did I come up with Andrew's hook versus what Andrew said? You know, it's like, okay, I'm just thinking somebody just splashed a fuckload of money on gifts. They got their credit card bills coming up and they're going to be cash strapped.
[30:20] And on top of that, I can also tie in the tax deduction of buying a property at the end of the year and the cash flow for 2025. It's like bam, leverage, talking about that straight away.
[30:32] So, it's like identify the leverage. That's what you open with and you just bundle it together with the for the dogs hook. Does that make sense to everybody?
[30:42] Put a one in the chat if that makes sense to everybody. Put a two in the chat or just unmute yourself if you got a question on that. I want to make sure this is really clear.
[30:52] Identify leverage and you communicate that immediately and you just bundle that together with the for the dogs hook. Does that make sense? Okay.

[31:04] Now, let me get away from the ad videos real quick. Let me talk emails. So, on an email basis, it's like we want to do a for the dogs email sequence, okay?
[31:14] Ideally, we have a series of email communication that goes out, okay, between now and the end of the year, and we adapt it relative to what day specifically it's being sent.
[31:26] So, we adapt it specifically around, okay, like now it's Christmas time. Okay, now Christmas is done. Now it's New Year's. You know, we're just subtly adapting the scarcity tactics we use if there's some type of tax write-off deduction associated with it.
[31:42] Or we adapt it to look, you don't give a fuck about sitting around opening gifts and stuff like that. Like if you do, you know, again, respectfully, like that's great. Nothing against you, you know, hope you have a merry Christmas.
[31:54] But like dog, if you're one of the dogs, you know what I mean? Like talk to me. You know, I got an offer for you that's going to make you money. That's that.
[32:04] Okay. Again, what I'm really just trying to emphasize here is these are the only people that are probable to buy from you during this time of the year. These are the only people that are highly probable to have consumption of this type of messaging.
[32:18] And that's why we want to tailor our messaging towards these individuals.

[32:24] If you remember this golden rule of copywriting, okay? When you adapt your messaging to be what the counterparty is thinking in their head already, you amplify the power of that message resonating.
[32:38] Okay? If I can say what you think, if I can say out loud what you think, we are on the same page. You resonate with what I'm saying. You're attracted to what I'm saying as a result of that. Do you get what I mean?
[32:52] Okay, that's the whole point of this type of communication. I promise you this. These people specifically feel isolated during this time of year. They don't feel like there's anybody out there for them.
[33:04] That's the biggest part I want you to understand about all this. They feel alone. And you, my friend, think, tell me one time, any one of you right now, unmute yourself and tell me a single time in the history of you opening your email, in the history of you seeing the ads that you've seen a for the dogs ad or you've read a for the dogs email.
[33:26] Tell me right now one time that somebody's thrown you a bone over the years. Prove me wrong.
[33:32] You'll be the first person throwing these individuals a lifeline in their life around this time of year, letting them know that they're not isolated, letting them know that there's other people like them and letting them know that you give a fuck about them making more money and helping them finish the year strong.
[33:48] See what I mean? Any one of you right now who pay to be a part of other groups, I bet they're fucking off right now. I bet they're not - dude, you could hit me up on Christmas Day. I'll message you back.
[34:02] Okay? Because again, I'll be sitting there typing a webinar SOP for you guys. My point being, okay, not saying you don't participate in Christmas or that it's bad. I'm not trying to demonize. I'm genuinely not.
[34:14] Like when I have a family one day, I'll absolutely participate with them and all that fun stuff. Okay? Not trying to demonize it.
[34:22] I'm just saying remember there's the dogs out there that are isolated during this time of year. And it's best to adapt communication to them specifically because that's who you're going to maximize revenue with during this time of year specifically, this like 11-day gap. Okay.

[34:40] Max says, "I'm assuming you flip this Jan 3rd with the new year, new me mindset." Yes. Yeah. Good, good, good emphasis.
[34:48] So, let's move past like the end of the year and let's talk about this upcoming year now. So, during January specifically, like the literal first days of January.
[34:58] Well, let me actually just close out with this by the way. I love running the for the dogs ads like now. Like I'll happily run them literally through Christmas.

VISUAL: Estratégia de reativação de ads no dia de Natal, aproveitando queda dramática de CPMs
[35:10] If I am not going to adapt my messaging with for the dogs communication, just as a caveat, if I'm not going to do this, I'm flicking my normal ads back on on Christmas Day.
[35:22] Okay, on Christmas Day CPMs drop like a rock again. If I am not doing for the dogs communication, I will very happily just start running ads again on Christmas onward.
[35:34] Most of my clients' ads right now are off besides the hammer them ads unless they've adapted to the for the dogs communication. On Christmas Day, I'll flick them all back on to be clear. Okay?
[35:46] And I'll just run as normal through the new year on Christmas Day forward. Okay?
[35:52] I want to be very fair and saying if you are judged on a month over month basis on ROI or that's how you look at your own returns, I want to be clear when I say this.
[36:04] You'll have, you know, obviously some lag to that revenue coming back. Like it'll typically come back in the first and second week of January.
[36:12] When you have that Christmas through New Year's revenue that goes out the door on ad spend, it generally doesn't come back within those days. It loads up the calendar and it seeds the pipeline for January.
[36:26] We find that if we start having sales communications with people between the 26th and the 31st, yes, there's a much higher probability we'll get the excuses of, I'd rather do this in January.
[36:38] But that's okay because then we're going to have a monster January. And we're okay with having some of that too as like a buildup, kind of like a dam, you know, and then we bust open the dam in that first and second week of January and get all these people closed.
[36:54] Okay, that's why specifically I'm happy to just run things as normal again on Christmas forward. That is if this is the caveat.
[37:02] If you are comfortable with having a bunch of January excuses and just having a big January for those six to seven days of spend you're essentially going to lose that you're not going to maximize daily within that time frame. Does that make sense everybody?

[37:20] Okay, we got a few things in the chat. "Would you only give the incentive to people who pay in full or all sales this time of year?"
[37:28] Yeah, it's really just a pay in full incentive. Andrew, great question to get some clarity on that. It's the for the dogs incentive is a PIF discount. I do not do that with people who do payment plans.
[37:42] See, Kristoff shared an image in the chat that says from other groups: "As we prepare to celebrate the Christmas and New Year holidays, we want to remind everyone that we will be doing no coaching calls from December 23rd until January 1st."
[37:56] Gay, that's awful. Sorry to hear that. Hate to see other people abandon you.
[38:02] Michael says, "We normally run end of the year sale ads starting Christmas. We have a client who does 4 to 500K between Christmas and New Year's. Like Jay is saying, it filters into early January, too."
[38:14] Yes, exactly. That's this is the main thing I want to emphasize with this for why specifically we turn it on on Christmas. There's multiple reasons.
[38:24] Number one, CPMs drop like a rock. Therefore, ad costs drop like a rock. Two, I'm trying to seed January.
[38:32] Three, we find that a lot of people have a really hard time disconnecting completely and they have like a state of anxiousness that develops where they need to do something work or productivity related between that time frame.
[38:46] And we are happy to exploit that with whatever offers we are advertising on behalf of clients or even our own offers.
[38:54] We like to exploit the anxiousness simply put that develops by fucking off for even just a few days at a time. We find that most of the population is in that state where they obviously know their entire lives and their stability are associated with their work outcomes.
[39:10] And as they fuck off and do nothing, anxiousness grows. So therefore, they feel backed up and get right back to work.
[39:18] Final thing, we also find that when people sit around with their families for long enough that they don't actually sit there and talk with their families.
[39:26] Instead, what they do is they get on their phones and they're just going to scroll at a higher daily hourly rate than they otherwise would compared to a normal day in order to kind of disconnect from sitting with their families all day.
[39:40] So, we actually find that there's a higher quantity of people online compared to offline. So, we want to be there and be serving ads to those people as well during that time frame.

[39:54] Kristoff says, "If you run ads on the 24th, do you open up the calendar more than 3 days?" Yeah. And again, this is why I also run on Christmas.
[40:04] Christmas this year is on a Wednesday and we like doing the normal three-day thing. So, we would like to start booking Thursday and Friday and Saturday's calendars and just keep it as normal.
[40:16] I do not ever like to open it up past three days. If you are going to run literally on Christmas Eve though, then yes, I would assume you'd have to open it up a fourth day depending on how many booking slots are available and all that fun stuff.
[40:30] Sanjay says "CPMs drop like crazy even on the 26th, right?" Yeah. After Christmas, CPMs drop like a rock.
[40:38] It's important to understand there's this quote, "70% of the entire year's ad spend is spent in Q4." And that's true. It's from Facebook directly.
[40:48] And most of those are ecom guys. You would be amazed in shock and awe with how much money is made from these ecom boys during this time of year.
[40:58] I have friends that make without exaggeration millions to tens of millions of dollars during these three months. And they make like shit all during the other nine months out of the year.
[41:10] Like they barely advertise. They play into the macro perspective of what this time of year caters to which is in their bias to be fair.

[41:22] The other thing that happens right after Christmas is what we call budget dumping. So there are certain companies, very big companies in particular, that have budgets.
[41:32] And if they fail to spend their entire budget, they will get their budget reduced the following year. You will potentially, given the demographic you're targeting, still see some inflated costs right after Christmas or even right now through the end of the year.
[41:48] Specifically from these major corporations, just fire hose and spend, emptying the fire hydrant out so they don't get a cut the following year.
[41:58] That's the only other time that you really see CPMs given specific niches still high from Christmas onward through the end of the year.

VISUAL: Calendário detalhado de Janeiro, mapeamento de comportamento de compra pós-festas, lag period
[42:10] Okay, let's talk January real quick. Let me take a sip of water real fast.
[42:16] All right. So, January onward, little bit different. CPMs drop, life's back to normal. However, you do have a little bit of a lag, what we call the catch-up period.
[42:28] So, people, let's look at the dates specifically so I can be very particular with you guys. January 1st is on a Wednesday, so that's New Year's Day.
[42:38] People are going to be hung over, fucked up, catching up, etc. from the first probably through about the 11th.
[42:46] Reason being again a lot of people are just going to let their staff and as a business they're going to let themselves take off from essentially the 1st through the 5th. The first being a Wednesday, the fifth being a Sunday.
[43:00] I mean look, if you're going to take off that Wednesday and Tuesday, you might as well just call it a long weekend is going to be the mindset of most of these people.
[43:10] Then what happens between the 6th and the 10th, which is essentially the second week of January, everybody plays catch-up. So everybody starts to try to get ahead of what they put off over the final two weeks of the year and those first couple days of January.
[43:26] Everything essentially goes back to normal after that. So in some instances, you have like a slight lagging indicator to when people are really going to start to buy and like everything goes back to normality again.
[43:38] Now in some instances, depending on what you sell, it's actually quite the opposite where like, dude, as soon as new year hits or even the days leading up to New Year, you actually get a flood of buyers because you sell something that has to do with new year momentum.
[43:54] Think of like the fitness niche as a great example of this. Think of really just any kind of product or service that has like an outcome that people would want to add to their new year, new me kind of perspective.
[44:08] Any kind of offer like that, you have a really high probability that people will continue to purchase during that time of year and you won't be delayed.
[44:18] If you have something that's easy to push off that doesn't necessarily contribute to the - I don't really know what the word here is - like the mindset of like this is a priority to me right now. I must do it now. This is going to like create my momentum for the new year.
[44:34] If you got something that's just easier to push off that isn't a part of their list, like their master goal list, you're probably going to get pushed off till about that second week, maybe even the third week when they're officially caught up. Just kind of keep that in mind.

[44:50] All messaging, there is no like for the dogs communication. You essentially recede on all for the dogs communication types during that January 1st onward. You just pull that messaging out.
[45:04] And I want to be very clear when I say this. Like sure you could do like the new year, new me hook. I personally I'm not a fan of that.
[45:14] I like to do like the accountability version of that which is: "Name one year where you've actually said new year, new me and made it happen."
[45:24] "Like what's caused that failure to occur has been no - you haven't had a proper system. You clearly if you've invested into anything in the past that's all failed you. You can blame that business as a result of that."
[45:38] "I've got the system that'll finally get you the results you're looking for." And I'd love to then focus my ads and my messaging around systems that create results.
[45:48] Systems that create results are what typically are the most focused on during that new year.
[45:54] Kind of like how - I mean look kind of cheesy to be fair because like I don't know about you guys. Can you guys tell me real quick from a consensus perspective? Do you actually participate in the new year, new me thing?
[46:06] Put a one if you do in the chat. Put a two if you do not. Like I'm a two as an example. I'm on my shit all the time. I do not get off my edge and have to catch up at the new year on some shit.
[46:20] You know, I'm on my game 24/7, 365. Don't give a fuck what the year is, who the president is, you know, that kind of thing.
[46:28] Here's the thing, though. It's also important that you pepper in that hook. By the way, look in the chat. It's all twos.

[46:38] So, if you sell to like higher level people that are rich trying to get richer, it's very important that you consider what I just gave you perspective on, which is they're not going to relate to your new year, new me shit.
[46:50] They're going to think you're a loser if you participate new year, new me. You know, they're going to be - the better hook for people that are already doing well, trying to do even better is that exact hook, which is:
[47:04] "Look, man, this whole new year, new me stuff. Yeah. Like, you don't relate to that. Like, you're already on top of your game. You're rich trying to get a hell of a lot richer than you are right now. I got the perfect system for you, okay?"
[47:18] "And I'd love to add it to you during this time of year to get you some momentum at the start of the year. Like let's get this done in January so you finish 2025 with the results of what you're going to start to habitualize and learn and adapt to today with me and the system that I have for you."
[47:36] That is a far better hook if you're selling to that type of demographic. So again, the perspective here is like look, if you're selling to people that do participate in the new year, new me mindset, great do that. That's more the general public.
[47:50] The affluent version of that hook is: "Look man, you're already doing good. I just want to help you do a hell of a lot better. And I'd rather you start experiencing the results of what we can do together towards the middle and end of the year."
[48:04] "But that starts today. As you know, you don't get results instantly. It's like, well, we got to spend some time together so we can plant those seeds and get those trees growing towards the middle and the end of the year here. So, let's pull the trigger today. Press this link. I got you. And excited to help."
[48:22] Does that make sense to everybody? Okay. Does anybody have any questions on everything that we've just talked about here today? Anything you guys need clarity on of what I've talked about? Anything you guys want to add?

[48:38] [PARTICIPANT]: Yeah, this is slightly different. I know it's like for the future, but really what you're talking about is like the psychographics of someone who's like likely to take action during a time when most people aren't, right? Like people in this group.
[48:52] I guess my question for you would be even in the new year, how could you adapt your messaging to relate more to people like that?
[49:00] Oh, it's the same general hook and what I just described instead of the new year, new me hook. Again, it's just - okay. So, as a few months pass, you can give the perspective of - have you ever heard Elon say, "What did you accomplish this week?"
[49:16] [PARTICIPANT]: No, but I get the idea.
[49:18] I love this. Okay, so Elon buys Twitter. The CEO of Twitter, that Indian dude at the time, was like saying some leftist hippie shit about taking care of people and yada yada. You know what Elon responded with?
[49:32] He - I'm not joking. He literally just said, "What did you accomplish this week?" To the hippie shit that he said.
[49:40] You know how many people on earth like immediately that give a fuck about productivity like immediately celebrated that and immediately like - I know people really tattooed that on themselves because of how much perspective it gives on how a guy like Elon operates.
[49:56] And the productivity that that man has clearly mastered and the level of which he openly holds his staff accountable to when they just start talking about shit he just says, "What did you accomplish this week?"
[50:08] So, as like as an example, you're into February and March. The hooks can also start to adapt around: "Look, you're a couple months into 2025, okay? What have you really got done?"
[50:22] "You know, I - you and I like we're not those 'oh, new year, new me' people, but seriously, like what have you accomplished this year? You got your birthday coming up soon. You're going to be another year older and you still, my friend, have not gotten the traction that you are looking to get."
[50:40] "You're spinning the wheels. I've got what you need. I've got the system for you. You know, look at what I've got. I put together this perfect thing. You know, press the button."
[50:50] You start using those kind of hooks as you get a little further away from January. And then to be clear, generally, you abandon it from there.
[50:58] Once you get in April onward, I don't know, the accountability hooks don't even necessarily land that well. You know, it's just right after New Year and like in the new year that that really resonates. You get what I mean?
[51:12] [PARTICIPANT]: Yes.
[51:14] Okay, cool. What's going on, Mason? A little late.
[51:18] [MASON]: Yeah. Sorry, brother.
[51:20] No, it's okay. Make sure you watch the first part of the call. We were just ending it and asking if anybody had any questions.

[51:40] [MASON]: Easy one for you. Do you think if you were starting an offer in like car sales niche, kind of hypothetical, would - do you think you would have better luck, especially with colder traffic, talking to people like more like a BISOP where it's like if you want to get into car sales and make six figures a year, like start from zero, or the guys who - the average car sales guy in America, hundreds of thousands of guys make like 40k a year on average and bringing them up to six figures. What makes more sense to sell?
[52:12] Say the first demographic again. Taking the people who are already in there to six figures or what was the first one?
[52:18] [MASON]: First one is taking people who don't do car sales and getting them into it and getting them competent enough to make money.
[52:26] Great question. I'm always a fan of in-market demographics first. And that's really a product question.
[52:34] Like if I have a product that's more built for the people who are new to car sales, my in-market demographic would technically be people who aren't in it but want to get in it already.
[52:46] I wouldn't communicate to people who don't want to get in it that aren't in it yet. I would communicate to the people who are in it that want - that - I'm sorry that aren't in it that want to get in it.
[52:58] That would be the in-market there versus the people who are already in it that might want to make more. Again, product question would be is that hypothetical product built for people that are already in it?
[53:10] You get what I mean? Because I'd be adapting it to one or the other if it was built for one or the other. But again, I always want to consider in-market demographics first. That's where you're most profitable at. You see what I mean?
[53:24] Like take you as an example, right? With your copywriting offer, you have two ways to look at. You have just as simple of an analysis.
[53:32] Do I want to help people who are already in the digital marketing world like adapt to learning copywriting? Probably not. People who are already in digital marketing are probably quite savvy to like all these AI tools that have popped up.
[53:46] They probably minimized their need to like write copy themselves and develop that skill as a result. I know I for sure don't think I'm hiring a copywriter anytime in the near future.
[53:56] But my point being the people who are on the fence about wanting to get into the digital marketing world, I think it is easier than ever before to convince that person you can leverage artificial intelligence, which is a global thought that is already in people's heads.
[54:12] To get into the digital marketing world, have a skill you can run from anywhere in the world, at the least at your home, leveraging AI tools to do the easiest digital marketing skill set that exists.
[54:26] Now, that's still a revenue driven skill set. That'd be the demographic I'd be tripling down on if I was you. Does that make sense?
[54:34] [MASON]: You're talking about newbies that have no idea.
[54:36] I'm talking about people who want to get into the internet money world.
[54:40] [MASON]: Gotcha.
[54:42] Know about AI and I could tie those two things together to sell them on it's copywriting.
[54:48] [MASON]: Okay.
[54:50] Does that make sense?
[54:52] [MASON]: Right. So for the copywriting thing, it's like people who already have the idea, they want to get into it, and then here's how you do it. For the car sales thing though, you're saying it's way better to target people who are already doing car sales or...
[55:06] What's the product? What's the - again, it's all product specific? If you didn't have a product and you were just picking, is that what your hypothetical is?
[55:14] [MASON]: Yeah.
[55:16] Again, I mean, you could technically ask yourself like, "All right, do you want to sell to a more sophisticated buyer or do you want to talk about like noob shit and like sell to somebody who you're getting into the game, you know?"
[55:28] Because as an example, I don't like telling - helping somebody go from literally zero to like 10K a month. I think that's so whack, you know? Like, I wouldn't want to do that.
[55:38] I love helping people go - I think 100k a month is like prison, you know? It's like life really starts to open up at 100K a month. A million a month is like, oh, it's my favorite game to play, dude.
[55:50] You know, so I'd build a product around that. If I was that car sales guy in this example, the question would be like, do I want to talk to the people that are already in car sales so I could have a more sophisticated conversation?
[56:04] Or would I want and desire to talk to like - would you want to be a Russell Brunson, you know, that like helps people just sell online? Like his most recent challenge was learn how to sell online.
[56:16] I'd cry. I'd cry if I had to do that. I'd find like - no I wouldn't find that fun at all. You know what I mean? But Russell loves that shit.
[56:26] So again, like what type of car salesman do you want to be? Car salesman trainer, I should say. Does that make sense? Because again, that would be what defines the demographic is the product. You get what I'm saying?
[56:40] [MASON]: It's not about what's better. It's about what the guy would prefer.
[56:44] It's about what the guy would prefer.
[56:46] [MASON]: And then again, from there, that defines the demographic based on the product. And the demographic should be the in-market demographic because that's the easiest party to sell to that makes you the most money initially and that you should scale into first logically out of any other demographic.
[57:02] [MASON]: Gotcha. Cool. Awesome. Thank you.
[57:06] Yeah. Okay. Cool. Does anybody have questions on what we talked about here today? Anybody before we head out?
[57:16] All right. Cool. Great having you here with us as always. Thank you for being here. And by the way, look at that. We have a new member, Vlad.
[57:24] Vlad, welcome in. Looks like you replaced Nick that got booted. Congratulations. Looking forward to meeting you. Talk soon everybody.
