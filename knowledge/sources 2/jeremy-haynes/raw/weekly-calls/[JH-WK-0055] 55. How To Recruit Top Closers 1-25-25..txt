Transcrição Completa: 55 How To Recruit Top Closers 1 25 25
[00:00] All right. In this video, we're going to be talking about how to recruit top closers. Okay. So, most of you guys are in a position where you're selling something that's like a high ticket product or service. And the one thing that really holds a business back after they figure out marketing is getting top closers into the business on a consistent basis.
[00:20] Okay. Now, historically, what I've taught and what we've also done has been we've tapped into these Facebook groups. Okay. And there's all kinds they're essentially closer job Facebook groups. And there's dozens of them and each one of them give or take the group size and who runs it has upwards of tens of thousands of people within it.
[00:40] Most of them are turds to be fair. So when you look at these closer Job Facebook groups, the main thing that you have to understand is is you're going to do a lot of vetting. Okay? Which is one thing that holds a lot of you back from taking action on that specific strategy.
[00:56] So I'll leave that specific strategy for the tail end of the video because it is still very effective. However, it does require you to technically invest just as much time and effort as though you posted on like ziprecruiter.com and tried to get a traditional like job board posting and then sat there and fielded and vetted out all the applicants that come through.
[01:18] So, one of my favorite things, and this is something that um not necessarily all of you are going to be able to do because not all of you have a bunch of closers that want to make a fuckload of money that follow you, okay? That's posting on your Instagram stories.

[01:35] So, it's super simple to do. All I functionally do when I execute this is I go on my Instagram, I take like some random photo and I type a few things out and there are very simple instructions.
[01:46] So, first thing I do, I say top closers wanted for X. Okay? And that X is whatever the offer name is or whatever the company name is. Sometimes I've even tested like putting the offer there. the offer being like top closers needed for a 15K offer as an example of something I might type.

NÚMEROS: $20,000-$50,000 por mês
VISUAL: Fórmula de atração de closers top, range salarial destacado, estrutura de comissão
[02:08] Okay. From there, I make sure that I put some essentially like almost like top closer bait. You know, I'm trying to chum the waters with things that actually appeal to a top closer. Top closers are very simple to understand in terms of what they want. They want 20 to $50,000 per month in a commission role.
[02:27] Okay? So, you have to first ask yourself like, do you actually have an offer that can attract that type of closer in the first place? If you don't as a business have the capacity to pay a closer that type of of I don't salary essentially through commission, then you're fucked You don't even stand a chance to acquire these types of people in the first place.
[02:48] You're going to get more of a regular closer. Now, I want to be really clear like we've talked about this in the inner circle in the past where when I bring up the fact that true top closers like a player top closer talent, they always want 20 to 50k a month and obviously more than that if they can.
[03:06] You know, the the immediate refute is is like, well, not every closer is going to be able to get paid that amount. And that's true. But my point is is like you want the people who aspire to that level of commission on a month-to-month basis because those are the people that are going to be the most money hungry and the people that are going to push your business financially upward and to the right.
[03:28] Okay. So, moral of the story, I like posting on Instagram stories for my closers and I typically get a strong network effect as a result of that. When I first started doing this, it's not like I had a bunch of closers just sitting there following me. It was the fact that as soon as that story is posted, it's on a social media platform that can get shared to a fuckload of other people right away.

[03:52] Okay? And that's what's important to understand about it. I'm going to get some guy who knows a person that might want to work for me to share it to somebody else who he knows that he considers to be a top closer or she knows. you know, I'm going to have the business owners that follow me that, you know, might be in a position where they're like winding down, but they've got some top talent that currently works for them that they want to take care of and they want to push into a a good business.
[04:18] Again, that's going to get shared over to that person. So, the first two lines, just to be clear, top closers needed for blank offer. And then to be clear, you would then want to say uh income potential in the 20 to 50k a month range, commissiononly job.

NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Regra de exclusão de agências de vendas, exceções específicas mencionadas (Josh Troy, Wires from Strangers)
[04:37] And this is one of the most important parts of this Instagram story strategy. You then say no sales agencies. Okay? Although quite literally there is one sales agency that I am preferential towards. It's a guy named Josh Troy with Wires from Strangers. I fucking hate sales agencies besides Josh.
[04:56] Okay? Almost all of them suck. I also want to give a shout out to two inner circle members that do quite well, but they're currently maxed out. They don't necessarily have more capacity, and that's Kaden and Trey.
[05:07] Okay? So, there are like little pocket niche sales agencies that have done well. Like, we had one client, this uh guy named Brian with an Airbnb offer. He was doing a couple hundred a month. There was a there was a a young guy, his name was Caleb. And Caleb came in and marketed himself as a sales agency.
[05:25] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Case Study: Sales Agency Success"

[05:27] And this was his first client as a sales agency. It was a bunch of young guys. You know, Caleb himself was like young 20some at the time. And uh they scaled that business up to like $2 million a month with me. You know, we got that thing up to about 2.3 million a month at its peak in one particular month. and uh consistently were clearing $2 million months or high million.
[05:50] And long story short, they ended up just not taking on any other deal and only exclusively working on that one particular client from how much commission they were making as a sales agency off that one account. And that's what a good sales agency should do.
[06:03] If they if they are not highly skilled operators like what Josh is with wires from Strangers, then you just you end up not being able to use them because as soon as they take on a few extra deals, like sales is an extremely time and effort intensive thing.
[06:18] So again, no sales agencies. We want to make that super clear. Okay, very important to understand. Now, after that, you then want to have your qualifier for what you want them to do.

[06:32] Okay, so it's essentially four lines total. I need a top closer for this offer. This is the income range potential. Absolutely no sales agencies. And then the fourth and final thing that we want to make sure that we pepper in there is we want to make sure that we specifically say, "Okay, I want you to do this to show me that you're the right person."

NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Critérios de avaliação via selfie video: aparência, tonalidade, energia, ambiente, vestimenta, higiene
[06:52] Okay. And usually I have somebody send me a selfie video. Selfie videos put the closer on display for how they look, how they talk, their tonality, you know, what specifically they're wearing, what their environment looks like.
[07:04] Like whether you want to acknowledge it or not, human beings make snap judgments about everything all the fucking time. Okay? And you don't want to be in the position where you don't do the exact same and exploit that.
[07:16] Okay? Make a snap judgment off of people when they make these videos to you. That's exactly what your customers are going to do when they get a selfie video from that person later on if and when they're ever working for you.
[07:28] So, think of it like your customer, you know, like what do you think of the video? What do you think of their environment? What do you think about how they presented themselves? Blah blah blah. Okay, so moral of the story, Instagram stories is one of my favorite things to do.
[07:42] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Instagram vs Facebook Groups Comparison"
NÚMEROS: Instagram: 20-50 candidatos, Facebook: centenas de candidatos
VISUAL: Comparação de qualidade vs quantidade, ratio de closers qualificados, volume de estrangeiros
[07:44] I love it. It's consistently bringing in a a pretty fair amount. Like when I do the Facebook group strategy, I can get hundreds of people and you'll get a lot of foreigners and like we'll talk about that strategy here again towards the tail end of the video because it's it just it gets you so much volume that you then got to vet through that it becomes a very like time and effort intensive thing.
[08:06] With Instagram stories, it's like I might get 20 to 50 people that'll come in, but they'll be a lot better. like the ratio simply put of like good quality closures that come in as a result of that strategy is far greater comparatively to our uh our Facebook strategy.
[08:22] Okay, so Instagram stories is one of my consistent go-tos. Now, you might not be able to execute that. Like sometimes my inner circle students when they come in uh you know and they need a closer right away, it's like you know I'll help them out and I'll post something on my story and I'll tag them and like I'll tell top closers to go and you know hit those guys up.
[08:42] But the thing with the inner circle is just like I don't want you guys to be reliant on me, you know, and I'm not trying to be a dick or anything and just like not help you out, you know? I obviously want to help you out. That's the incentive of what you pay to be a part of in this group, but I want to be very clear when I say this, like you should try to do it on your stories first and see if you can get the same network effect that I have.

VISUAL: Estratégia de construção de rede própria, independência de terceiros, crescimento orgânico de network
[09:06] Okay? I don't think that you're that much different from me in your ability to just start building up like a closer network. And then what happens is is this is this is one reason that I do like posting on behalf of the inner circle and and telling people like, "Hey, go work for this specific company."
[09:22] When you guys do have good opportunities that can pay people that type of income range and I get to post about those things more frequently, it strengthens my network as well. So, another like little caveat of this approach is if you have an opportunity to not only post for your own business, but maybe for one of your buddies that has like a good offer that can again attract and retain a top closer, you should be posting on your story for their job opportunities as well because the more job opportunities that you post for closers, the more top closers and the more sales people in general are going to be following you.
[09:54] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Content Strategy for Closer Attraction"
NÚMEROS: 4 horas de treinamento de vendas mencionado, 2023
VISUAL: YouTube video strategy, sales training course, Hydra strategy, conteúdo educacional para atrair salespeople
[09:56] Okay. Now, there is one thing. This is um something that again was like a very like time and effort intensive approach. It was this YouTube video strategy. I did a 4hour long uh sales training course. And I created this sales training course out of pure rage and frustration back in uh 2023 I think.
[10:15] And this specific sales training was built for high ticket closers who were using one of my strategies called the hydra. And it ended up just being extremely valuable for like call funnels and everything else in between. Anyway, I digress. The point I'm trying to make is very simple. This YouTube video also did the same thing, but on technically a lower scale. It attracts salespeople to follow me.
[10:36] Okay, that's the one thing I want to make extremely clear. It doesn't have to be a 4-hour long super fucking incredibly valuable sales training course that you drop for free on the internet on YouTube to attract closers. But it's like, hear me out, right? A little bit of content here and there going towards salespeople and demonstrating that you know what you're talking about as a salesperson. also helps tremendously with attracting closers to follow you and just be there for when you post the Instagram stories.

NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Sistema de referência entre A-players, network de top closers, conexões de alto nível
[11:08] Hiring these top closers also comes from referrals. Okay, referrals is a very consistent way to attract and retain top closers into your business. Okay, this is a triedand-rue strategy right here. You likely already know somebody that's great at what they do as a closer. Whether they're in your business or whether they're in somebody else's business, doesn't matter at all.
[11:28] Okay? Top A players, no network, hang out, interact consistently with other A players. Okay? A player standards are so high, they get fucking enraged when they have to be around B and C players in life.
[11:42] So, long story short, a very consistent approach is referrals from other top closers that you already know. I want to be very clear when I say this. The one thing that can also hold back a business from getting good referrals is that the person who's doing the referring doesn't actually trust that you're going to be able to follow through with a great opportunity.

[12:04] So, you have to have your shit together. You know, like you can't be a business that's making fucking all money, like tens of thousands of dollars a month, and think you're going to attract the top closer because they can see right through that. You know, it's like think about people like I I as an example have gone to San Francisco an unbound amount of times to specifically go to Menllo Park and Facebook's headquarters out there.
[12:28] And every single time I go there, there is there is this culture in San Francisco of like they call them 10x engineers, okay? And there are these software developers and programmers and developers that work in all these major tech companies. And they don't just work for Facebook, they work for every single major tech company that you can sit there and think of, okay?
[12:48] and they all trust and feel empowered by the big tech companies that they work for because they are multi-undred billion dollar and in some instances trillion dollar companies. Okay. Do I trust Facebook if I'm an engineer, developer, programmer, whatever that they can pay me low hundreds of thousands of dollars a year plus stock options and a vesting schedule. And can I actually trust that? Of fucking course I can't. They're a multiundred billion dollar and trillion dollar company give or take which company you're referring to.

Okay. Most of their employees and this was even this is an even crazier stats like high 30% of their entire employee base had a net worth from their stock options alone of more than 10 plus million dollars.
[13:48] Okay, that's a company where people have confidence they can get rich as fuck Okay, that's essentially the culture you got to give off as a business who wants to attract and retain not just one good closer but many good closers.

[14:04] It's like good closers and just a players in general can see right through the smoke screen that you might be trying to put up of the frivolous fucking front that most businesses have of like, "Yeah, we can retain and pay you extremely well." It's like, "Well, fucking prove it." You know, like my top closer, as an example, in the month of December made like $42,08, okay? My like lowest closer made like 20some thousand.
[14:28] Okay? I can sit there and I can transparently show and let potential prospect closers talk to my existing sales staff. My sales staff can hard flex that they get paid again like low to mid couple hundred grand a year and they get to learn a fuckload of stuff.
[14:44] Okay, this is important to understand. Although yes, again the referral network's great. If you find yourself not being able to successfully get referrals, you might be in a position where your business just looks like shit and people don't want to come work for you because you're not giving off the vibes that you're going to be able to pay.

[15:04] This is important to understand. It's like, as silly as this might sound, and I'm not trying to sit here and hard flex on you or anything. It's like, dude, I got two Ferraris, a Rolls-Royce, you know, like I got a fucking Range Rover SVR. Sometimes people don't even know what a fucking SVR is. It's their race division. It's it's a it's a sick car. It's not like one of those fucking regular Range Rovers, you know, comes out of the factory with like all the crackle pops and all this other cool shit on it.
[15:30] And uh my point is is like, dude, I live I have two houses in the same city, you know? Like one of them is a penthouse at the top of a nice building. My balcony is bigger than most people's apartments. You know what I mean? My second home is fucking sweet.

You can look at me on almost any social platform and not just say, "Oh, that guy's one of those people that's like a fucking taking a photo on his Lamborghini hood." It's like, "No, dude. I'm not hard flexing on shit I don't own. I'm not living a life where it's not transparent that I'm actually rich." Like, dude, I've been rich for like a decade, you know, and I keep getting richer and richer.
[16:12] there's uh vocabulary terms and like ways people live where it's just super authentic and you can just tell that somebody's getting money, you know? And as silly as it might sound, when I go look at certain people that do make great money, but they live like fucking violently horrendous lifestyles where they drive like shitty cars, you know, it's like somebody in the NFL that gets paid tens of millions of dollars a year that pulls up in like a fucking Honda Accord.

VISUAL: Filosofia de "overflowing cup", generosidade demonstrável, cultura de abundância vs escassez
[16:38] you know, you just as as silly as it might sound, you know, you just don't think that those people are getting money as a result of that. This isn't like that day and age where it's the millionaire next door where uh you know, super conservative people are who everybody looks up to, you know, and like that wealth whisper fucking I mean, I it's just my point I'm trying to make is again, as silly and as pretentious as it might sound, you have to show people that like you're getting money because the level of income that you're at visibly will correlate directly to the level of money that people who work for you think they're going to make as a result.
[17:14] There's that classic lesson of like the cup overflows into the people around you, right? Well, if you got a fucking tiny shot glass for your cup and it barely leaks over into the people around you, that's a good example of why you might not be getting top closers. Comparatively, it's like I can tip a valet $100, you know, or like go and, you know, if I go to a place, it's like I buy everybody food and stuff.
[17:36] We just had an event at my building and uh we fed the entire staff of the building. It was like 50 people on top of the 60 people we had at our event for the inner circle mastermind. I bought off every fucking person in the building with like hundreds of dollars each in cash to make sure that fucking event went well.
[17:54] You see what I mean? Like that's a cup. It's like a bucket, you know, that's just fucking you're in the splash zone when you're around me is my point, right? And that's what I'm trying to emphasize. People can tell when they're around the right people, they get richer, okay? And when they're around the wrong people, they will go broke and they will not be getting as much money.
[18:14] So, as silly as that sounds, like you got to play the part. You got to play the part. You got to look the part. And you got to be the fucking person. Okay? And this is an undermined tactic. And I'm trying to emphasize it, not just to sit here and fucking yap too much.
[18:28] The uh the point I'm trying to make is simple. Like, people can tell whether they actually have a high probability to get some serious fucking money working with you or not. Okay? and the people who do want to get serious money in life will be more than happy to work with you if you give off that vibe.

So, in the Facebook group method, there's a specific post that I like to use and it's a little more thorough in comparison to the Instagram stories because we have to do a lot more vetting. So, we put we want to put more friction in place so we can just easily vet through people faster and deter the wrong folks.

That's all you're going to type in. High ticket closer. And then you're going to click on that little groups button. And when you do that, you're going to see like there are dozens of these groups that say like high ticket closer job opportunities, high ticket closer. And then they're all like named like something a little different, you know.
[19:42] And some of them don't even necessarily say that they're for jobs. Some of them are just for high ticket closers. And you want to penetrate those groups as well because after you do, you're going to post a job opportunity for that community and try to get somebody paid buku bucks.
[19:56] Okay. So, long story short, when you go into these groups, it starts off with obviously you just kind of looking at the group and making sure first of all it's a place where people are posting jobs. If you do go into one of the groups that's not explicitly labeled for job opportunities, just be mindful of the fact you might get kicked out in the instance you try to post a job.
[20:14] And you know, you can simply put after you get let in, scroll through. I like being in the groups, by the way, for the closers that are not for job opportunities as well because it gives me a lot of perspective. What do these people want? What are they talking about? What are they bitching about? You know, like what are they looking for? Gives you a lot of perspective.

Again, the image should be something that's like something that represents you in the offer or whatever you're posting on behalf of if you're trying to recruit closers for clients. You have to have something that attracts attention and gets like that thumb stop while they're scrolling through the feed, but not something fucking ridiculous, you know? Like just post like a normal photo of you, but you know, get something that looks good.

NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Estrutura detalhada: oferta, descrição, preço, comissão, funções do role, responsabilidades do CRM
[21:06] Okay. The job post itself needs to be very descript. It's relatively the same as the Instagram post, just a little more articulate. So, it's top closers wanted for this offer. And then you need to describe what the offer is. And you need to be realistic. Okay? If anything, you want to be conservative and kind of make it sound appealing, but also like make sure you list all the things that are functions of the job that you're going to have the person do because there's a lot of shit that they're going to have to do with the CRM and following up and like a bunch of tedious shit that most people don't post about, but that's a lot of what I post about in those second and third lines.
[21:40] So, I say, "Okay, top closer needed for this." Um, right away I'm going to talk about the offer and the details. I'm going to say, "Okay, so it's this type of business. Um, this is like the offer details. This is how much it's priced at. This is the current commission structure. Here's the function of your role. You're responsible for doing XYZ."
[21:58] So, you might be filling up the person's calendars. And that's great. And if that's the case, awesome. Make sure to say that. But also make sure you say like, "You need to follow up with people. We expect all of our closers to send selfie videos. We expect all our closers to have an end of day report that's filled out. We expect all of our closers to manage and stay on top of the CRM. We expect all of our closers to use their downtime when somebody doesn't show up to follow up with people who should be showing up for following calls and that you know you've historically talked to.

[22:30] Uh we want our closers like sending texts from their iPhones. This is one of the best vetting characteristics, by the way, that there's there's these like fucking primadona closers and they hate doing this shit but it's a great like vetting characteristic to get somebody who's a fucking drama queen out of the vetting process straight away, which is we want all of our closers to have iPhones and be willing to text leads from those iPhones.
[22:54] Okay? To me and to almost every serious business owner I've met, they are more than willing to use their their cell phones and their personal numbers to reach out to leads and to establish contact with people who are going to give them money. Okay? I have only seen the drama queen closers bitch about the fact that they have to use their personal phones to like text leads.
[23:16] Okay? It just it just doesn't make sense to me because as a business owner and and this might sound a little silly, but at the end of the day, like I want serious people in my business, okay? I want people who if it's like fucking 10 p.m., uh they're going to pick up the phone or like text the lead in the instance that a lead text them at that time because they want to get that fucking commission, you know? They want the person to close.
[23:40] And are they probable to be looking at their work phone at that time? No. Are they probable to be sitting in the fucking CRM at that time? No, probably not. What are they probable to look at during that time? if a lead texts them and asks them a question, their personal fucking cell phone. You see?

VISUAL: Cultura de disponibilidade 24/7, comunicação com developers à meia-noite, mentalidade de hustle
[23:58] So, it's like I want all of our sales people to be connected. I want them to be plugged in. Like, I remember I was sitting there, I had my fiance, she was yapping to me about um oh dude, like you always talk to people at like 10, 11, like midnight. Like last night, I was on the phone at midnight with one of my AI developers talking to him about some stuff that we need to develop.
[24:20] And for the first like few times that she was exposed to me talking to people this late at night about business stuff, she brought up, she was like, "You don't think it's rude to like talk to some of these people this late into the night about business?" And I was like, "Do you understand how fucking money works? Like anybody who's serious about getting money wants to get money. It doesn't matter the fucking time of day that it is. They want to actively pursue business. And I don't see anything wrong with communing with communicating with people at whatever time of day.
[24:48] I have some of my my uh clients and people that we work with that wake up at like four or five in the morning like one of those people and I don't give a fuck if they, you know, shoot me a text at that time. It's like I'm gonna look at it when I look at it anyway. I'm going to communicate whatever I need to communicate when I want to communicate it simply because I'm going to probably forget about it if I don't in that moment. And your leads are no different, especially when you're selling to rich people with whatever your offers are.
[25:14] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "iPhone vs Android - Status Signal"
NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: iPhone = rich people, Android = poor people perception, quality de selfie videos, text reactions, caller ID features
[25:16] So, I want salespeople in that job post to be willing to use their personal cell phones. And they got to be iPhones. There is not a single fucking rich person on earth I know right now, maybe besides Bill Gates. I would highly doubt even Bill Gates uses a fucking Android phone. Okay? Android phones suck. Everybody associates them with poor people. It's just a known fact. Okay? Whether you like it or not, whether you agree or disagree, whether you're sitting here with an Android or not, it's just a matter of fact, okay? Rich people use iPhones.
[25:46] So, I want my closers to be using iPhones. There's a lot of benefit to that as well. Just besides status and what it signals, it uh it show it enables you to send selfie videos in a high quality way. I can send like a fucking three minute selfie video to somebody and it comes through just like how it looks on my iPhone. It doesn't degrade the quality. If I send that to somebody on an Android, it comes through like dog shit Okay? If I send a selfie video from an Android to any other phone, it comes through like dog shit because it compresses it.
[26:16] Okay? So, that's just one example. Plus, I get the opportunity to do the little reactions to texts that can be great for reminders. I can do that thing where I say like, "Hey, it's Jeremy." And then I can call the person and their iPhone will say, "Maybe it's Jeremy." You know, it's all kinds of little tips. I digress.
[26:32] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Commission Placement Strategy in Job Post"
NÚMEROS: 4º step na estrutura do post
VISUAL: Estratégia de enterrar a comissão, psychology de leitura completa, evitar abandono prematuro
[26:34] Okay. Point I'm trying to make is when I make that post about here's a job opportunity in a Facebook group, I want to make sure I say here's what I'm looking for. Here's the details of the offer opportunity. Here's what I'm looking for out of a closer. Okay? these are the most important variables, traits and characteristics of a closer to me and what we expect as a business of them to do. Then from there, I want to make sure I talk about the commission. I bury the commission for that fourth step in this case because yeah, I want people who are about the money, but I also don't want the person to just immediately take action after they see the income opportunity.
[27:08] The way human beings work is is once they feel like they got what they need and and can identify it's for them or or not, they just leave and they go take the action or they just go pay attention to something else. So moral of the story is if I start with the commission and somebody says, "Oh, I want to make that amount of money." They'll just immediately go and, you know, comment something like, "Hey, this is for me."
[27:30] So that's why we kind of bury it a little bit. We want people to read the expectations and what we expect of them first prior to us giving them the income opportunity. So after we list the commission potential, we then want to make sure we state what we want the person to do.
[27:46] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "High Friction Vetting Requirements"
NÚMEROS: 1 minuto de selfie video
VISUAL: Requisitos de alta fricção: selfie video de 1 minuto explicando por que deveria ser escolhido, detalhes de experiência
[27:48] So again, this is where we want to have a higher amount of friction comparatively to our normal like Insta story as an example or a referral model. We want to make sure that we say, I want you to send me a one minute selfie video on why it should be you and send me some details on your current closing experience. Okay? And if they can't follow those simple instructions, guess what? They're not going to follow all the other simple or complicated instructions that you give them to do in the fucking job.
[28:14] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Vetting Math & Time Management"
NÚMEROS: 60 videos × 1 minuto = 60 minutos, + 10 segundos navegação = 70 minutos total, 15-25% taxa de qualidade
VISUAL: Matemática de vetting, otimização de tempo, julgamentos rápidos nos primeiros 10-15 segundos
[28:16] Okay? So, if you get a lot of people that come through as a result of this, that's how you start vetting because let's let me just give you a simple example, right? Just for basic math. Let's say you get 60 one minute videos and it takes you 10 seconds on average to navigate between one person and the next. And you don't message a single person back. you just need to consume 61 minute videos. That right there alone is an hour of time. Assuming you watch them all from start to finish.
[28:44] Instead, what you want to do, like let's just again say that you get 60 videos as a result of taking this action. I want you to be super judgy. Okay? I want you to spend the first like 10 to 15 seconds max deeming if it's even worth it to continue watching this person's video. Like again things you want to judge on how they are as a person, their tonality, how they look, what their energy levels are, what their environment is, how they dress, uh hygiene, you know, like there's so many things that you just get, you know, little snapse second judgments on. And I want you to make those judgments quick.
[29:18] That way you preserve your own time and make this strategy faster because in comparison to spending a full 60 seconds on 60 fucking videos, if I spent 15 seconds on average, and you know, again, there's a handful of them for sure that you're going to watch. Ideally, a quarter of them, this is usually the stats, by the way, for this thing, ends up being about 15 to 25%. That that are actually going to be good. And these are people that you're going to have back and forth conversations with.
[29:44] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Voice Note Red Flag"
NÚMEROS: Não especificados
VISUAL: Voice notes = selfishness signal, lack of empathy, billionaire's angry face reactions, rich people hate voice notes
[29:46] I also want to be clear when I say this. There's some other things I want you to be mindful of. If you after you get their video text the person back like with some additional questions and they decide to send you a voice note, that is another thing that I am super judgy on that I have found is a great vetting characteristic as simple as it sounds.
[30:04] People who send voice notes to somebody who's rich and and they can't project empathy onto that person's situation. Like if that person doesn't have the self-awareness to think, man, this person probably just got blown up with closers and is actively vetting through a lot of people, oh, let me just selfishly send them a fucking voice note so they have to listen to the whole thing instead of just being able to rapidly move through this judgment cycle to get somebody into the job role. We don't want that type of person. It immediately signals selfishness.
[30:34] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Billionaire Voice Note Policy"
NÚMEROS: $1.1 billion net worth mencionado
VISUAL: Política de angry faces para voice notes, mesmo de Elon Musk, transcription issues com software antigo
[30:36] Simply put, if they send you a voice note, okay, one of the richest guys I know, he's worth $1.1 billion. Anytime a single person, doesn't matter who it is. Could it could be literally anybody on it. It could be fucking Elon messaging this guy a voice note. He sends them back angry angry faces. You know, voice notes are selfish. Rich people fucking hate voice notes. You should be the same.
[30:58] So anyway, point is you can be a little judgy on that. Make sure that uh you understand if they do that to you, they're going to do that to every fucking lead you have. And again, if you're selling to busy rich people, busy rich people don't listen to voice notes unless they can transcribe them. But I want to be fair and saying not every service allows them to transcribe the text given whatever software they're on. Nowadays, not everybody has the most recent iPhone. Not everybody has the most recent software update. Um, not everybody has the ability to transcribe messages. Simply put, some do, some don't. So, assumptively, you don't want your people sending voice notes. So, judge people negatively in that regard. Make them type it out.

NÚMEROS: 15-25% chegam ao primeiro round de entrevista, reduz para ~10% considerados bons
VISUAL: Processo de roleplay, vetting para inteligência adaptativa, não nerds mas smart adaptive people
[31:38] Um, okay. Beyond that, once you get them to the point where you found that 15 to 25% that's actually good and you feel confident about your ability to like officially take those people through an interview process. Here's how the interview process should look. You need to have like a little roleplaying session with these folks where you give them some information on the offer. You give them some information on like some leverage points that are generally talked about. And you want to essentially vet for intelligence.
[32:04] Like some of the smartest people on earth, like I'll give you a great example of this. Okay, as an educator, I can get a random business owner who can tell me just 30 seconds of details about their business and in like a snap second, I can think of the customer types that might be the most beneficial for them, in market demographics, how to communicate to those different demographics, what leverage points are available to pull and twist around, you know, to get somebody to close and have a high probability to respond.
[32:30] It's like there's a lot of shit that just immediately becomes available in my mind. And don't get me wrong, right? A decade of experience as a marketer, millions of dollars a month in ad spend. I understand that that develops that that psyche. But here's the thing I've understood about top closers is they have a very similar set of skills, but specific to sales leverage.
[32:48] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Case Study: Andrew's Closer Firing Cycle"
NÚMEROS: 15% close rate consistente, 6-8 closers contratados, 30 dias de trial period
VISUAL: Ciclo de contratar e demitir, padrão de 15% close rate, problema de vetting vs training
[32:50] Okay? You don't need a decade of experience in millions of dollars or hundreds of thousands of conversations to be able to develop that skill. It's a skill that people that aren't even in sales yet can readily tap into. You're vetting for intelligence in most instances in the first call. We're not looking for nerds. We're looking for people that just have like adaptive intelligence and are going to be able to come into your business and get results fast.
[33:14] That's the number one thing that almost all different like I had a guy inner circle member guy named Andrew. Shout out to Andrew if you're listening to this. He uh had two closers that came in that closed at 15%. He fired him because he was unsatisfied with their 15% close rate. He then had another like set of like upwards of six to eight closers come in after that. And the ones that were good, which were a majority of the people he hired were consistently closing around 15%. And instead of like accepting any responsibility that, you know, there's things that he could do better to train them, he just kept firing him and trying to get new closers.
[33:48] So I told him, I was like, "Look, dude, you got to fucking vet for adaptive intelligence. Like, if you're essentially looking for somebody and he would he would fire them within 30 days." So like he would give him a 30-day window of opportunity to essentially judge whether they were going to be good or not. And I understand why. I mean, to be fair to you guys, you're spending, you know, maybe tens of thousands of dollars to load up these people's calendars for the month. And if they whiff, it's like, you know, you just evaporated tens of thousands of dollars plus the time it took to train that individual. So, rightfully so, you're going to fire them quick. And I understand that. I'm not I'm not I'm not negligent to that.
[34:24] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "30-Day Growth Window"
NÚMEROS: 30 dias = 4 oportunidades semanais de crescimento
VISUAL: Janela de 30 dias, 4 vaults de crescimento, importância de adaptive intelligence para crescimento rápido
[34:26] But regardless, if that's going to be you and you're going to fire people on an every 30-day basis and you're going to try to find new people to swap into the game, you better be vetting for that adaptive intelligence attribute because that specific attribute alone as a characteristic is what is going to make the person get results faster.
[34:44] Like if you essentially treat it like they have one opportunity a week, okay, over a 30-day duration of time, that's four opportunities to have like a vault forward in their skills to get a higher close rate on behalf of your business to meet your minimum standards that you have for these individuals. I mean, dude, four opportunities to grow is not a lot. With adaptive intelligence as a characteristic that you vet for though, those four different vaults that they make to move forward and get a better result simply put in your business and improve their closing rate and improve their AOV, whatever it is, they um I mean, dude, without that characteristic, like they're going to need their handheld on exactly what to do with that specific attribute being in play. They're just going to know.
[35:26] they're going to have like a natural skill, simply put, to adapt quicker than the people who don't have it. That's what you're looking for. That can be vetted out easily in the interview process by ensuring that you go through roleplay scenarios. Okay? Give them the little bit of data that they need to think with and then act like you're on a sales call with them. Throw some different scenarios out there. you know, um, act like there's certain questions that come up in your sales process and see how they would answer it and just give them that little bit of information and see how impressive they come off. That's what you're looking for. You're looking for somebody who can impress you, you know?
[35:58] So, out of that 15 to 25% of people that you might get through all the way to the first round interview process, you'll probably cut it down to like 10% of the folks that come through all that uh, that are actually going to be considered good. you know, somebody that you actually have a probability to work with, you know, get results with and, you know, see if they're actually going to help make you money or not.

[36:22] So, anyway, these are all the top things, right? Close your job. Facebook groups, a great way to get a lot of people, but again, typically one of the last things that we'll do, one of the first things that we'll do is that IG story. We love the Instagram stories. They're so consistent. the YouTube videos and essentially just chumming the waters with some sales content in order to attract closers and sales people to your page and you know kind of have this like network effect that starts to grow is also important but it's like a subtask you know it's not necessarily a direct action to recruit.
[36:52] Referrals is a direct action to recruit though and it works really well but remember it only works really well when you look like you are going to be able to make that person a fuckload of money. Remember the example I provided with the cup overflowth. Okay. If you have a tiny little fucking cup that barely trickles over to the people around you and you look like you're the millionaire next door type of person that lives in the fucking suburbs somewhere in a tiny home or like a small apartment with a regular car, it's important to note like you're not going to attract the top closer because you don't look like you're getting a fuckload of money and so they don't think they're going to get a fuckload of money working with you.

That is the commonality that underlies every single thing I just said is this is all done on social media. So if you don't look like an impressive person, if you don't look like you're going to be able to overflow into the people around you and make the people who work with you a lot richer than they are now, I got bad news for you buddy. You are not going to attract top closers.

You're going to be in a position where you get like B and C player talent that could potentially turn into A player talent in the future, but it's going to take a fuckload of training time. It's going to take a lot a lot of training in order to bring that skill set out of those individuals. And some of you, I mean, to be fair, that's just where you have to start and it is what it is if that's the if that's the case.
[38:26] But look, I mean, there's a lot of impressive people that are sitting here watching this video right now. So, make sure you leverage that in order to bring top talent into the business. And then I want to be clear in saying this uh this interview process that I talked to you about. Interviews are typically boring, dull. You know, one party shows up prepared to ask questions, the other party shows up prepared to answer questions. In a closer interview, it should all be about, look, here's some information on the offer. Let's do some role paying. You know, let me let me throw out some common questions that come up on our sales calls and let's see how you answer them. That should be the interview process.

So, one of my buddies, his name's Brandon Carter, and Brandon has a fleet of salespeople that he uses. And all of his salespeople, the uh the one thing that's so funny about what he does, he tracks their macros, okay? He tracks their caloric intake. He tracks their fucking sleep. He has this app on their phone. It's like a mood tracker where once an hour on a scale of 1 to 10, they go put in their current mood with a number. 10 being the best, one being the worst, five being neutral.
[39:40] Okay, think about this. Like, if something goes wrong in your in the salespeople's personal lives that you're working with, it dramatically dramatically impacts their ability to close deals. Okay, Brandon is one of the most intrusive, overreaching examples I can provide to you, and that's why I use it that way.

He was making upwards like 30 to 50k a month, give or take the month, but this guy's personal life was so fucking chaotic, dude. It was like people were dying all the time. He had like different u all kinds of different problems, like car problems. And even at 30 to 50k a month, like you'd think like, oh, these guys can go and solve their issues because they get a lot of money. But no, I mean, dude, this guy was like sports betting, you know? I don't know how much he was sports betting. I'm not going to say he was blowing his whole check or something irresponsible like that, but uh he he would go on vacations with the money quite frequently.
[41:26] So, like he would make a little bit of money and then like he would hit us up and be like, "Oh, dude, I'm in Vegas for these next couple days." And it's, you know, like what do you think your closer is going to perform like on the following day of calls when they stayed up till like 4:00 a.m. fucking gambling and doing who knows what else, getting hammered.

You can also just on that same note when you're talking about personal life with closers, kind of start to ask questions about their goals and what they are going to do with the money that they make. I also find that quite valuable.
[42:12] So, anyway, if you guys have follow-up questions on this, feel free to let me know. Happy to answer anything else.

And uh I I can't stress enough like whether you agree or disagree on the whole like 20 to 50k a month is what top closers want to get paid.
