29. How to Identify and Fix Bottlenecks in Your Funnels to Maximize Conversions 5-31-25.mp4 But okay, so one thing that's going to come up again and again and again throughout your marketing career is going to be bottlenecks, okay, choke points. Contractions, something inevitably goes wrong, and there's a very specific reason that it goes wrong. A very certain step within your process is contracted, and if you find that step and you double that step or sometimes reduce it in half, you, as a result of that, have a ton of leverage to be able to double the quantity of people that convert out the other side, double the ROAS, double the revenue, etc. So it's a really simple way to think, yet a majority of people do not actually think. Like this, and a very consistent theme that happens in this group especially is you guys will do things like jump on one-on-one calls with me, shoot me DMs. Sometimes you've been asked questions like this in the group chat, where you're essentially just asking about something that you failed to identify as a bottleneck, or in certain instances, you've identified multiple things as choke points, and you might not necessarily be equipped for where to put your attention. Again, it's a super simple process; it's by no means nothing to overcomplicate, and we're going to go through how that process works here today. Also, if there's Anybody on the call that has any contraction what's within their current process, you know, I'd love to go through that and we'll use it as an example here later on. So, without further ado, let's just first of all lay down the concept structurally, get on the same page with how all this works, and then we'll go back and, like I said, we'll use an example together. So, first things first, what is a bottleneck? Okay, a bottleneck is a choke point within your statistics that causes your revenue to come out the other side at a lower amount. Right, I usually look at this kind of like if you had a hose as an example and you had like one of those little Kinks in the hose, what it does is it makes all the water that's otherwise going to flow through this choke up right here, and so you end up getting like a really thick, like super fucking backed up hose, and only like a little bit of water comes out the other side. That's the same kind of concept here with how we're looking at our advertising and our you know just our overall steps in the process. So, as an example of some of these steps, if we're running paid ads, as an example, one of the first things that we have that we can identify are CPMs, right? What's our cost to just reach a thousand people? Sometimes it could be the literal first step. Within the process that ends up being contracted, and that's obviously very problematic. We have from there our link click-through rate. Okay, now I want to be very direct when I say this. Each one of these statistics in most instances has like a set of sub-statistics that make it up. Okay, and these sub-statistics you don't necessarily need to pay attention to each one of those individually unless you've identified that the main statistic is choked out. At that point, it makes sense to drill down independently into each one of those sub-statistics. So as an example of that, like link click-through rate, you could argue. Is made up of statistics like the thumb stop percentage, which is the total quantity of people that see an ad versus stop and actually like pay attention to whatever the ad is. The higher that is, obviously the better. We have our video engagement statistics in general on our ad creatives that we can look at, and we can drop our performance and clicks down. I'm sorry, we can drop our columns down. Instead of looking at like performance and clicks as our default view, we can look at something like video engagement, and we can see our drop-off percentage. If I have a significant drop-off percentage and I get very few people that actually. Are attentive throughout the rest of the video. That's bad, you know. More ideally, I'm always going to see a pretty significant drop at the beginning, but I want to see a more, you know, like a stronger retention curve towards the end. Again, these statistics, they don't mean anything unless our link click-through rate is choked out. Okay, so I want to be clear, like some of you guys, especially the more analytical amongst you, you are so analytical and so over the top with what you choose to track. I think it's fucking retarded. Like, I would never do what some of you do with how intense you track each individual statistic. Again, it's negligible. To have to track all of those smaller things until they all of a sudden matter because the bigger thing is choked out. Okay, very important to differentiate what is a big statistic versus what is a small statistic because the small statistics are distractions. Essentially, they're super easy ways to get caught up and think that attention needs to go to a particular place when in reality it doesn't. Okay, so anyway back to my point. We have CPMs, we have our link click-through rate, and then obviously from here we have all kinds of funnels that we're going to drive the traffic to. So let's use in this example that we're driving. Traffic to something like a call funnel or a webinar. Let's use an example of both. So the first step within a webinar process is our opt-in percentage. So how many people are hitting the page versus how many people are converting into people who are officially going to show up for that said webinar. Now, from here we have a few other things like show rate. Now again, in terms of sub-statistics, it's like there's a lot of stuff that I can determine with each one of just those two stats right there that don't necessarily matter until those specific steps become my choke point, until they become my bottleneck. So, like on opt-in rate, if I have a VSL on the page as an example, the play rate of the VSL, the retention curve of the VSL, if I have tools like Hotjar or whatever your preferred DVR-based tool is to be able to watch recordings of what people do on your website. Again, the statistics of that don't necessarily mean anything until that specific statistic is choked out. Show rate can be made up of things like open rates for our emails, click-through rates, just email deliverability in general, our SMS deliverability, you know, things like this. In addition to that, it can be made up of like, do we have our confirmation page videos on the page? Do we have our hammer them sequences? What's the frequency of our hammer them sequences? None of those things matter until all of a sudden our show rate's contracted. Okay, so from here I would also argue that a main statistic can sometimes give or take the funnel be argumentative. Okay, so as an example, during a webinar, I'm going to quiz you guys real quick; throw your answer into the chat. Do you think that the quantity of people who were there live during the pitch counts as a major statistic in a webinar? So it's like you got the show rate, which is the quantity of people who were there during peak attendance, let's say. Okay, but then you got the quantity of people that were there during your pitch. Does that technically count as a sub-statistic, or does it count as a main statistic? Right, the quantity of people that were there during your pitch. Okay, because I would argue that it's a main statistic. I would definitely say, hey, this makes a lot of sense to track and quantify because if I get a thousand people that show up, and you know, that's like my peak attendance rate, but they weren't there during the pitch, and I only had 300 people during the pitch, that goes to show that the bottleneck is how fucking terrible your webinar is in that example and how, how awful you are at presenting to get that low of a quantity of people to stick by the time you're actually making your pitch. Okay, so we can call that a bunch of things, but if we call it like retention rate, you can also call this again just like attendance during your pitch. Okay, main statistics, okay, main statistics are what we want to track when we're doing bottleneck analysis. Although yes, there are sub-statistics, they don't matter until they matter. Okay, so now let's use the example that I'm not doing direct to checkout. Let's say that I'm people, I want them to go book a call Okay, so from there I have my booking rate, quantity of people that hear my pitch, and then choose to book a call as a result of hearing the pitch. Okay, from here we have our assuming that we have a one-call close because again, you shouldn't have a two-call close when you're doing a webinar process. The webinar should act as the first call, and the closing should happen on the first call that happens. So, long story short, we have our show rate to the call, and then from here we have a few other statistics like our close rate, and then we have our AOV. Okay, how much are we actually cash collected on average So for a webinar, like I said many times over, and I'll say it again, we have a bunch of sub-statistics within these stats that we can absolutely track, but we don't want to have deviate our attention until they all of a sudden are the specific choke point, and those stats now have a lot of leverage in them. The main stat is where we want to keep our attention Okay, so just to give you some perspective, let's just go through and let's list these off a little simpler, and let's put some statistics to it. Let's do a little quiz on which one of these in some math examples might be a choke point and where we should put our attention as a result. Let's see mathematically with which one to put your attention. So we have our attendance during pitch booking rate, show rate to the call. By the way, it's a great exercise to do with your marketers if you have a marketing staff. Okay, so we're going to go through, we're going to list some statistics. All right, now I also want to be clear before we continue on to this. Real quick, this is like a side note for you to have awareness about which statistic could be bottlenecked. What must you be aware of? You must be aware of some general industry benchmarks for specific conversion mechanisms. Okay, you have to be generally aware of different KPIs, their ranges. Also know that you have to ideally pull stuff from similar niches to you, okay? Because every niche has varying statistics. As an example, I'm sitting down at Tai Lopez's house the other day, and I'm in a meeting with him talking about call funnels, and I'm over here hard flexing like a $1. 700 cost per call on a funnel that's operating at scale and Tai tells me he's got 600 salespeople with like a $12 cost per call. He's like, dude, I'm getting four to twelve dollar cost per call. This motherfucker opens his laptop and just pulls it out and shows me and I'm like, okay, that's pretty crazy. Can you show me the funnel? And then you go look at the funnel and it doesn't have an application, it didn't even have any questions in the scheduler, it just had a super ambiguous like book your call type call to action with very little friction. And I mean, keep in mind the guy had fucking 600 salespeople to just book calls into. It's like you'd probably reduce the friction too if you had that many sales reps that you needed to fill the capacity for. But it's like at the end of the day when you hear somebody like Tai getting a four to twelve dollar cost per call and you just think to yourself, oh my god, like my cost per call is like fucking five hundred dollars but it's like you're Selling something that costs fifty thousand dollars and Tai's selling something that might cost fifteen hundred dollars, in that example, that statistic has no relevance as a KPI to you. You see what I'm saying? It's like, so when Tai's telling me he has a four to twelve dollar cost per call, I don't give a fuck. It's like somebody, you know, telling me that, hey, like, you know, I've got this and that going on. It doesn't mean anything, you know? It doesn't mean anything to me at all because it has no relevance to what I'm doing. It has no similarities. There's truly no examples there where those overlap each other. Timothy asked. In the chat, what would be the advantage of what Tai's doing? Obviously, he's a smart dude, but to have 600 sales reps and those qualifiers sounds like a nightmare. There must be something I'm missing. Well, yeah, Tai just operates at scale, so in your niche, you don't operate at scale. You don't have enough sales reps to operate at scale. You don't have enough sales reps to reduce friction. You don't have enough volume and demand in order to do what Tai does, so therefore, you don't get to do what Tai does. You have to do what you do in comparison, so anyway, the point I'm trying to make is you have to understand sometimes you're going to hear Some statistics, and you're going to reflect on your statistics and be like, man, my stats fucking suck compared to those stats, or my stats are way better than that person's stats. Relevance matters a ton when you're doing benchmark analysis and you're just trying to see where you stack up comparatively to others. Like, there's some of you in this very group, in this very call right now, that have, you know, 300 to 500 cost per qualified calls, but as I mentioned, like, your AOV is like 30 plus thousand dollars or like 20 plus thousand dollars, and you're still operating at a tremendous profit for every sale that you do. It's like that. Doesn't mean anything negative in that example for you, like you're good in comparison. You know, like I said, when somebody like Tai is operating with a four to twelve dollar cost per call, you could imagine his other statistics probably aren't that good, like his show rate's probably not that good, his close rate's probably not that good, his AOV is probably not that good. But again, he's operating at a scale where even if he's chipping a thousand dollars per sale and selling thousands of people in a month, you know, it ends up playing out pretty well. So anyway, I'm going to show you some random statistics as it relates to all of these. Here, and we're just going to do a little bottleneck analysis, okay? And what we're going to attempt to do is we're just going to attempt to see which one of these statistics is contracted and which one would be easiest to double or easiest to reduce in half. And we're gonna try to see the mathematical differences as a result of that. So let's get started. Let's say that we have a $43 CPM. Let's say our link click-through rate is 1. 02%. Let's say our opt-in rate is sitting at 14%. Let's say our show rate to the webinar is sitting at 19%. Let's say our attendance during the pitch is at 81%, meaning out of everybody that showed up, 81% of people were there during the pitch. Let's say our total booking rate was sitting at 11%. Let's say our show rate to the call is 70%. Let's say our close rate is 22%. And let's say our AOV, we're all gonna make up a price here that we collectively agree. We're gonna say that our total price is $10,000 and we're gonna say our AOV is $7,000, okay? So these are our statistics. Which statistic, when you track these, would you choose to pay attention to? Which statistic deserves your attention and seems like it has the most leverage, okay? Whenever I talk about bottleneck analysis, one thing that I want to make really clear is we are attempting to double the revenue as a result of doubling a key statistic or reducing a key statistic in half. I always use this example where I tell people, I'm like, you need to think like a doctor, okay? For any of you who have ever been to the doctor, which I know we got a room full of men here for the most part, there are a lot of you who probably don't go to the doctor that often. But when you go to the doctor, when you've had the opportunity to go to the doctor, what they do when you present them with a set of symptoms is they gather the data first, okay? AKA, they get all your symptoms and they listen to what you're saying And they just kind of stack them all together first. And they're just like, all right, so this is the data that we're working with. Then what they do is they think in bets, okay? In their words, they think in probabilities. So what they start to do is they start to simply, okay, out of all these things that I'm looking at, which one is it most probable to be? Which one is it most probable to be? And from there, they also rank by severity, okay? I'm probably gonna severely misspell this word, but whatever. They rank it by severity, okay? So simply put, like as an example, the first time I ever had a migraine in my life, I had no idea what the fuck was going on, dude. I had like swirls in my vision. You know, my hand was like going a little numb. I was trying to say I have a headache out loud, but I kept saying I have a haircut. Like, I just thought I was stroking out, dude. I had no idea what the fuck was going on. So I ended up calling an ambulance. And by the time the ambulance showed up, every single symptom had receded. It was just gone. Like, I was just totally back to normal again. But obviously, not knowing what happened, I chose to go to the hospital. As I showed up to the hospital, I explained my symptoms. And I was like, yeah, so I was fucking not able to see properly. Like, I had a really sharp headache, like right in the center of my head. Like, it felt like such a pinpoint headache. I was sensitive to light, you know? I had this numbness. And they were like, wow, like, you know, those kind of sound like stroke symptoms. So there were three things they had essentially bet. They were like, all right, could be a stroke, could be this thing called a TIA, which is like a random fleck of plaque that gets stuck in a vein in your brain that causes some of those same symptoms. Or they were like, oh, could it be a migraine, you know? Due to the fact that it sounds like it was a migraine, but you know, severity of the fact it could have been a stroke, and that's way worse, we're gonna treat it like it might've been a stroke. So let's go ahead and run some tests relative to that. So they start doing tests. We go and we get a CAT scan, we get an MRI. You know, they obviously just monitor me for like a couple hours. And eventually a neurologist comes in and he was like, yeah dude, you just had a migraine, you know? And I'm like, what the fuck is that, you know? Anyway, that's a different story. Point is though, this was how doctors think, okay? They think in bets, they rank by severity, they run some tests, okay, to potentially accumulate additional data. And then from there, they are essentially doubling down on whatever they think it is. And that's where they're gonna put most of their attention. So if you right now look at these statistics: $43 CPM, a 1. 02% link click-through rate, a 14% opt-in rate, a 19% show rate, an 81% attendance during the pitch, an 11% booking rate, a 70% show rate to the call that was scheduled, 22% of those people close in a $7,000 AOV on a $10,000 product. Okay, which statistic would you specifically be attentive to that seems easiest to double or easiest to reduce in half if appropriate? Okay, so Trey says very confidently, immediately link click-through rate and close rate are immediate needle movers. Okay, now although yes, there might be two statistics that you choose to identify, you've gotta follow the best practice of thinking in bets. Okay, so you only get to focus on one. This is the power of how testing works within our process. If we have two statistics that we split our attention between, we might not actually get the opportunity to fix either statistic because we're splitting our attention If one of them ends up working, then to be clear, we might not know which one ended up actually working because we did two things at once. We wanna have a set of constants and variables, guys. And the variable that we're gonna choose to test needs to be one of these statistics individually. Again, the concept of bottleneck analysis is by opening up one of these statistics, okay, just one of the statistics that gives us insane leverage to double our revenue, double our ROAS, and just get more out of essentially spending the same amount. Okay, Stamar says link click-through rate and opt-in. Timothy initially says opt-in percentage and link click-through rate and changes his answer to just opt-in. Trey also says webinar close rate being 22% is trash. Well, to be clear, that is the close rate of people who showed up to a call. And to be clear, if you chose to apply bottleneck analysis to it and think, okay, could I double that from 22 to 44, go ahead and everybody answer in the chat real quick. 44% close rates, does that sound that out of all these, right? If I took as an example, a link click-through rate and I got it to 2. 04%, does that sound the most realistic? If I took an opt-in rate from 14% to 28% on a free webinar, does that sound most realistic? If I took my show rate from 19% to 38%, does that sound most realistic? If I took my attendance during the pitch from 81% to even higher than that, does that sound realistic? If I took my booking rate from 11% to 22%, if I took my show rate to the call and somehow got it from 70% to like 90, or if I took my close rate from 22 to 44, you see what I'm saying? So the point I'm trying to make is, is Trey over here saying, well, it all sounds realistic. Okay, and that's retarded to think, Trey. That's retarded to think because no, they do not in any way, shape or form all sound realistic. You must be oblivious to industry benchmarks and KPIs. Because, as an example, show rate to a call, it's like, dude, to go from 70% and act like you're gonna double that up to 90%, it's like, well, that makes no sense to pay attention to. That's already pretty good, okay? So let's look at it like this. Out of all of these options that we have, let's just be clear on which ones have the leverage to double, okay? So could we double this link click-through rate to 2%? Sure, yeah, we could. Could we double this to 28%? Absolutely, we could, for sure. Could we double this show rate to the actual webinar to 38%? Eh, probably not. Go ahead, anybody in the chat running a webinar right now, go ahead and drop your show rate to your webinar currently. Anybody who's running a webinar or has run a webinar recently, even what you think a show rate should be for a webinar, drop your show rate in the chat. And let's see some show rate percentages. So we got 22%, 33%, 50%. Sanjay makes sure to emphasize that his statistic is warm and cold. Stamar says 15 to 17%, you see? And to be clear, this is really important to understand, right? Could we get that up to a 38%? Yeah, I mean, listen, we definitely could. We definitely could, but it's kind of one of those like, well, it depends, right? And what does it depend on? Somebody tell me in the chat, what does that depend on? What is nobody qualified when they look at that show rate? What's nobody asked the question of? The type of traffic, bingo. So it's like, all right, what if the answer was this whole webinar that we're talking about here is strictly to cold traffic? What's the show rates looking like now? Does it seem easiest to double now versus if I told you, all right, all the traffic comes from organic? These are people who already follow you. These are people who you've promoted to without paid spend. You see? So it's like where the statistic is realistic to double also comes down to what type of traffic is going through it in the first place, right? So if it's cold traffic in this example, it's like, yeah, I mean, we're probably not gonna double. However, if it's warm traffic or organic traffic, there's a really high probability that not only we could double it, we might even be able to get it higher than that. Okay? So again, keep that in mind. Now the attendance during the pitch is like at 81%, like, look, we're not getting that to fucking 162%. And is there a lot of leverage in only kicking that statistic up like 10%? Probably not, but that's what we have financial modeling for. We could go into a financial model with each one of these statistics, and we could also see for ourselves what a 10% lift in that statistic might do. So again, is this the statistic that's easiest to double? Probably not. Okay? All right, now the booking rate. The booking rate only being at 11%. Again, for the people who don't know yet or who joined in late, the booking rate in this case represents the quantity of people that are going to book a call for those that were there during the pitch. At 11%, I'd argue that's very low. We've typically seen as an example of a benchmark upwards of 30% of people booking calls. So could we double that? Absolutely. Okay? Now, as I'm going through this and I just look at these statistics, I also kind of want to think to myself, okay, I'm also attempting to rank by severity. Okay? I'm trying to rank by severity. What does that necessarily mean when you look at these statistics? Okay? Which one seems like the easiest? Which one out of all of these is the literal easiest? Okay? That's also what we want to be thinking with. All right, now show rate to a call being 70%. Could we get that higher? I mean, you know, I guess, you know, but it's like, is that the easiest? Probably not. Now our close rate going from 22% to 44%. Believe it or not, I mean, technically, yeah, we could do that. But again, is it the easiest? Hmm, probably not. Okay, we got a $7,000 AOV. Anybody that's done math, you'll know that in terms of severity, if I get an extra thousand bucks out of every buyer, that can be pretty significant for what it does. Okay? Is that necessarily the easiest? No, we don't know. Do we have funding options? Why are people coming through and only paying $7,000 instead of $10,000? Could it be as simple as you're pitching a payment plan in the webinar itself, and you need to stop doing that? Could it be that you're pitching funding, and you need to leave that for the salespeople to talk about? Again, there are a lot of reasons that that could be like a questionable thing. Okay, now when we look at all these, and again, I want you guys to answer one more time, which one of these now seems easiest to double? I want you to have a single answer out of all these different statistics that we see. What is considered the easiest of them all? Okay, and let's also be clear on this. Let's assume that it's a cold traffic webinar. Okay, let's all get on the same page from that perspective as well and say that it's a cold traffic webinar. People who have no idea who you are, you've excluded your warm traffic completely, and you are attempting to convert ice cold traffic. I see three answers so far. I'll give you guys a moment if you're taking a moment to think about it. Again, what is the easiest statistic here to double out of all these stats that you see? A majority of you so far, four of you say link click-through rate, two say link click-through rate, four say opt-in. Okay, so for those that say link click-through rate, Chris, Trey, Louis, one at a time. Louis, unmute yourself. Tell me what an industry standard, what is the best link click-through rate you think exists? Give me an idea of what a benchmark for a link click-through rate should be. The best I think is like 3% to 4% and 2% to 2. 5% is doable. Do you run paid traffic right now, Louis? Yes. What's your average link click-through rate? 2. 4%. Very good. Okay, Chris, unmute yourself. What's a good link click-through rate? I can't say that I'm paying attention to this enough, Jeremy, so I'm embarrassed with that. Just the industry in general, Chris. What's a good link click-through rate? That's what you answered with, so obviously you've got to have the confidence to answer with it. What's your reasoning? My reasoning is that that's highest in the funnel, and it's going to be focused on the creative and just changing what it is that we're presenting and how we're presenting it. So that would, to me, I would think that 1% isn't necessarily low, but that it would be the highest leverage point that I would want to focus on. And in this example, would you be doing video ads or image ads most commonly? I would think video ads, for sure. Okay. And when you think of what's easiest, are video ads the easiest thing for you to create? I wouldn't say that they're easiest, but if I'm already making them, it might be easiest to make improvements to it, is how I was seeing it. But I'm definitely going to defer to your implied feedback there. No, no, just asking, trying to understand your reasoning I would think, I mean, if we're already producing videos, then what are we doing that's not great? And we definitely had that experience starting with this program, working with you, Jeremy, because we were doing image ads and we switched to video ads and the results were dramatically better. And then we stopped producing the video ads ourselves and started working with Jay. And that also dramatically improves things. So that's just kind of from where we are. The sophistication level just isn't very high at that point in the funnel. Very good. Trey, unmute yourself. Why is it link click-through rate? What's the industry statistic for link click-through rate? I don't know industry statistic as well as you would, honestly. But whenever I do a video ad, I don't know, 2. 5 to 3. My video ads are 2. 5, like pretty consistent. So that's why I look at that as an immediate needle mover. Very good. Makes sense. Okay. And then for the people who answered with opt-in, Sanjay, unmute yourself. Why is opt-in the highest leverage statistic in your opinion? Just because it's, I think it's usually easier just to test new headlines, subheadlines, and packaging of the webinar than to do a whole new batch of ads. And also, if you just get the click-through rate up on an ad by doing like a spammy hook, it could, in theory, throw off like the quality of traffic that's landing on that page, if that makes sense. Yeah, it does. Very good. Timothy, why is it opt-in? I would agree with Sanjay's logic, right? Like to go and film a whole new batch of video ads, get them edited, cutesy the videos, like that's a longer cycle than just like split testing a headline on an opt-in page. And I think like one to three percent, I know that's a pretty big range, but you know, right now my click-through rate is like one percent, and our metrics are still solid. So I would say like the opt-in rate, especially for a webinar, I think you can get a higher rate. Very good. Thank you for your opinion. Reece, why is it opt-in? Yeah, I'm the same as the boys above, and then I haven't personally run one, but I've heard you can crank like 40% opt-in rates for people, so that seems like a pretty easy one to get up. Nice. Stamar, why is it opt-in rate? Oops, sorry, it's a little loud over here, but opt-in quickest to test compared to shooting new ads and really just the speed to testing it. Now what I tried to demonstrate to you here by allowing you all to contribute your opinions on which statistic it is and why, is notice how much variance there is in each one of your reasons for why you've concluded to the specific statistic that you've picked as the bottleneck. Okay? Some of you, it's the bias of what you've heard the statistic could be. Some of you, it's the bias of your own data, like Trey is an example. He's so sold that he knows that link click-through rates dog shit because he typically operates at a 2. 5%. Meanwhile, Timothy's over here like, well, I've historically averaged 1% and I'm ripping on returns right now. It's like, that doesn't seem easiest to double. I haven't seen 2% in my fucking career, you know? And then others are like, well, my opt-in rate is the highest and easiest to double there because dude, a 14% opt-in rate's boo-boo, you know? I can get that way up, you see? So here's the thing, right? This is very important to understand, okay? The bottleneck is personal, okay? You have to weigh your own biases against what you believe is easiest to influence. The only thing that is true, okay? What is universally true? It's math, okay? Math is universally true. So if I go in here, and again, I have a financial model built out for each one of these specific statistics, okay? And I just fuck around with each one of the statistics, and I'm going through and I'm doubling each one, and then I just ask myself, all right, link click-through rate seems like there's definitely some leverage there. The opt-in rate, completely agree with all of you. You're both technically right. Link click-through rate and the opt-in rate are for sure easiest to double there. Is the show rate the easiest to double? Eh, I mean, probably not. Probably not the easiest, okay? Is the booking rate easiest to double? Now, I'll tell you this. I'm quite surprised to see that nobody said the booking rate, okay? I'm quite surprised. The RE specifically said, if the pitch is extremely strong and high value and builds intent, I'd focus on the booking rate. So listen, RE, to be fair, was the only person who said booking rate, okay? Now, RE, unmute yourself. Why do you believe it's the booking rate? Like, why are you convicted that's the stat? Well, I think you brought up an earlier point that just makes sense. It's like mathematically, like it's the poorest. You know, if you want to look at it from like a number standpoint, you have the largest room for growth on that number. Like 11% is, it's actually horrendous. If you make enough of a strong pitch and guarantee they're already there, you could definitely jack that number up. You just have to make the offer more tempting because that just tells me it's not a good offer when you're pitching at 11% and you're only getting 11% booking rates. Yeah, and I would even add to that. I'd say, dude, you're pitching people to book a fucking call. Like, you're not even telling them to buy anything. You're telling them to book a call. You're telling me you can only get 11% of people to book a free call? Yeah. You know, it's like, how fucking terrible is that? So I completely agree. So my point is, is I also want to be clear. I have led you all on to think with doubling the statistic. Okay, personally, when I look at the booking rate, I think that should be triple what it is. I think to myself that should be in the 30s. That should be in the 30s, undoubtedly. It's a free call. I'm telling people to book a fucking call, okay? So I think to myself when I look at these statistics, I'm like, yeah, link click-through rate for sure, opt-in rate for sure. The booking rate goes like ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, like that seems like the highest probability to me. Because if I don't change literally anything else, that's the logic of bottlenecks. If I don't change a fucking thing else besides that one specific thing that's choked out, I'm gonna get double the return on the other side. So like, as an example of the booking rate, if I get that to a measly 22%, I'm gonna double the quantity of calls. I'm gonna double the quantity of people that show up to the calls. I'm gonna double the quantity of people that close. I'm gonna double the quantity of cash collected, okay? And therefore, I'm gonna double the ROAS without spending anything else. And it's the same thing for every other statistic. If I double my link click-through rate, I'm gonna do the same thing. I'm gonna double the quantity of people that opt in. I'm gonna double the quantity of people that show up. I'm gonna double the quantity of people that were there during the pitch. I'm gonna double the quantity of people that book, that show up to the call, that closed. You know, you see what I mean? So it's like point is, okay, the bottleneck is personal. And you wanna make sure that you're not just thinking through biases based on like what you personally are gonna project onto it, okay? I like to leverage, this group is a great example of that. Like very rarely do I see you guys go into the group chat and just do something as simple as asking, like, hey guys, here's my statistics. And literally just fucking paste your statistics in here like this. Like paste your stats into the group and be like, which one do you guys think is bottlenecked? And you can see just from being here live, there's a handful of different answers that you get, but a majority bias towards two: link click-through rate and opt-in percentage. Meanwhile, Ari will give you the perspective or I would give you the perspective too. I'd be like, dude, your booking rate sucks ass, okay? So anyway, my point is, I'm gonna use, Stamar, can you give me permission real quick? Is it okay if I use you as an example just based on what we had talked about yesterday? Yep. Okay, so Stamar gets on a one-on-one call with me and he says, hey, like I'm thinking about all these things that I gotta do. Like I'm considering bringing in a marketer. I really need to focus on like some fulfillment stuff and like. At the same time though, my webinar needs some improvement and I think the sales team specifically is fucking up and he's just all over the place, dude. There's just a lot of different things that he could choose to focus on. I want to be clear when I say this. When you guys get in those positions, literally all you need to do is bottleneck analysis. Bottleneck analysis determines where you put attention There's nothing else you need to do. You need to just ask yourself through doing math, okay, where should I put my attention? Where is my highest probability to get the most leverage out of putting my attention somewhere right now? As an example, he had a close rate on his webinar of like 10%. It's like when you guys hear that statistic, I'm sure you guys all collectively agree like, yeah, that could be improved for sure. But then when you look at something like his booking rate or you look at some of the feedback that he was getting based on what the closers were saying happens on the calls or what he's hearing in the recordings of those calls, there was also a lot of improvement that could be made inside of his webinar and that could improve his booking rate and it could improve his close rate at the same time. So sometimes, like back to my migraine story, okay, they were able to run two tests that technically were able to check a box for whether it was or wasn't something at the same time. When they did a CAT scan and an MRI, they were able to do at the exact same time the testing that was necessary to see if it was a stroke or a TIA and it was neither. And then they were like, all right, now that it's not that, it's just a migraine, okay? So sometimes we can run a test, like as an example, if we do focus on the booking rate out of all these statistics, could we logically improve our close rate too? Could we logically improve our AOV too? And to some of your points, when I asked you, okay, well, why did you say opt-in rate instead of link click-through rate? There were two of you had the same reason. You had said, well, if I try to just artificially jack up my link click-through rate, I might get a bunch of dog shit traffic through. And then unfortunately, you're obviously going to see a bunch of suffering across all these other statistics at the same time So all these statistics are also interconnected with one another. Each statistic, when we choose to put our attention in the right place, can influence all of the statistics that follow it, okay? So as an example, if I do take my attention and I put it specifically on the link click-through rate, every single statistic that follows is impacted by that specific test I run, okay? In comparison, if I put my attention on the booking rate, every single statistic that follows is impacted by it, you see? So in this example, the other thing that I want to be clear about is, this is more of an advanced bottleneck analysis perspective. I mean, listen, you guys who answered the way you did about the link click-through rate impacting everything else, I know, look, I feel your trauma, okay? You've had this happen before, where you've made a test at the top of the funnel process, and it's absolutely messed you all the way through. And you're not wrong to think like that, right? So it's like, you also got to consider that sometimes there's something we could do that, unfortunately, is really going to impact us negatively everywhere else. And so sometimes, although yes, we might be able to take our link click-through rate higher, right? We might be able to take our opt-in rate higher. Sometimes it just makes more sense to put attention further down the funnel solely to reduce risk, okay? Really think about that. So I'm also attempting to reduce risk. And I want to be more clear when I say this; I want to reduce like blowback risk, okay? That doesn't mean that I'm never going to pay attention to up here. I'm definitely going to pay attention to up there too. But those things, they have more impact on everything else as a result of paying attention up there, okay? So naturally, I'm going to kind of prioritize what part of the funnel I pay attention to first, just based on a risk mitigation perspective, okay? You see what I'm saying? Okay, so back to my point at hand, I want to be really direct when I say this, okay? Let's just summarize this to a degree. The things that make the most sense to be thinking with, okay, in kind of a combination, is what's easiest to double or reduce in half. An example of the reduce in half would be like, could I reduce my CPMs in half as an example? That makes sense to reduce in half. Everything else in that example makes sense to just double up, okay? I also wanna be thinking in severity, okay? What needs attention like right fucking now? You know, like what's the equivalent to a stroke? What's the equivalent to that TIA versus what has less severity and isn't gonna fuck me as hard if it's left unchanged, okay? And again, I also wanna be thinking with the risk. I wanna be thinking with that down the funnel risk, okay? All these things in combination ultimately then lead me to my attack mode, okay? Now this is the most important part. After we've done our bottleneck analysis, we must move into attack mode, okay? So attack mode is where we take all of our attention and we put it on that key area that's contracted. So in this example, if we wanted to put our attention on the booking rate, literally all of my attention is going to what makes up that statistic. So remember, back to the top of this whole thing, I had mentioned that each one of these statistics is made up of some sub-statistics. So when you guys hear me say, okay, we want to attack the booking rate, what sub-statistics make up the booking rate? Like what is the booking rate made up of? What determines the booking rate, okay? So again, if we assume that we wanted to attack the booking rate in this hypothetical example, okay? The actual webinar content is one thing, the pitch is another thing, okay? The offer, okay? Did I drop pricing or not? Did I drop like funding options? Did I make it easier, seem hard? You know, there's a bunch of stuff that like makes up this booking statistic, this total booking rate, okay? What else am I missing? Does anybody else see anything that I'm missing that makes sense to add to this? Louis, dude, that's a fucking banger for sure. The booking process, right? And what does that technically mean? That's like, well, did you have an application? How many questions were in that application, right? Did you have inconvenient call slots available, right? I thought it was really funny. I can't remember which one of you it was. One of you just the other day, you were selling to nine-to-fivers and all your call times were in between nine and five. And I was like, how the fuck? Like you had a bunch of applications, and you had nobody scheduling calls. And it's like, well, no shit, no shit. You're trying to have people book calls during work, man. You need to have call slots available before they go to work and after they get off work to get people to book in that example. See what I mean? Okay, Ari says the FAQ and objection handling. Yeah, for sure, for sure. Could definitely be made up of FAQ and the objections. I would also say we could add in here a nice repitch, okay? And also just how you pitch in general. So just the other day, we had a client. They were new to webinars. They were giving it a shot. And I taught him this Russell Brunson trick of the asking for permission to close. And so what Russell will do when he gets to the point of the pitch is he'll just ask. He'll be like, hey guys, in order to support you further from here, I do have an awesome opportunity. It's a paid offer. I don't just wanna be the guy to just start pitching you without your permission I would love the opportunity to get you guys this additional help that I think you need, that I think would be extremely beneficial for you. Can you just do me a favor? Can you drop a one in the chat if it's okay if I transition to pitching you guys on something that I think could benefit you a lot? Is that okay? Can you just give me permission? Can you drop a one in the chat if it's cool if I transition to a pitch? And then everybody will just drop a bunch of ones, and he'll just start immediately hard pitching the fuck out of them. Cause some of you guys do it really weird, like some of you guys, like you just try to like sly drop it in there. It's like, it's better to just ask, get the permission directly. That works so well. So like how you pitch, how long you pitch, how hard you pitch, you know, all these things obviously can be made up of the how you pitch section. Okay. So again, when you look at all these, all these things, right, this is a lot of stuff. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 different things here, man. That's a lot of stuff. That's a lot of stuff to pay attention to. And this is where most of you guys fuck up. You do bottleneck analysis. You don't realize how much stuff there is to focus on that makes up this one statistic. And so you become convinced that you can focus on more than one key statistic that you're trying to open up at the same time. When in reality, it's like, think about what you got to do to increase your booking rate. You probably need to watch some people's webinars, right? You probably need to do things like read our mastering webinars SOP and watch some of the examples in there. You probably need to clip out the section of your pitch and share it in the fucking group chat and say, Hey guys, I'm getting an 11% booking rate right now. Do you guys mind? Does anybody have five minutes? Can you just watch my pitch real quick? Try to look outside of your own webinar. Okay, in addition to that, you obviously need to watch it. So I love, I love looking at professional sports organizations for how they do what they do. They take it so fucking seriously. Okay. If you guys ever sit courtside at a basketball game and you're sitting near the bench, you'll realize that when you look at the bench, right? Like most of you guys, you see the players that are sitting on the bench itself, right? And then you'll see a few coaches that might be sitting right here. And what you don't realize is, is there's all these other coaches that sit right behind the bench. And there's also all of these staff that are like little trainers and you know, people that take care of the players, too. And there's a whole second row of people that sit behind the, the, the players and the, and the key coaches. Okay. And what's happening here is you are in real time. When you watch these people, they have laptops, like these guys right here. All these folks, they have laptops that are getting fed real time game footage. Okay. Real time game footage, you know, in college football, they started doing this. In the NFL, they started doing this. They walk around with iPads, and as soon as the players come off the field, they'll show them some things that they did really well, and they'll show them some things that they did terribly wrong. Okay. I had a great question for you guys. After you get done with your webinar, do you rewatch it as soon as you get off the field? Probably not. You probably go to bed or go celebrate, give or take how good your webinar did. Okay, you probably do not just immediately watch it. Why do you think that the NBA, that the NFL, that college football, why do you think, why do you think soccer superstars around the world? Why don't they wait until after the game to show them? Because they're going back into the game. They're still in the fucking game, so of course, they're going to show them right now. They have room for immediate improvement. You're not going back into the game right after you finish your webinar, but you've got time in between that webinar finishing and the next one to watch your footage. Be honest with yourself. Are you watching your webinars like game footage to see from a perspective? Imagine you watch your own webinars from a perspective of how could this have been improved. If I ask myself, how could I triple my booking rate? And I watch it that perspective, I bet you would pull a lot of data about what you could have done to improve. I bet you could. Okay, and that's my point is like this goes for all statistics. It's like, as an example, if I wanted to double my link click-through rate, I need to go watch my own ads. I need to go listen and watch other people's ads. I need to get another perspective. Okay, I need to the group. I remember one time, one of our, one of our more recent inner circle members, who's been in here for just shy of a year, I believe Ewan, Ewan was running a challenge funnel and his ROAS was like 0. 7. He shoots me over his page and his ads and he goes, what's wrong with these? Why do you think I'm at a 0. 7? He had the most random story that had nothing to do with what he sells and talks about. Some shit about TikTok on his sales page that was like an enormous section, and I was like, I just don't see the connection at all between this random TikTok story that you're using for a huge chunk of your sales page and your offer. Like, what is this about? So he reworks his sales page. The dude goes to a 3X ROAS within like that literal day from changing it. It was awesome. But my point is, is like, he couldn't see that himself. He needed that outside perspective. You guys all are a part of a group where you're not paying to be a coach, but like you're paying for that ability as well. So when somebody else asks like, hey, what do you guys think about this? It's like, just remember, you're essentially building good karma for the opportunity to leverage that same exact feedback when you need it. And this is what this kind of thing is all about. That's the whole point of being in a mastermind. A mastermind, by definition, is all of us collectively participating in one central brain that we all get to use. Okay, that's the whole fucking point. Okay, that's what a mastermind literally is. So anyway, I digress. My point is, is when you go into attack mode, okay? And in this case, you look at your booking rate, there's a lot of stuff to do to improve it. And therefore that lowers my probability dramatically that I can be attentive to all the other things too. So I wanna isolate my attention to what I'm attacking. Okay, I wanna put all my attention into that singular thing to try to double it up. Because all it takes is one webinar in this example to go from 11% to upwards of 33% if I triple that shit. You see, and what would that do for my revenue, dude? That'd be insane. That'd be insane. That would triple my calls. That would triple my revenue. That would triple my ROAS. You know, all within one statistic. One, this is the key, okay? One stat holds leverage. Okay? Yes, they all technically hold leverage But you don't get to be attentive to all of them at once. You get to be attentive to one at a time. Because that singular statistic, getting all of your attention, dramatically increases the probability that it actually doubles and that you get to milk the leverage from it. You understand? So I ask you this. When you look at your own statistics currently for whatever you're driving the traffic to, where is the bottleneck? Where is it? And which specific bottleneck, because sometimes there's more than one, which specific bottleneck are you gonna be the most attentive to and choose to attack next? Okay? Because when it comes to maximizing conversions through any funnel, no matter what type of funnel it is, it all comes down to this. Okay? It all comes down to this. It's like a game of whack-a-mole. Okay? There's rarely a time when all statistics are perfect and nothing is easiest to double or reduce in half. There's rarely a time when nothing's bottlenecked or choked out. A majority of the time, once you solve one bottleneck, okay, so let's say that I officially solved my booking rate. Right? That's done. I no longer need to be attentive to it. Well, guess what? I mean, dude, right away, it's like I can take my attention to the link click-through rate, the opt-in rate, right? I could take my attention to the AOV. You see what I'm saying? It's like whack-a-mole, right? And then eventually those ads that I got to get a higher link click-through rate, they're gonna fatigue. And then I'm gonna have to launch a new batch and then I might be in the same spot again where I might be slowly working my opt-in rate up. And then meanwhile, my booking rate starts to fall again because now I'm getting different people through. Now I need to adjust my webinar. So, it's what's important to understand, okay? This is a key question: the bottlenecks prevent scale, yes or no? Which one? If I have a bottleneck present, does it prevent me from scaling? I got a yep, a yes, a yes, a yes, a yes. Well, you guys, I mean, no shit, you're not scaling if that's your answer, OK? No shit, you're not scaling. Let's use Stamar. Stamar, unmute yourself. Tell the people the ROAS in your current fucked webinar. And the fucked webinar has a 2. 2, 2. 25. Ken, answer in the chat with a one if the answer is yes. Answer in the chat with a two if the answer is no. Can Stamar still scale? One, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one. Depends on his financials, is fair. So think about this. It's like the bottlenecks prevent scale. It's like, no, dude. No, bottlenecks don't prevent scale. They can. The answer is also technically yes. Like, yeah, they can technically prevent scale. It just depends where your ROAS is at. And it depends on your ability to be profitable while you still have the choke points and are still dealing with them. I'll give you a perfect example, right? If in all these statistics above, by the way, I'm always shocked that nobody says, when we're looking at these statistics, why did nobody ask what the ROAS was? Right, sometimes, and you guys can reflect on this. Sometimes, y'all will be messaging me some shit. You'll be asking me like, hey, I got like this, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, you know, all these stats. And then I just ask, I'm like, what the fuck? Well, what's the ROAS? Like, what's the return right now? And then you'll be like, oh, it's a four. You know, and I'm like, all right, great. Well, I mean, yeah, we could absolutely focus on whatever bottleneck we have, but you better be spending more fucking money while you're doing it. You know, there's no reason in that example not to be spending more money. If I'm at a two point, Stemar, are you profitable at a two point, whatever you said? Yes Okay, so again, if he's profitable at whatever you just said, at a two point, whatever, and he's still got bottlenecks, does that prevent scale? Fuck no. It's a hard fuck no. Okay, he could still spend more money and make more money. Okay, but that's the thing. That's what usually prevents people from scaling up. They have a bottleneck and they think to themselves, man, I'm not gonna be able to push this thing higher than it is now. Okay? I got this piece of shit Ferrari that I have as a company car for one of my staff members. It's called a Ferrari FF. It's got a V12 in it and it's a four seater Ferrari. It's got a back seat and it's crazy. I tuned it. I spent probably $50,000. So this one actually looks pretty similar to mine. And one of my staff members, Jay, he moved down from Washington to Miami here. And naturally, when you move down to Miami, you gotta have a Ferrari. I mean, what else you gotta have? I don't know. So I give him this as a company car because I fucking hate this car. I spent like 50 plus thousand dollars and it was gone for seven months fixing the transmission and some electrical shit going on with it. Now, here's the thing. This car, still when I got it back, had random issues with it because it had a new transmission Anybody who's ever gotten a new car knows you can't drive it aggressively until you break it in. There are rev limiters on certain cars until the engine has a certain amount of miles on it, or in this case, until the transmission has a certain amount of miles on it. And so as soon as I got it back, like realizing I couldn't drive it like how I would drive a Ferrari, like I said, it became a company car. We gave it to a staff member. Now, right away, there are all kinds of random little issues that are wrong with this vehicle, like the head unit, the little radio thing. That was an aftermarket one that some person who owned it prior to me put into that thing, and it was causing a battery draw So we just unplugged it. Didn't even have a radio. Just, you don't need a radio when you got a V12. Tell you that right now. That's music to your ears by itself. But I digress. It's a problem nonetheless. Here's the thing though. As problematic as this is, okay, it still was an absolutely fucking sick car. Okay, my staff, as soon as he got it, I mean, he drove this thing fast as fuck. He would drive it like how I would normally drive it because to him, it's like, it didn't have all the problems because it was new to him. But because I had experienced at its peak, you know, I had known about all the little problems. He didn't give a shit. He just had a Ferrari. Here's the point I'm trying to make, okay? There's stuff wrong with the car. Does that prevent you from driving the car? No. Does that prevent you from driving the car fast and enjoying the car? No. But to somebody else like you, right? Like just like in that scenario with me, I was not driving the car fast. I was not driving the car like a Ferrari. I knew about all the problems with it, and therefore I wasn't exploiting it to its fullest potential, right? My staff member, Jay, he didn't know any of those things. He just thought this is fucking awesome. This is a V12 Ferrari I'm gonna fucking rip this thing around Miami and have a ball. And he did, and he does, okay? So to one person, the vehicle can be fucked, okay? To another person, the vehicle is drivable and ready to rip around, okay? So to all of you who said, do bottlenecks prevent scale and you answered with yes, I mean, what? Like think about that, right? It's like, you're like me with the Ferrari versus you need to have the mentality of the staff member in the Ferrari instead. Like you still need to push up. You know, you still need to push up. You still need to gas it. You can fix stuff along the way. Bottlenecks do not prevent scale unless you're not profitable. If you're not profitable, obviously you have to address them before you scale. So it makes sense. Do me a favor, drop a one in the chat if you're picking up what I'm putting down. Unmute yourself if you got questions or drop your questions in the chat. Let's wrap it up. Anybody got questions on this? I do. Great training, Jeremy, appreciate this. One of the biggest things I feel like I'm struggling with is like doing the bottleneck analysis, which makes perfect sense. But like the part I'm struggling with is having a way where all of those numbers are just consistently up to date and like compiled in one spot that's easy to look at. What is the best way that you go about having those numbers like always accurate? Because I feel like a lot of times when I go to do the bottleneck analysis, I spend my time trying to find the numbers and making sure they're accurate instead of just looking at them and making decisions. It depends on how much money you make for what kind of solution you can implement. I just have a staff member that's like a reporting staff member and their whole job is just to do that. Just literally every day they just go through and they just sweep every analytic and they just update it. And then we have the ability to look at it in real time. There's really no other way to do it because it's a lot of manual statistics. It's like there's no third-party tool like HiROS or something that tracks all those independent statistics in one place. Usually, they're pretty spread out, and they have to be centralized. The other solution is, and there's a lot of like custom stuff you could do. We have a weekly inner circle group call from a girl named Amber who's in the inner circle. You can tag her with questions on things like this too. She builds out custom dashboards that typically update in real time, and they use Google Looker Studio and Zapier, and like all the APIs from all these different tools, and they just pull them all into essentially like a, like you can build Google Sheets as an example like this and have them functionally update every day. It just depends on your ability to like essentially build this centralized hub either autonomously or manually have it function that way. Does that make sense? It does, but it seems like the simplest way is just like have a VA that goes and updates it and just holding them accountable and the numbers consistent. Look, I'm all for exploiting third world labor to your point. It's one of my favorite things to do, and I completely agree that it's very efficient as well. I'm all for that, and to believe it or not, I mean, the statistics autonomously updating generally still have to be manually verified regardless, in order to ensure accuracy due to the impact that these statistics have on our decision-making. If the statistics are inaccurate, our decision-making will be inaccurate, and we will therefore not make the right choices and pay attention to the wrong things as a result of inaccurate data. And so, in most instances, whether autonomously or manually reported, they still have to be manually verified. Got it. Makes sense. And then let's say, for example, if I'm running a call funnel and then a webinar, you would obviously want to split those into separate bottleneck analyses. Of course, if you're doing like a book a call, like if the webinar is going to book a call, I guess I'm kind of getting lost in the weeds of how you would actually split that data out and track it. And then I kind of just like get to the. Well, the separation in funnels would give you separate data. So as an example, it's like I'm not going to use the same application in my call funnel that I would inside of my webinar. I would have two versions of that application created. So therefore, I have two different statistics to look at. Same thing with each individual thing. Everything in that example would just be independent to that funnel specifically. We also do that per traffic channel. So as an example, for a webinar, we have the paid version of the webinar. We have the organic version of the webinar. The paid version of the webinar, meaning it's just a URL that should never be used for anything other than that specific paid traffic channel. And then we have the organic version of the webinar that has like unique embeds on it as well for, again, making sure that all those statistics are unique to that traffic channel and therefore can be analyzed independently of each other. And it would be the same for the differences in funnels, obviously, with call funnels and webinars. OK, so you would just have like a separate calendar, a separate application, separate everything so you can split it out. Of course. OK, cool. Makes sense. Other questions? Feel free to unmute yourself and ask away. I got a question for you, dude. What's up, Trey? So, and this might be for another call. Let me know if it is because it's kind of a big topic. But how do you know that the issue in a funnel is structural to that funnel, rather like a mathematical issue like we talked about today, or if it's just an overarching issue with the angle? Does that make sense? The offer isn't there. The niche isn't there because I feel like sometimes I've gone on these rabbit trails of trying to make the math better, you know? And then I'm like, I don't even know if this is going to work. So do you have any frameworks and mentalities that you, or structure that you run things through to decide, like, you know what? This just isn't even viable? Does that question make sense? You generally find that out through testing. So it's like the doctor analogy when they ran the CAT scan and the MRI to see if it was a stroke or a TIA, and it wasn't literally the only thing left to conclude to was that it was a migraine. There wasn't any test or any data or any blood work or literally anything that indicated to them it was a migraine. That's just what they concluded it was because it wasn't a stroke or a TIA. You see? So generally, through testing, you can be more conclusive about things relating to, as an example, your offer just sucks, your messaging is way off, the niche just isn't there. You know, also there's generally a lot of macro data you can look at too. A good example of this is like Google Trends I remember one time we had a client; they were selling into a niche that, you know, nobody really knew was dying. However, it's like for a very long time, they were on the up and up, and then randomly they just started to contract. And it didn't matter what we did. Like, you know, this is a business that made great money for a very long time, and then all of a sudden it was just contracting. And no matter what we did, it just wasn't working. And then one day we went into Google Trends and we looked up that specific search term, and we saw that just on a macro level, there was a significant contraction in interest within the United States in that specific search term. And it made a lot of sense from that perspective. It was like, oh, well, I mean, simply put, like interest is contracting dramatically. And it seems like literally at the exact moment that this started to contract, the revenue started to contract and everything became harder. A good example of that is like Airbnb. I love using Airbnb as an example of that. So there was a period of time that you guys can all probably think of where Airbnb had nothing but like really positive feedback And like, there was a lot of social presence with Airbnb and like people saying all the cool things that they were doing with Airbnbs and like how they preferred it over hotels. And then think about how you most recently think of Airbnb. It's like Airbnb in the most recent couple of years has just been absolutely fucking trashed. You know, like all I've really seen is just a bunch of propaganda about cleaning fees and having to like do all kinds of crazy stuff that you wouldn't otherwise have to do in a hotel and crazy check-in and checkout times and like all these rules. You know, just a bunch of bad things, simply put, or like all the cameras. There was that whole period of time where it felt like a couple of months. Every other post was like somebody getting a fucking secret camera found in an Airbnb, you know? And the public perception changed dramatically to like, well, let's just go back to using hotels again. And it's like, well, imagine you had an Airbnb info offer during that period of time. Well, during the macro trend of it being widely accepted and like relatively new, you know? But versus now it's like, dude, there's entire cities that are outlawing Airbnb, you know? Like there's entire populations of people that fucking hate Airbnb now and have like strong opinions about it It's like, imagine what that would do to your revenue no matter what you attempted to try, you know? I've seen Airbnb ads most recently on TV when I've been watching sporting events where there's a completely different set of messaging, which has actually been really good. Like as an example, one of the messages that they've most recently ran has been, you wouldn't take like your family to a hotel and it shows like all your different family members in different rooms with walls in between them. And then the walls all collapse and they rebuild it into a house and it shows how much more enjoyable your vacation would be if you guys were all just in one big home. And it's like, dude, that was a great hook. You know, that was like a good unique example of who likely has a lot of appeal with Airbnb nowadays. So anyway, my point being macro trends can sometimes mess us you know, to your point. And no matter what we do from like a bottleneck perspective, we're not really gonna get any upside just due to things outside of our control. And you know, another good example of this right now is we have AI that is like, if you go on Google Trends and you type in like cold plunge. You add another search term, and you do like the past five years as an example, or you can do the all-time data if you'd like, isolated to the United States or whatever country you'd prefer. Do cold plunge, do red light, do methylene blue, and then do AI. And like, you'll see giant differences between like cold plunge and red light and methylene blue. And then when you add AI to it, it's like all those get dwarfed to literally nothing, but there's still multimillion dollar businesses that exist within those first three search terms. But then when you look at AI, like there's people amongst you right now inside of this very inner circle group that have gone from like a couple hundred K a month to a couple million dollars a month. And it's not been because of what they think they've done to get there. It's been because the macro trend has lifted them up to the heavens of multimillion dollar months. You see, has nothing to do with them. It has to do with the macro trend. So yes, that can absolutely play into your statistics. And I do want to be fair in saying though, we don't always want to defer to, especially in the first thought that that's the case. We'd much rather defer to this opinion of there's something we can do within our control, and we're gonna attempt to influence everything within our control first And then we are going to move to a perspective of, okay, well, something macro might be fucking me. Like, let me go look at that. Does that make sense? Makes a ton of sense, dude. So to clarify, it's your favorite tools, like things like Google Trends or things like AI, to kind of check for macro trends, check for mass consensus after running as many mathematical tests as you can at that point. Like, all right, there's just something in the way here that's just out of our control that we can't beat. Is that kind of what you're saying? Yeah, that's a good way to look at it, yes. Cool. Thanks, man. Really helpful. Great call. Of course, man. Does anybody else have questions? Feel free to unmute yourself and ask away. You can also drop your questions in the chat if you have anything. I got a quick question, if you don't mind. Cool. Yo. So kind of like to tack onto the last thing there. So we kind of started what was at the time an SMMA, and I think that's kind of a trend from say seven or eight years ago. I'm super interested in like the AI, and I know AI automations, agencies, whatever. That's kind of, you know, that's the trend at the moment. Do you think it would be pertinent to kind of move towards that at an expedited rate to kind of like catch that wave? Or what are your thoughts on that I'm not gonna say who, so I can be more particular, but one of our inner circle members teaches copywriting. And he was contracting in revenue for a good couple months in a row. And he came, and he had lunch with me here in Miami. And I told him, I was like, why? Like I looked at his content prior to him coming to the lunch, and I was like, why are you selling against AI? And he sold me on this position of, I just, I think that the skill of copywriting is important to have. And I think that AI like takes away from, like learning the skill, you know? And I was like, I think that's a super silly thought to have. And what I imagine every single student you have thinks is that you're probably just trying to scam them into buying a copywriting course. And they probably think AI is gonna take that job away and that it's not gonna exist. I was like, in comparison, if you sold how to do copywriting and make the work more efficient by leveraging AI, I think it would play into a current macro trend. I think you would make a lot more money from playing into that macro trend. And I also think that your offer would come off as more believable, just as a result of starting to actually sell the same exact offer, but with AI integrated into it instead of against it And, you know, he kind of sat there for a bit and like let it sink in. And, you know, he went back home. In the next month, he had gone from like 300K to 500K a month. The month after that, he cracked like 600K a month. I'm not sure where he's at right now in this most recent month, but I'll say this. I mean, you look at the guy and it's like a renewed take on life, you know? He's got a tremendously better attitude. His energy's fully back. I mean, the guy is completely recovered and expanded beyond where he was previously in terms of revenue ceilings, all as a result of aligning that offer to the current macro trend. It's not like he's trend jumping in that example. It's an evolution of his niche. You know, a great example of this, again, I'm not gonna say who because these people specifically have asked me not to talk about their revenue numbers. So again, this specific Inner Circle member, like dude, they're about to crack $3 million this month. And they have an offer just teaching people how to run essentially a business that integrates AI into other people's businesses. It's kind of like a modern agency, just with different skills. Instead of marketing skills, it's AI skills. And they're fucking killing it, dude. They've made like couple hundred thousand dollar leaps every month. So again, it's like, listen, there are certain things that like when they come along, they make perfect sense to attach your wagon to. And there are other things that don't. Like as an example, like every person I've ever known who sells something in the crypto niche makes a fuckload of money during bull markets, and they make a fuckload less money during bear markets. And like their revenue expands and contracts relative to the essentially Bitcoin price. And anyway, long story short, it's like AI is not like that. Like AI is more of like a new technology that's gonna have a mass market integration into every way of life. It's not going away. You know, its interest level might normalize and kind of plateau through time, that's for sure. But for now, it's like a great example of how to track this, by the way. Like if you use tools like SimilarWeb or, you know, some of the other ones that are available to track like web analytics, you can look at ChatGBT's web analytics each month. Like they average, like they average right now. They have 700 million users that pay to be on their platform. They have a total of like 170 million people a day that use their website, you know? And that's going up, not down. So as an example, it's like, you know, as that continues to expand and as more people integrate into it, yeah. I mean, having an offer that's more aligned to, you know, what people currently want makes a lot of sense. It's a natural thing to do when there's an evolution in your market, okay? And there are other people in this case that are paying money to seed those kinds of thoughts in the heads of your users. Like one great example of this, again, I'll share this with you guys here, just, you know, due to the fact you guys are the highest level people that I'll communicate to. This thing that we're gonna push with Tai Lopez, we're putting a million dollars behind a challenge funnel in a month. And literally, every offer that we're talking about promoting is something to do with AI, whether it's like the AI SMMA. And by the way, I'd be super careful using the word SMMA. Tai Lopez owns the trademark for that, and you know, he could rug your entire business at any point he chooses to do so when you use a term that he made up and owns the trademark for. But we got like AI SMMA. We were talking about doing like a high ticket closing offer that, imagine as an example, teaching high ticket closing, but instead of having to learn all the skills, you just have an AI that sits there while you're on Zoom with somebody, listens to the call and is telling you what to say to the counterparty based on world-class training and offer details specific to what you're selling. Like AI e-com is an example. There's inner circle members right now that do two and a half million dollars a month with AI e-com offers. Simply put, the revenue gets carried to very high levels when you attach to something that has extremely high levels of interest. That's certain for sure. All right. Fair enough. Thanks. Yeah, no problem. Okay, cool. Anybody else have questions? Feel free to unmute yourself and ask away. I've got one question, Jeremy. Yeah, what's up? We have three sellers right now. Over the course of six months, I've seen a very specific trend I've never seen before. One seller of the sellers has a 75 percent show-up rate consistently, and the other two have 45 to 50, and they do the exact same process. I don't get behind why one has like 75, and the others are like in the 40s to 50s. Can you articulate the process? Yeah, sure. It's a VSL funnel. They opt in with their email, name, phone number. Then they watch the VSL, and then they can book a call with Calendly. They book a call. Then right after they book the call, the sellers reach out to them with a selfie video, and on the day of the call, when the call happens, they text them in the morning again to just remind them of the call and get on the call. Everyone follows the same script for the video and the same text messages. I'm so in the weeds right now. I'm analyzing like profile pictures on WhatsApp because this is like the only variable left, and like the names, but it's all the same, yet different show-up rates consistently over months. Well, I mean, the videos, as an example, have a pretty wide range of how they can be interpreted. Like, first of all, human beings are extremely judgmental. As an example, there's a much higher response rate to women than there are men in the sales process. There's a much higher, you know, just tolerance of bad behavior from beautiful people compared to if ugly people have bad behavior. I mean, throw them in jail forever. There's a wide range of acceptance just based on all kinds of things that most people don't like to acknowledge or judged on. So, as an example, like, it could literally just be how the setters look, it could be their tonality, it could be their authenticity, it could be whether they seem genuine and actually believable or not. As I'm sure you can imagine, if I walk into a car dealership and there are three salespeople, and I interpret two of them to be sleazebags, I'm not gonna fucking talk to those ones. I have a much higher probability of leaving and not buying a car versus if I have one that I think genuinely is there to help me and, like, you know, wants to actually like sell me a car and seems genuine about the answers they give me and that they care for me, you know. That, again, that can be interpreted pretty strongly just based on them saying the exact same words within a video because all those things are interpreted not by the words but how the words are spoken. That all matters a lot. The time of day that they're communicating to people can make a huge difference, and obviously the cause itself. Does that make sense? Yeah, makes sense. But it's just so, I don't know, we just started with selfie videos. Before that, it was like just text messages with the same scripts and everything, and it's like a trend over hundreds of setting calls. I'll give you an example of the bottleneck analysis when it comes to some of the sub-statistics. Are they all sending from iPhones? Yes, we're using WhatsApp. Everyone in Germany uses WhatsApp. Does one of them have a more appealing number than another? Is one of them texting at a better time of day than the others? It could be the case. I have to get into that. Are there literally no differences or are you just gaslighting yourself into saying there are no differences? Maybe I'm gaslighting myself. Yeah. Have you actually audited the differences across a larger swath of data than a handful? It's kind of hard for me to analyze it because I don't know what they're doing on their phone. They are not sending. Yeah, but it's not hard at all because you can have a WhatsApp desktop app and you can have them share their screens or you could just have them jump on Zoom on mobile and have them share their screens and go into WhatsApp. I didn't do that yet. I have to do that, yeah. See what I mean? So you're not even QC-ing it and then you're over here making pretty big assumptions about a wide discrepancy of 30 plus percent per show rate. I would imagine you need to actually look at it to see if there are differences instead of just gaslighting yourself into saying there are no differences. That's true. Yeah. That makes sense, thank you. Okay, very good. All right, other questions? All right, you unmuted yourself. Do you have something you wanted to add to that? No, just listening in intently Just trying to absorb as much on my first call. Very good, sir. Does anybody else have anything? All right, tremendous. Reminder, we're coming up on June tomorrow. Fuck last month. Okay, close out today strong. Close out May strong. And then to be clear, go into June strong tomorrow. Make June a banging month. We only have 30 days in June instead of 31 like we did in May, so today's a little bonus session. You're in overtime right now. Then we got our upcoming Q3 mastermind, July 12th and 13th here in Miami. We'll be announcing the speakers here in the coming days. Be attentive to the chat for that. We'll also be releasing all the details relative to best hotels to stay at and all that fun stuff. But again, July 12th and 13th here in Miami for our Q3 mastermind. If you have any questions, per usual, shoot me a DM. Looking forward to seeing you guys there. Thank you for being on the call and talk soon. Bye. Thanks, Jim
