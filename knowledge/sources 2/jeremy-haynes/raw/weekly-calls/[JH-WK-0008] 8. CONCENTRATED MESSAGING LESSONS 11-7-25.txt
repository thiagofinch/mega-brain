8. Concentrated Messaging Lessons 11-7-25.mp4 Now, once they come through the DMs, I wanted to get your opinion or your thoughts on, do you believe that it's better? Because right now, due to the fact that we're selling, obviously... course, the DMs are ending up being very long and in-depth conversations with our setters because we have to build that massive belief and we have to build a lot of trust around the product before we start to go straight for the pitch or straight for the set. Do you think that we should keep that longer DM process or should we switch it over to a more, I guess, a faster DM process? Setting the process, because the product is a little bit different and the product is a little bit, I guess you could say, more straightforward. It's an automated algorithm. And then focus on the back-end resources after they get set, rather than front-loading those resources. If you've got a process that works right now, I wouldn't interfere with that, because then you're... Then you're introducing an entirely different friend and attraction model that you've got to test and prove out, which can take a daunting amount of time and money to figure out. So what I'm doing now is currently working. I would leave it at that. Maybe you can make it a little bit more efficient. I kind of treat it like concentrated coffee versus like a regular coffee. You know, have you ever gone? and seeing one of those little bottles that's full of like concentrated brew and it tells you to like take a cap of it and put it in water. I remember, um, One time I accidentally bought a bottle of that off Instacart and it showed up and I was like, the fuck is this? and you know, I'll be fair and say that's actually really changed my perspective about like marketing communication, as a result of getting so. I guess it's good, but long story short, the um. Like, as an example, I usually frame it like this when I'm talking about the hammer them email sequence or just like value-dense email sequences in general, where I'm like, 'Look, some people get the. benefit of like actually being able to send six a day and their demographic enthusiastically looks forward to every single fucking email and reads them thoroughly. And in other demographics, they're going to fucking bitch at you if you send two a day. And as a result of the lower quantity demographics, I give the advice of you need to find a way to have like your version of concentrated cold brew where you have like a cap of it that gets you the same effect of an entire cup of coffee that otherwise would. Be obviously consumed with far more liquid to get the same effect. That means that you have to find, like, the specific communication that your demographic looks at is like highly valuable within a specific concentrated communication, which is rather hard, like, as a good example of this, you know, Ryan Clogg, who we've given a five million dollar a month trophy to here in the group. It was just like tweeting back to me to some random Andromeda tweet that my team put out. And he was like looking for legitimate advice through tweet replies. And I made sure to emphasize, I was like, 'Dog,' you're not going to get what you're looking for here. Like, no, like I'll give you some general advice, but like, no, this is not where it happens. And that's my point is like in. In that context, like, I don't think that there's a lot that I could condense down to a really finite amount of like short words to express everything that's required of you with Andromeda best practices, you know? And that could be my fault. You know, I might just not know it well enough. Yet to truly like distill it down to three sentences. I personally look at it like it's far more complex than being it because it's very circumstantial and there's a lot of variance given the circumstances. So without knowing the context of the circumstances, it's hard to give that specific, concentrated context. In other instances, there's plenty of things that I can distill down. Think about this quote as a great example of this. It's easy to hate the rich. It takes courage to hate the poor. You know that's a great example of a quote that, like, as soon as you say, 'Damn,' like there's a lot to unpack there. But at the same time, it's like a concentrated hit to the chest of a single sentence with few words in that single sentence, at that, you know, there's certain things. Things that like you hear that are just like a reply that somebody gives you where, like, it changes your entire worldview forever from how impactful that singular sentence or set of sentences was. And that's all— it took is my point is an extremely efficient communication. So I will say, out of any of the. Of the like marketing-related advice that I think I've ever given, I do believe that this is one of the harder things to like take action on. Because at the end of the day, if everybody was a master at that— or even had the capacity to like ideate around that— we'd all be far more effective with the things that we say to one another and we'd all be like power quote bombing all the time, you know. And very few people do that. So, but I think it's one of the harder marketing skills, but anyway, my point is it remains the same regardless. If you do manage to figure out what specific like power quotes or like concentrated things you could send to people that give like an exponential amount of perceptual value, but in far fewer words or far less consumption. Naturally, you'll have an excessive amount of efficiency that you immediately execute on and shortening that DM conversation. But until you until you figure out what that is, like you're likely to have more of a long and drawn-out conversation, like a long and drawn-out sales process. There's a great one, you know, Andy for selling. I presume. Yeah. Any any one of my my actual literal first clients ever was named Lee Haight. And I still work with him today and lead. He pays people all the time to like learn things from them. And he paid Andy Frisella. And Andy had told him in there—a conversation about Lee's roofing company that does 50 million a year. He's like, 'Every business needs a magic question He's like, 'The magic question is something that when you hear it, it just immediately leads to a close.' It's essentially the same logic, but just framed differently. And Andy and Lee had gone back and forth to attempt to develop this magic question for Lee. And Lee goes door to door. He has massive door to door teams that go and like pitch people on. Essentially representing them to their insurance company to get a roof replacement without them having to come out of pocket. Lee makes the profit off of whatever the difference is between the cost of the roof and what the insurance company pays. And. Obviously, there's a lot of friction when you go to somebody's door and just pitch them on getting up on their roof and fucking trying to make an insurance claim. And the magic question that they boil it all down to is essentially, and this might not be word for word, but it's like relatively close. It's essentially that there was damage. And I was able to prove that. Would you want the insurance company to pay for it? So you have a roof that protects you, your family, your home. This is your foundational asset. There was damage. Would you not want the insurance company to cover it? And then the question is like a dummy question where it's like, well, yeah, obviously I would. And then it's like, great. I'm going to get up on the roof then. And I'm going to do a damage report. And we're going to call the insurance company if there's damage. And we're going to, you know, it's like immediately. So simply put, like most of the time. Businesses are wildly inefficient with the ability to develop, like, even just a simple version of what I'm trying to teach you right now, which is the magic question, let alone the additional insights that one could provide further. That would lead to the same kind of conclusions, like, this is very obvious that, you know, I would need, I would need to do this. Generally. Most people don't even think in this context. So I like to at least communicate this as something that I think is a great way to think, because if you do actually use this as like a filter when you're reviewing these things, you'll see the inefficiency clear as day. And you'll look at it in the same context that I'm looking at it now. And you'll also naturally unlock a new level of thinking, which is the concentrated community. Like, what specifically can you say in far fewer words and in far fewer back and forths that lead to the same conclusions that are being made now over a far more drawn out period of time? It's not. It's not that you're communicating over a broad duration of time. It's the fact that, over that broad duration of time, those same mental ahas and those same like perceptual value hits are happening, but they're just happening in wildly inefficient ways, comparatively to the concentrated hits that could otherwise be happening in. And again, it's the same thing. One just leads to a far shorter duration of time to get that same conclusion made. You understand? Yeah, no, a hundred percent. That makes a lot of sense. Yeah. Fantastic. Awesome. Well, that's all I was wanting to break down today. I'm going to keep shooting you some, some DMS and telegram to continue following up with more questions as I, as I know, I will have them, but awesome.
