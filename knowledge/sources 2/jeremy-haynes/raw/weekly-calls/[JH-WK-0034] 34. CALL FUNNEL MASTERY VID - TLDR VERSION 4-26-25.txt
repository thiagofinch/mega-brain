34. Call Funnel Mastery Vid - TLDR Version 4-26-25.mp4 Sorry, there's no ladies. It's all gentlemen. All right. Welcome to the weekly group call. Today, we're going to be going through. Just a current best practices guide on call funnels. I realize it's been a bit of time since we've gone through in just a condensed way and talked about call funnels, all the best practices of them. I'm going to kind of do like a too long, didn't read version of it. That way I condense everything into a singular video for us. We're going to call it a master video. So without further ado, let's dive in. So number one, when we talk about call funnels, obviously, we're talking about essentially VSLs that have applications. Schedulers, and give people the opportunity to book with us direct onto the calendars. When we go through this process, obviously, our main goal and intention is to attempt to get qualified people through. Scheduled, talking with the closers, and obviously buying and piffing, okay? Um, let's go. Call Funnel Best Practices. All right. So number one, let's start with some of the direct response. Obviously, here in the inner circle, our weekly group call library, we have entire videos that talk and discuss. On each one of these steps in rather excessive detail. I will be putting together an SOP on call funnels where we kind of combine all of that into a doc. But to be clear, like I said, just to kind of do like a too long, didn't read version of this. We generally start with call funnels just doing direct response. If we have a warm audience to target, that's great and preferential. If we have to do cold audiences, that's also fine. Direct response is pretty simple for these. There's not a lot that we have to cover on this besides the standard stuff. What we're trying to do is bring in qualified people. And usually on this step, it starts with the messaging. One key thing that underlays every single step. Within this process is the lesson and value of targeting and talking to the right type of people that we actually want coming through and converting on these things. But we... don't communicate effectively and talk to the demographic that we actually want to convert, we're going to have a bad time. I'll give you a great example of this. We have a client right now. Where we initially started off. It's an info client selling a real estate offer on this concept called co-living. And when we started off, all we would really communicate is. The offer, in general, we would say: like here's what co-living is, here's a little bit about how it works, you know, if you're interested in it, like, you know, press this button, go watch the video I put together for you. Now, that was good. However, it didn't bring in the most qualified people. One example of messaging that we applied was: that immediately made a substantial difference was we said the exact same videos. And at the beginning of every video, we just started it off with. If you have $70,000 liquid or access to $70,000 in capital, pay attention. I'm going to introduce you to a new real estate opportunity. And then we would say the exact same stuff. So sometimes messaging looks like qualifiers. And other times, messaging can just be differences of specific words. So, as an example, if I target rich people. I don't want to use words like cash, money. I want to use words like revenue, capital, liquidity. Um, okay. Just slight differences in terms. Make the biggest difference to who originates through the funnel. So, when we look at the simple direct response that we typically start with in call funnels. We have to use it to call out who specifically we're going after. If you have cold targeting nowadays, you're generally also going to be doing advantage audience targeting if you're on Facebook. Obviously, the other ad platforms currently don't have their variations of this rolled out by default on your account. They do have their own variations of it. But they don't have it rolled out by default like Facebook and Instagram does. So long story short, if you have the advantage audience by default turned on on your account when you're doing your targeting, that essentially just means you're defaulted to broad. And if that's the case, that means that you have to understand messaging, okay? Messaging and the standard event you optimize for. is what determines who you actually target. OK, so in that example I gave you with the co-living offer, it was cold targeting. I had no warm audience to target. It was completely cold. So the singular difference that made a better quality person come through is just adding that qualifier at the beginning. of talking about, do you have $70,000 liquid? or access to $70,000 in capital that you're able to invest. Okay. So again, very simple. It all starts with messaging and it all starts with just standard direct response. No complicated shit. Remember this rule. We always want to do what has the least friction first. And then as time goes on, we slowly are going to increase the friction if necessary. Okay, like I'm not gonna buy default launch with the Venus Fly Trap. I'm going to by default launch with standard direct response ads. I'm not going to by default add like 15 fucking questions to my application. I'm going to add the smallest quantity of questions that are qualifying people and/ or that my salespeople are actually going to leverage in the sales call. Through time, I'm going to make adjustments and add more friction. Okay, only if necessary. Always start with the simplest stuff first. Do me a favor, drop a one in the chat if that makes sense. And if you're picking up what I'm putting down so far. Again, trying to do like a too long, didn't read version of call funnel best practices here. If you want a lot more in-depth information on direct response, we have several resources that can support you, including our newest SOP at the time of filming this video, which is our direct response. Ad Creation Framework, SLP. There's also a too long, didn't read version of it, which is much shorter. This version is about six pages in length. The other version that we just looked at here is the expanded version. It's about 52 pages in length. In addition to those, we also have our inner circle weekly group call library that has almost an hour and a half call just on direct response and all the best practices of it. That's not what this specific video is about. We're just talking about call funnels in general and the best practices. So we'll continue to the next step. Next step is generally our page. Our pages are still super simple. What we see consistently work the best on call funnels is a headline, a VSL, and an embedded application. Ideally, the application also has the scheduler built into it. The scheduler being built into it helps reduce drop-off. I do want to be fair in saying that we still technically see drop-off when we combine the application and the scheduler. But through Typeform as an example, we have a feature now called Partial Submit, which gives us the ability to still capture that application data. And we see a substantially smaller drop-off when we combine the application and the scheduler into one. Comparatively, if we have the application on one page and then the scheduler on the next, usually we see about a 50% drop. At this specific step. If they're separated. If we combine the application and the scheduler onto the same page, meaning right here. we typically will see a drop of about 15%. OK, meaning people will still fill out the app that are qualified, but we'll see about 15 percent of them drop off. And not actually complete the application. By ending it by submitting a call. They'll complete the app, but they won't schedule. We still literally right now are seeing type form. And. Calendly work best. We do have clients mainly when we do Josh Troy deals where they do. Schedule once, and that's by their preference. Anybody that listened to Josh Troy's mastermind talk, he explicitly said. In order for him to be able to scale up his operations and his systems efficiently, they have to have like... the exact same software across almost every deal. So I want to be very direct in saying, though, that doesn't mitigate what I just described with that 50% drop off. When we are forced to use tools like schedule once, go high level, HubSpot, whatever fucking alternative tools people like to use. Again, 50% drop between app and scheduler is pretty standard. When we use the type form and Calendly combo, we reduce that drop to about 16%. That's generally where we end up at as an average when we use that comparatively. And we still capture the person's data with the partial submit. Okay, there's this new function. It's not necessarily like brand new to be clear, but I mean, it's new relative to how we're talking about it now. Where we'll see right before we place the scheduler or at different points in the application. Just that little function called 'partial submit' still captures the data, regardless if they fill out the call schedule part of it or not. I do also want to be clear. We have an entire weekly group call that goes through application question best practices. and what types of questions you should ask and in what order, just to kind of, again, stay at a high level here on this call specifically, where I'm trying to do like a too long, didn't read version of a call funnel best practices guide with you guys. I like to start off. With. a financial qualifying question or just a qualifying question in general, preferably It's some type of just standard non-financial qualifying question. And the second question is where I love to do my financial qualifiers. From there, the only additional questions I'm asking are things that the salespeople are actually going to leverage in their sales calls. Okay? If. Those closers are not going to leverage the application data. that you are getting in your apps, there's no reason to get those in your apps at all because you're just adding friction. I do, however, want to ensure. That I have qualifiers to route people to one of two confirmation pages, potentially up to three, depending on how you choose to do your app grading. Real quick, before I continue, I just want to take a moment to answer any questions. I see one from Jose here in the chat. Jeremy, add direct to VSL, no opt-in. Yes, thank you very much for that question. We. When selling to rich people, never use opt-ins. There's no sense at all. We're having an opt-in for rich people. Okay. There's no point in that. There are tools, which I will discuss now, such as getemails. com or retention.com. Which can both enable you to capture users' data without having to force them to opt in. So retention . com is a great example of that. Again, there's another tool called Get Emails. You essentially are just placing like a pixel on the page. When it identifies the person based on places that they've visited in other places already opted into and given their information from, and it matches to their IP address. You have to make sure you add it to your privacy policy. And you also have to make sure you add it to like your cookie banner consent tools for those who are targeting the EU and California, as examples, to use these tools. But again, we can still capture their data. Without actually having to add the friction point of capturing their data. So we don't give a fuck about adding an opt-in. When we target the general public, we will. In almost all instances, we use an opt-in. Because they are much slower at making decisions. They have a much lower probability to actually convert. One thing I also want to take a quick note on. Usually this page's conversion rate generally comes out to about 3% to 7%. So that means the quantity of people that hit the page that actually book a call and are qualified and report back to the ads manager as a qualified call that was booked. Usually, we see about 3% to 7% of people actually convert. So obviously, that means that we have 93% to 97% of people that are not going to convert. And that's OK. That's where we have retargeting. That's where we can push people to other conversion mechanisms. Um, don't be shocked if you see that conversion rate. Generally, that level of conversion rate can create, all the way up to, about $50. All the way up to about $300 on average for a cost per scheduled qualified call. Which we're totally cool with in all our financial modeling. We generally see that that results in an extremely profitable like 5x plus ROAS outcome when we see those types of conversion rates. OK, again, just want to take a moment to answer any other questions before we continue on. Anybody have anything? Feel free to unmute yourself now. Drop it in the chat if you'd like. Ask away. Give you guys a few seconds. Okay. Cool. We'll continue on. So. Usually, what happens from here is one of two things. Usually, we'll drive people over to two different confirmation pages. I want to be fair in saying sometimes we will push them to upwards of three confirmation pages. Depending on how we do our app grading. So there's really two ways. That we can push people through the applications themselves, we can do conditional logic to determine where they are going to get routed to, or we can also do a logic score— is what it's called inside a type form, which is referred to as app grading. And based on their score, or based on their answers from their conditional logic, we will be pushing people to a qualified page. Or an unqualified page. Generally, what we will do... is we will add the standard event to the confirmation page where the qualified people go, we will typically use schedule or complete registration. I want to be fair in saying some of you operate in niches where you are under the new restrictions. Where you don't have the ability to use standard events, and that's okay. If that is the case, then this is where you're going to place your custom conversion code. Okay. So again, you're placing your standard event. On to... The qualified confirmation page. You can still pixel the unqualified people, but you are not placing any kind of standard event code here. OK, this is very important to understand. We're not placing standard event code. You can, if you'd like, add a custom conversion just to track these people inside of the ad dashboard if you want. But we will not use a standard event code on this page. We would only add a custom conversion for the sole purpose of tracking them, since obviously we're not going to be optimizing around unqualified people. I do want to disclose as a pro tip real quick. The other smart reason to pixel this unqualified page is sometimes people lie. So if you get a fuckload of people that you notice are coming through unqualified that are actually qualified people and they're just lying on the application, adding the custom conversion code gives you the ability to optimize around those people too if you ever choose to do so. That's a very rare instance where you would need to break that out. However, it does help a lot in the instance that, again, you're getting people that just straight up lie, okay? Now, if you notice between these two different pages that I just discussed, we're using pixel code, okay? Which means that we are autonomously firing off. Who's qualified and who's unqualified, solely based on the answers to their questions that they've provided us in the application. Now, again, as you guys know, people lie. So if they do lie and if we're seeing. Let me give you a few examples. If I'm seeing inconsistency in lead quality. So let's say that I get a few days where the salespeople are saying the leads are really good. And then I get a few days where the salespeople are saying leads are really bad. That's okay. Okay, that's okay. I can solve that by instead of using the pixel code. I can use the conversion API. Okay, so let me articulate this next step real quick for you guys so you guys understand. Once these people go from these confirmation pages here. They're obviously going to get put into the CRM. Now in the CRM, this... is where I can have the conversion API fire off. Instead of my pixel code autonomously firing people off to the pixel. Okay. And therefore that results column on Facebook. Let me articulate this clearly and make sure you guys understand this, okay? Because it's really kind of an either-or scenario for us. If I am getting... Good, consistent feedback from my salespeople. That they like the lead quality. They have no issues with the lead quality. Okay, they're happy with the lead quality. I am going to stick to the autonomous pixel firing. Okay, I'm going to stick to the pixel code on the website. If I'm getting feedback from the salespeople. That qualified people are lying. And they actually end up being unqualified. I don't want to feed that data back to the pixel. Okay, I want to control the data that goes back to the pixel. So how do I do that? I do that with the conversion API. Okay. The conversion API can be fired off in two ways. Okay, so just recently we've been using a tool it's called Lead Phi. These guys don't pay me, but they wanted to. We tried in the group through one of our members, Jimmy, to come up with a solution that was a little cheaper than what LeadFi charges. They'll charge like $2 to $3 a lead. Let me be really clear in saying, I think you can negotiate these guys down. Give or take the volume and like the quantity of referrals that you could send their way. But it's generally about $3 a lead. And all they're really doing is they're getting you FICO credit scores. And they're also getting you IRS income that's been reported based on the leads that come in. So if I... Get lead by data. And I enrich the data of the information that I've acquired from the lead with a FICO score and an income. I can create conditional logic in my CRM that says: If their FICO score is above this, and if their income is above this, send them back to the pixel for that standard event that I'm optimizing for. That'll ensure, regardless of the application questions, that the qualified people, based on credit scores and income, get pushed back to the pixel. But again, that's done through enriching the data first, through a third-party tool like LeadFi. And then creating conditional logic within your CRM to push those people back through the conversion API in place of the pixel, autonomously firing people off. Okay, the other way that I can do this is just salespeople. Marking who's qualified and who's unqualified after speaking with the leads. Okay. So you guys know how you have salespeople that typically have like stages of the pipeline. And you know, the first step might be like needs contacted. The second step might be like scheduled or applied. The third step is like, you know, whatever it is. If they have a stage that they put people into that marks them as qualified, like let's use the example that, like, this specific bucket represents that they're qualified. As soon as a lead gets placed into that bucket, I can do the same exact thing. After a salesperson talks to them on the phone, manually moves them into a deal stage in my pipeline that shows that they're qualified, I can have marketing automation fire off that leads information through the conversion API back to the pixel to represent who was qualified and who's unqualified. Now, the one pro tip in this for what's important to understand between these two differences is technically the lead-fi solution will be faster. Because you're acquiring the lead. You're enriching the data of that lead within like seconds or minutes. And then my conditional logic might take another minute to fire off that lead back to the platform, the ad platform. And therefore hit that results column. The faster I get data back to the platform that I'm advertising from in that results column, the more entrenched the ad platform is in that type of audience. You see, very important to understand. In comparison, if I get the person to schedule a call. And then it takes, like, three days on average. For my salesperson, to do this and mark that they were qualified or not. I'm going to have a three-day delay in the data. firing back to the ad platform where they originated from. Now, that might not sound bad, but here's the downside of that. The downside of that is if that platform, that ad channel, does not get that data back hitting the results column. What's it do? It switches the audience that it's targeting because its whole purpose, when it's not getting data back in that results column, is to get data back into the results column. You see? So if it's going after a specific subset of people and it's not getting data, it thinks it's failing. So then it switches people. It moves to a different bucket of people that it's going to target next. All in an attempt to try to get people to hit that pixel. You see, a suit, all it knows is it's blind, guys, like it doesn't have vision. Okay. How does it know if it's working or not? How does the giant prediction machine on these ad channels know if it's working or not? Based on the data that hits that results column. Okay. So if no data hits that results column, it's going to change audience types and it's going to move into a different bucket of people. When it gets data back to that result column, especially in a high quantity at a high frequency. It entrenches itself into that audience type and it tries to stay as close as it can to that type of person as it continues to try to find more people like them. You see what I'm saying? So to be clear, and just to reiterate, if I am getting... Qualified people. That just through the standard pixel being placed on my page and they're actually qualified, okay if that's happening. Great. Stick to that. If I am getting inconsistency in the qualified people showing up and actually being unqualified. And my salespeople are saying, 'Hey man, like some days they're good and some days they're shit.' That's because people are lying on the application. And they're hitting your pixel. And remember, the pixel goes after whoever hits it. You see? So if that's the case, I'm gonna take the pixel code, I'm gonna leave it on the page— it's okay to leave it on the page. But I'm gonna remove... the standard event code that's on the pages. Okay, so again, if I'm getting inconsistency. In lead quality, that's generally because the people are lying. And if they're lying, Okay, I can leave the pixel on the page. But I'm going to remove the standard event code. And I'm going to instead switch. To the conversion API. Okay, and I'm going to do those one of two things. I'm either going to have a tool like LeadFi. Warp. I'm going to have my salespeople. Wait until they determine if somebody's qualified or unqualified. Mark that in the CRM. And you can do it in more ways than just the deal stage pipeline, by the way. You could do it by the salesperson adding a tag to the contact record. You could do it by having a custom drop-down box in the CRM on that contact or deal opportunity that just literally says qualified or unqualified. You see? So again, my point being. If I'm getting inconsistency through my call funnel and lead quality. Okay, but I'm still getting good volume. I want to I want to assume control. In the best way possible, which is through the conversion API to get that data back to the results column instead of the pixel itself. Again, I'm just going to take a moment, answer anybody's questions. Make sure that we all understand this before we continue to these next steps. Jeremy, I have a question. What? So, if you're going to have your salespeople determine whether they lie or not in the application. How do you solve for the speed to send the information back to the pixel? The salespeople would need to talk to the leads faster. Mmm. Okay, because usually what happens is someone completes the application and books the call with the seller. So, I mean, not always that call happens within 24 hours, right? Bye. Bye. I would have to have the setter reach out before the schedule call or don't schedule calls with setters at all. Ideally, they reach out fast because, remember, there's an unknown time period. Nobody can give you a solid answer. And if they do, they're making it up on how long it takes without getting data in that results column. Before it switches audience types. Okay, nobody can give you a solid answer on that. I like to project and assume that it's somewhere between about 72 hours. So simply put, if my ad campaign does not get data for about 72 hours, we typically see it switch. We see it switch audience types that it's going after. OK, so simply put, my biggest risk of having my salespeople be the ones that mark people qualified or unqualified out of my total leads is that first 72 hours of the campaign. Okay, now here's the good news. Even if it does switch audience types. As soon as it gets data back to it, it typically will bias towards who's reporting back to the pixel. So we can also assume. That when or if it switches audience types that it's targeting, due to a lack of data reporting back to it. That as soon as we get data reporting back to it, it'll switch back to that original audience type. We can assume that. But it might not happen instantly. It might take a few more days. You see, you got to factor that into the equation. I do like it when companies have speed to lead. And the only thing I don't like about putting it in the hands of the salespeople is— look, I mean, sometimes salespeople are just fucking stupid. You know, like they mark leads as qualified or unqualified based on if they showed up or not. Based on whether they responded to a text or not, you know, based on like something that just happened on the call. We have to really trust our salespeople if we're going to put this in their hands. OK, so we have to train the salespeople on how this logic works, too. They essentially control the targeting based on who they allow to be marked as qualified or unqualified. If you do put it into their hands, that makes sense. Yeah, that makes total sense. Now, Jeremy, another quick question that I have. Is there any reason why you would separate? They schedule your call from the application because right now we're running our application in Typeform. And through logic, I'm choosing who to show the last question of the application, which is literally the book your call through Calendly. Is there any reason why you're having the confirmation page and not directly in the Typeform application? Yes. So to be clear, when we have the application and the scheduler together, and we route them to a confirmation page. We're going to talk more in detail just right after I finish this point here on the conversion API logic. On confirmation page, breast practices, I, I assume you're asking, like, why not just keep them right there and type form and give them an end screen? We don't do that because, again, we can't pixel it properly and because we can't build out that page. To be as good as we need it to be for the confirmation best practices that we want to see. We want to see, like, breakout videos and testimonials and a bunch of framing content on the confirmation page. So we don't we don't want to keep them in type form after they officially complete it with a type form end screen, if that's what you're asking. No, so what happens is, so imagine in Typeform, you're building all your questions. And the last question is actually a Calendly link, which is inside the Typeform. So what happens is as soon as they book. They get redirected to the confirmation page. What was happening to us is we're getting a lot of qualified people completing the application. And then, in the book your call, they would not book their calls. So in between those two steps, just make sure you have the partial submit. Again, you'll have a much lower drop off when they're embedded like that than you will if you put the scheduler onto a separate page. Like I said, we usually see about a 50% drop in qualified applicants scheduling. When we separate the scheduler from the application itself. While on average, we see about a 16% drop when we have the scheduler in the application itself. Okay, great. Other questions on this? Timothy in the chat, is that cost per qualified call? factoring in setters or just marketing booked calls. It's a cost per qualified booked call, Timothy. It's what the ads manager sees for a cost per qualified call. I assume that's what you're asking about. Okay, great. Yeah, the question was actually like before you had paused and asked if anyone had questions, you had mentioned the average call. You saw was like, it was 50 to 300. And so I was just curious if that factored in setters or if it was just— I just answered your question. It's the people who book the call right then and there that's qualified. Okay, so no setters would be factored in. Again, it is the quantity of people that booked right then and there on the page. That is what we're talking about. Okay. Thank you. Okay, awesome. We'll continue on. So let's talk about confirmation pages real quick. So on confirmation pages, we've talked about this before. And again, just to reiterate. We have an entire in-depth training. in the weekly group call library. Specifically, we spent a whole hour talking about this, going through confirmation page best practices and what we call modern due diligence, okay? These modern due diligence, modern show rate best practices all start with the confirmation page. We will cover it lightly here. Generally, on the confirmation page we have a headline that confirms they booked their call— Okay, from there, we will have a very short video at the top of this page. This video is generally something like this. It says, 'Hey, what's going on? Thank you for booking your call with us. My job from here forward is to help you do your due diligence, okay? You're going to have questions about the offer. You're going to have questions about us and whether we're legit. You're going to want to know about the result— potential. You're going to want to know about how fucked you could get if the deal goes wrong. We're going to answer literally all of those questions between now and your call starting right now on this page. My job from here forward is to help you do your research prior to the call to make sure you show up well-framed, well-educated, and totally aware of whether this is a good opportunity for you or not. I, from here forward, am here to help you hold your hand in that research journey. Go ahead and scroll down on the page and check out the videos. That you will find here answering some of the most common questions on our process. You then have two sections on this page. Okay, you have breakout videos and you have testimonials. Okay, everybody thinks that you just need to place the best testimonials on your page. You need to place the best, the worst, and the average. OK, I would fucking love to get a testimonial from somebody that's like, yeah, you know, I joined into the inner circle and it was pretty cool. I didn't really consume a lot of stuff. You know, I think honestly, within like six months of being in there, I watched like two videos from Jeremy. And I made back the money from what I spent. You know, I didn't do like spectacular. I didn't make like a million a month or like even a couple hundred grand a month. Well, you know, I easily paid for being a part of it. I would fucking love, you know, a testimonial like that because it would show something that is not just. Oh, dude, I fucking joined into this offer and like I made a fucking kajillion dollars and like it was the best thing ever. People don't believe. The cherry-picked testimonials that you have. They want to see how fucked they could get if they do the deal with you. OK, it's like when people go to a new restaurant, they don't just want to see all the good food photos. They want a motherfucker who's like. Yeah, you know, I went to the restaurant. I think it was a little overhyped. I mean, don't get me wrong, like it felt worth it and the food was good, but... You know, I don't think it was anything crazy. It's, you know, it's a good date night spot. Like the bread was good. You know, they want to see something like that, okay? Yes, they want to see the spectacular ones. But they also want to see like the low end of the spectrum too. OK, so the point of the testimonial section is to not just highlight the biggest and best fucking people you've worked with. Highlight an absolute fucking. No-name person who started off in like a super fucked condition and got like a little bit better than they are now— you know, like nothing crazy. Like, pick some average fucking testimonials too to put onto the page. Okay, pick some great ones, pick some average ones, and articulate to people in the testimonial section. And again, you're probably not going to capture this, okay? You're probably not going to have a testimonial of your shitty stuff. It's like, try to make a video for the testimonial section that says, 'Listen, here's how bad it could be if you did this deal with us.' That's what builds trust. OK, that's what builds trust is you being an actual fucking honest person and not acting like every single person who comes through your offer comes out the other side of fucking superstar. OK, they think you're full of shit when you do that. You have to be able to articulate. How bad the deal could be, and what you do if it ends up being bad. So let me give you an example of how I do this for the inner circle. We openly tell people, we're like, 'Listen. Like guys, you guys all just witnessed it the other day. My fucking salesperson sold some guy into the group who runs an automation business, which we think is a fucking retard offer.' You have to be dumb as fuck to run an automation offer in 2025 onward. From how fucking nuked that niche was. Every company went bankrupt. Not a single fucking company pulled it off. It was truly the worst niche that I've seen in my career to date. Okay. It was like a flash in a pan in and out in under two years. Okay. So when my sales guy sells somebody like that into the group. I immediately find out who it is and that that's what the guy does. And what did I do? What did I do to that guy? I fucking immediately kick him out of the group. Okay. Bye-bye. And we fucking refund the guy. It's like, I will now flex that on the front end of my. inner circle offer: I will openly state on my fucking confirmation page. Listen— if you somehow applied for this and like you're not the right person, we will literally kick you out. My whole group is a testament to that. They've witnessed it more than just once. You know, if somebody is dumb as fuck and they don't mesh well in the group, we kick them out and we give them their money back. We have seen people be like, 'I'll give you a good one.' There was a guy named Roy. Roy joined into the group with a marketer named Jerome. Jerome was smart and knew about marketing. Roy was an agency owner— is how he labeled himself. And he claimed that he knew a lot about marketing, too. Roy eventually says, within the first like two weeks of being a part of the group, 'Hey, I don't want to pay for Jerome to be a part of the group anymore. You know, can you drop him out? I said, 'Yeah, sure.' And I told Roy, 'I was like, listen, Roy. Just to be clear, you don't give me the impression that you're going to be like in the fucking trenches learning marketing and like mastering everything that we talk about in this group. Make sure now that you don't have Jerome in there, that you actually spend time putting your education hat on and consume the fuck and apply everything that we talked about in this group.' He says, 'Yeah, yeah, of course, man. Like, fuck yeah, I'm going to do it.' Within like two days, Roy sends me a question. He says, 'Remember, Roy's an agency owner.' Roy says in a question to me. 'Hey Jeremy, does a pixel belong on websites?' Again, a fucking agency owner says, 'Does a pixel belong on websites?' I instantaneously kick him out and refund him. Okay, that's me demonstrating how bad it can get and what I do when it's as bad as it can get. Okay. Yes. We have 15 people in the group that make more than a million a month. Okay. Yes. We have several, I don't even know the number, several people that make high hundreds of thousands of dollars a month. The true average for the group is about two to 300 K a month when somebody joins in. Those people typically take like three months. To make like an extra $100 a month. Which obviously pays for the inner circle fucking 10 times over. We like to say, look, we teach you a lot of one things that are going to make you a lot of money. Imagine how many one things you're going to learn over the course of the year that we want you to be in here. Okay, we have people that we still have literally almost all of our original members who joined in. You know, we have people that stay in here for years. What I'm trying to do here, guys, I'm trying to demonstrate, like, yeah, we have guys that have joined in at 100,000 and made a million. Those aren't the fucking testimonials I'm going to put on my damn page in mass. I'm going to show like one of those. I'm going to show a bulk of them being like the actual true average. And then I'm going to show some worst-case scenario ones for like how fucked it could be. If things go bad and what we do about it when things are, you see what I'm saying? Okay, now breakout videos. Breakout videos are also very important to understand. These are common questions. That comes up in your sales process that your salespeople hate having to talk about. These breakout videos are typically what get people further along in the sales process. Okay, so what salespeople typically hate. They hate talking to people that are in this part of the sales process at the beginning. Generally, they're pretty neutral to talking to people in the middle. These are generally the ones that require more follow-up calls. Whereas what they love talking to, who they love talking to, are the people who are further along in the sales process that are more probable to close. Okay, that's what they love talking to. So moral of the story is, if we do our jobs correctly as marketers, we can create more people in these two ranges. We can create more people that are in the probable to close zone and the neutral zone. We want to try to avoid people who are in the first part of the sales process. If you get a fuckload of people that are in this first part of the process here, you are doing an awful job with what I'm communicating to you right now. You likely don't have breakout videos. You likely have testimonial videos that people don't believe. You likely have reminder-based emails and no value-dense emails. And you likely aren't doing the hammer them campaign. OK, so again, just to continue on to all these other things I need to talk about, the confirmation page is where a lot of this starts. To make sure that you get people further along in the sales process, the breakout videos are extremely simple. And again, just to reiterate, we have a whole training going through in depth. Just about this, okay? But to reiterate, listen to your salespeople. Whatever questions they're talking to people about, those become the videos that you make breakout videos for. Okay. These are just very simple. You're talking to people in like two to five minute videos. Sometimes they're even shorter than that. And you're just answering a simple question. You know, so a good example, like for our master internet marketing offer, it costs $5,000. Okay. We have. Ayy. video on our master internet marketing confirmation page we're adding that says: 'Listen, the price of the program is $5,000. We don't want to put you into debt. We don't want to do a payment plan with you. You either have $5,000 to do it or you don't. Almost everything that we're going to teach you after requires you to have some money. We don't do deals. We don't fucking do discounts. We don't do anything other than paying fulls. If you want to get some kind of funding on your own, that's on you. We're not putting you into debt. We want you to be in a financially comfortable position if you buy this. Okay. That's a breakout video for us, okay? Some of the other things, like what comes with it. Okay. We'll answer those questions. We'll do a little demo video. We have a common question: How does it work? Like it's a live class, but what happens when there's not a live class? So we answer the questions about getting immediate access to the recordings. OK, again, just all the common questions that come up in your sales process are what you're going to answer here. Ash asks: Where is the training on the breakout video, please? Yes, Ash, go into the weekly inner circle group call library. And there is a call labeled 'Modern Show Rate Best Practices.' We talk about it in depth on that video. In addition to that, we also talk about it at the most recent mastermind. And also we talk about it at the Q1 Mastermind. The Q1 Mastermind talks about the trust flywheel. That is a great example of breakout video topics that you can leverage as well. Omar asks, 'What's the max?' And Omar, unmute yourself, ask your question. You mistyped. I was saying, 'What's the max number of breakout videos on the actual page?' You can have as many as you want. Generally, the number is somewhere between like six and 12, but don't feel limited to that. You can add as many as you'd like. Okay, cool. Thanks. Okay. Now, let's continue on. So there's obviously two other things that we're going to talk about with this that are all pre-sales calls, okay? Number one is the email sequences. So we need value-dense email sequences. These are typically education-based. They have sales assets. They have trust assets. And this is in addition to the reminder emails. Okay. Reminder emails should be limited to about three, maybe four max. Okay. This typically includes an initial confirmation of the booked call. Okay, a 24-hour reminder. A two-hour reminder. And a 10-minute reminder. Okay, that's typically all the reminder-based messages we did. We will typically also do text as well. And it's the same exact thing. 24-hour. Confirmation. Two hour. And then 10 minutes. OK, so that's four total reminder-based messages in terms of the value-dense emails. We will typically start off at about four a day. We will work our way up to about six a day. What we look for is that our open rate does not drop. OK, so simply put, we ideally want to see. That our open rate stays flat, okay. It's going to go up and down, give or take the specific emails. Okay, but we don't want to see this. We don't want to see a diminishing return on open rate as time goes on. Once you start to see a diminishing return, get rid of whatever emails come after that. Okay, you want to push up? The quantity of emails that you can send. Until you see a diminishing open rate. Okay, you can start it off at three if you want. You could start it off at four. Typically, we see that you can go up to six per day. Okay? Per day. The moral of the story is... Once you see a diminishing open rate. That is where you no longer send the emails. That makes sense. Drop a one in the chat if that makes sense and you're picking up what I'm putting down. One's in the chat if you're picking up what I'm putting down. Very good. Very good. Okay, let me be clear on these value-dense emails. A lot of people get frustrated, mainly salespeople. You'll hear this feedback commonly. Oh, they didn't watch the VSL. It's like some people even go as far as doing this dumb as fuck tactic. where they will have Ayy. question in their application that says, 'Oh, did you watch the video in full?' You know, some salespeople will not take a call unless somebody's watched the VSL in full. That's a retard play. That's a retard play. Do not do that. Okay? Never do that. Value dense emails and the Hammer Them strategy are where we are going to ensure we drop the pre-framed material that we want to ensure they consume. The confirmation page breakout videos are where we are going to add framing material that we want to ensure they consume. So let me reiterate, the confirmation page has more consumption than the VSL. The email has more consumption than the VSL. The Hammer Them campaign will have more consumption than the VSL. Therefore, all the things that our salespeople get frustrated are not answered. Belong where? On the confirmation page, in the email sequence, and in the hammer them strategy. If your salespeople say, 'Oh, I'm tired of people not watching the VSL,' you are failing miserably with confirmation page best practices, value-dense email sequences, and the hammer them campaign. That is where those questions and framing occur. OK, so again, value-dense emails. It's OK for them to be long. It's OK to take the same stuff. Let me tell you something as an educator. Okay? The amount of times that you individually will ask me questions for things that I've covered on a weekly group call that you've been on. That I've covered in a training library that you have access to, that I've covered at a mastermind where you were looking me in the eyes, that you'll then follow up and ask me in writing again a week later, okay, instead of getting frustrated. I just make more consumables for you. To help you get the information instead of getting mad at you. I create more consumables that reiterate the same things, okay? You must understand, as a business, the things that you want understood by your leads are going to be reiterated in all of these places. You will reiterate them in the BSL. You will reiterate them on the confirmation page. You will reiterate them in your email sequence. You will reiterate them in your hammer them content. Okay, it's very simple. You are going to take the things that you want people to know. And you're gonna put it in all four of these places. Again, drop a one in the chat if that makes sense to you. Okay. Eradicate the bad salesperson feedback. Drop a one in the chat if you're picking up what I'm putting down. Okay, super fucking simple. Super simple. We reiterate it everywhere. So what should my emails be about, Jeremy? They should be about the things you want people to know before they show up to a call. Okay, and they shouldn't be selfish and stupid. This is a very common mistake that some of y'all make. Where you're like, 'Treating people surface level with the answers you provide.' These should be, again, value-dense. Has a meaning. It's not a random. Hype term. Value-dense means that these are going to actually answer the questions likely better and in more explanation than what your salespeople would otherwise answer on a call. That way, by the time they get to the call, you're getting people that are in the neutral zone or the ready to buy zone. And you avoid people who are in the early stages of the sales process. You want people that are far along in the sales process. You answer their questions, they'd otherwise ask on sales calls before the sales call in depth. Okay. Very simple process. Anyway, to continue. And then the final thing we have is obviously the Hammer Them campaign. Just to reiterate, like I have for all the other things, we have an entire SOP. and many training videos. on the Hammer Them campaign in depth. Just to reiterate shortly, though. We have short form. And we have long form. that we are going to leverage. in the Hammer Them campaign. We typically have 20 to 30. long form videos and 30 to 50 short form videos. Let me tell you what drives me up a wall. when you guys do anything less than those numbers. Okay. You guys think. That a man like me who works with busy rich people for a living hasn't tested doing it with smaller quantities of content. A fucking course I have. You know how ridiculous it is for me to go to multi-million dollar a month earners and say, 'Hey, I need you to film 30 to 50 fucking short form pieces of content for me to help with our sales process.' Okay, of course I go to them and I say, 'Hey, can you do like 10?' And I saw that 10 didn't work. Then I said, 'Hey, can you do like 15?' And 15 didn't work. You know what I saw work? 30 to 50 pieces of short form content. You know what I saw work for long form? 20 to 30 pieces of long form content. Do not fucking hit me up and say, 'Hey man, my Hammer Them campaign's not working.' And I look at it. And you have like fucking 10 pieces of content in that bitch. Okay. You have to have the minimums. Put the work in. You will get more piffs. You'll get a higher close rate. You'll get higher show rates, okay? You will achieve the outcomes that the Hammer Them campaign is for. In terms of frequency, we ideally see a minimum frequency of 15 to 20 with the short form. Before the call. And with long form, we ideally see a frequency of 10 to 15 before the call. Okay. This is important you understand this. This is a really high quantity of pieces of content that are individually reaching people before your calls. It creates a massive familiarity bias cognitive effect. Okay, it also pre-frames, warms people up, and answers their questions just as all the other steps that we've talked about will do as well. Does this all make sense? Okay, at this point. Your fucking salespeople should have damn near layup deals. Okay, you should have a massive difference in the salesperson feedback that you get when you do it this way. That's the whole point of doing it this way— is you make it easier for your salespeople to close. That's the whole point of this, okay? Some of you, like I like to use Devin as an example. He didn't do the hammer them strategy. He didn't even do the fucking value-dense emails. He just did the confirmation page best practices. Devin, what was the improvement to your show rate after just doing? The confirmation page best practices. Yeah, it went to north of 85%. What was it at prior? Like 60, 60, 60, 60, 65. Yeah, 20 to 25% show rate improvement from just doing one of these three things. Okay. That's the point. We don't want to do one of the three things. It honestly drives me up a fucking wall when you guys only do one of the three things. Because again, you should be doing all of them. It's a combination of all of them. That's what's like the fucking powerhouse of call funnels right now. When you don't do all of them, you get a lower ROAS. You know, when you don't do all of them, it's harder for your salespeople to close and it therefore lengthens your sales process. You know, you dramatically lower your probability of getting a one-call close to like two or three over weeks. You know, when you do all this, it changes the game dramatically. Okay. Obviously, from here, need I not say that we then have the phone call. Okay. It's important to understand. I'm not going to sit here and go through all the best practices of the call. I'm not going to act like a sales trainer to you, but I will tell you this. In your training libraries, you all have access to a 70-part video course on sales training for the Hydra and for call funnel. It's labeled as sales training. You also have Josh Troy's most recent Mastermind Talk. From Q2 2025, he did two talks. However, he went through extensive amounts of information on sales management and sales best practices. If you look in our Mastermind Talks library, you also have... a lot of information. From past masterminds from sales trainers like Josh Troy and from Jordan Stupar as an example that go through all kinds of best practices for these things. OK, what I want to close with is after the sales call. So the post-call tactics. In our weekly inner circle group call library, there is an entire video on post-call tactics. Everything to do after the call happens. Okay, which really just includes using dispositions. I think I mix, I honestly think I fucked that word up every time. I'm just going to explain it a different way. When your salespeople, after they get off a call and didn't close somebody, have a little dropdown in the CRM that says. This person didn't close because of these reasons that they can then select. You ideally want to have contextual marketing automation that helps address some of those objections and gives that additional information. You also want to use through a report. You want to look at all those that are most commonly referenced as reasons people don't buy and go back and strengthen your front end part of the process, like your hammer them campaign, like your email sequences, and like your confirmation pages. OK, help your salespeople when you get those reports. Okay, I'm now going to spend some time just answering a few questions on this and then we're going to wrap it up and we're going to get out of here. So Jesus says, 'Quantity over quality and in quantity.' We see. Hold on one sec. We see which ones have the highest 100% retention rate and we keep the best 10. Then we record 40 to 50 more and we keep the best of those new ones to arrive at the perfect hammer. Yeah, you can do it that way, Jesus. I mean, listen, we just like to go through all those questions that are answered. If you read the Hammer Them SOP. It's four quadrants of content that we want to make. We want to answer questions. The second layer questions that come up after the first ones get answered. Expectation content and then objection content. It should be super easy to rip through 30. Keep in mind, we also have our Hammer Them software that we created. It is inside of the Hammer Them SLP. You can use command F on your computer and just type the word 'software'. When you're looking at the SLP, it'll take you right to it. And in that SOP, it talks in depth about how to use the software. Super easy though. You go in and you type some information into a few fields and we help you come up with what your 30 to 50 pieces of content should be. Devin asks, with the Hammer Them campaigns with call funnels, what kind of volume do we need for it to work? Great question, Devin. Ideally, you have, in that 72-hour time frame, at least 100 people that can get targeted. You're likely not operating at that volume of calls when you're first starting off. So you supplement it with people that are in the sales process actively that are still unclosed. Okay. You just want to widen it up a little bit at the beginning. Does that make sense? Yeah, it does. Thank you. Cool. Other questions, feel free to unmute yourself and ask away. Jeremy, quick question. Thoughts on... Tackle in the... the investment for our products in one of the breakout videos. Say that again. So in the breakout videos, could you talk about how much is the investment for the product? Yeah, absolutely. We love to do that, especially for rich people. I do want to be fair in saying that can spook the general public. And that can make it so they freak out and don't buy and don't show up because they're all money-conscious. With rich people, they view it as a huge waste of time if you don't tell them the price up front. A great example of this, name a single car that you don't own, but you still know the price of it. Like, what's a fucking Aventador cost? What's a Rolls-Royce Colonon cost? What's a fucking Huracan cost? What's a McLaren cost? You know the prices. You know the general range of what they cost. You don't go into the store until you're financially qualified to buy it. You know what Rolexes cost. You know what APs cost. You know what Paddocks cost. And you don't go waste their fucking time until you have the money to buy it. You see, it's like you're not not buying it. You're waiting until you're in a financial position to buy it. So you either waste your closers time or you just. Close the price and get people that show up well framed and ready to buy. Okay, the argument against doing that is well. Dude, I want more people to show up because I can convince them to buy anyway, right? And that's fine if that's what you choose to do. I don't choose to do that. I choose to disclose price and get financially qualified people to show up instead, and I respect the rich people's time. Okay, other questions. Yeah, Jeremy, I got one. So for Advantage Plus being turned on with the Hammer Them custom audiences, can you still do this or is there anything specifically to know about that? Is not exposed to Advantage Audiences Plus. That's the only thing that Facebook respects at this point is what you put into the custom audiences fields. They do not apply Advantage Plus targeting. To the custom audiences that you've put in there. They apply it to the detailed targeting that you enter on cold audiences. Cool. Thank you. Other questions? Anybody? Yeah, Jeremy, I'll ask one. So I've implemented the pre-call hammer them a couple of three, four days ago. So I'm doing four emails a day. And on my breakout page, I have a total of eight videos, right? How many podcasts we're going to get you on? How do I know they're going to be the right ones, et cetera. So obviously those should be emails in themselves. But other than that, I've added like case studies and just a bunch of other what I would perceive to be value-dense emails. But. I asked this at the mastermind too, when we think of the word 'value-dense,' what are we really trying to communicate in those emails besides, you know, like my eight breakout videos that I have turned into email. Does that make sense? I want to make sure I'm answering. Any additional questions that come up on those sales calls that you want answered, those are considered value-dense. Case studies are absolutely examples of what can be value-dense. Okay. Expectations, pretty much the four quadrants of the hammer that I'm like. Question. Second layer questions, expectations, and objections. Those are the main things. Gotcha. All right. That's my question. Thank you. Very good. Other questions? Can you just scroll just back up to the Apple Notes, Jeremy, just one sec, to where the landing page? That bit, yeah. Confirmation page. Yeah, that one. That's the confirmation page, right? With the breakout videos, testimonies. Yeah, got it. It's the confirmation page, correct. Yeah, got it. Cheers. Other questions? All right, great. Love doing this call. As I mentioned throughout the call many times over, there is in-depth training on many of these things individually. I wanted to use this specific call as an opportunity to create one specific. You know, concentrated video of all the best practices, together with some like-too-long, didn't-read tips on each one of them. That way, you guys have a place to consume it more efficiently, rather than having to consume, you know, many hours over of all these things individually. If you choose to, at this point, consume the other ones that I've just talked about for individual questions you have on these steps, I think that's beneficial at this point. So again, weekly group call, library, mastermind talks library, SOPs, that's where you get much more dense and granular information on each one of these things individually that we've talked about throughout this call. Thank you all for being here. It's been an absolute pleasure. Talk soon. Go get richer. Peace.
