Transcrição Completa: 85 Content That Aids the Sales Process 7 6 24
[00:00] Sweet. Welcome in to the uh weekly group call. Today we are going to talk uh our topic that we are going to cover is uh what type of content you should be making to aid the sales process.
[00:15] We're going to go through it video by video and we're going to break down what specifically you need to be creating, what you might be able to pull from what you've already got. And I'm just going to help you ideulate on once again content that aids the sales process.
[00:30] Uh just to give you some backtrack information on this so you understand where I'm coming from. First of all, uh, way back in the day, talking like 11 years ago at this point, working for Grant Cardone, guy's an absolute content machine.
[00:45] I go into Facebook ads manager and I realized that you can retarget people based on the threshold of content that they consumed. And in my head, that clicked immediately because I was doing a lot of email marketing sequences at the time.
[01:00] Email marketing sequences being if this then that logic. So, you know, if somebody took a specific contextual action, I can then retarget them with a specific email that talks based on what they did or what they did not do.
[01:15] That made a lot of sense for me when I went into the ads manager and I saw that you could retarget people with the same exact logic. If they watch this, then they should see that. If they didn't watch this, then they should see something else.
[01:30] So, I started creating content sequences. And as almost all of you know, I've originated a little over, I think, eight different content ad strategies now over the years, and they all work exceptionally well.
[01:45] They all have different purposes. Uh, allow me to break down the most recent strategy that I want you guys to understand I'm using that I think in my opinion is probably the best one I've ever created, which is the tornado ad strategy.
[02:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Tornado Ad Strategy - Content Cycle Bin"
NÚMEROS: 8+ estratégias criadas ao longo dos anos
VISUAL: Conceito de funil de conteúdo em formato de tornado, representando ciclo de conteúdo não-linear vs sequências lineares tradicionais
[02:15] Historically, some of my strategies have had specific sequences to them. Meaning, I want to ensure that people watch a specific video before they can watch a next specific video. A sequence in a literal form versus the tornado is much more of what we refer to as a content cycle bin.
[02:30] The content cycle bin meaning I don't really care what specific piece of content they consume in what order. I more so just want to ensure that there is the specific types of content that I want them consuming available to them to consume when they want.
[02:45] And once they consume it, I want to ensure they never see that piece of content again and they get targeted by a different piece of content.
[03:00] So the way I'm going to break down this set of lessons to you in this specific video is is based on the logic that once again we're using a content cycle bin and we want to ensure that people are seeing any number of these pieces of content, not necessarily in any one particular order.

NÚMEROS: Priorização do topo para baixo
VISUAL: Lista hierárquica mostrando categorias de conteúdo ordenadas por impacto e importância, seta descendente indicando ordem de criação
[03:30] So, to be clear, video by video, allow me to break down for you ideally what we want to be doing. Um, to be clear, there are a few things that I want you to understand and what I'm going to say, and I'm going to order these, I think, an importance of of what you need to create.
[03:45] There is a lot of you who already have a lot of this content. There are some of you here who, you know, you don't have any of this content. You're going to need to create it. And to be clear, creating content can be a pain in the ass.
[04:00] Um, especially given that you're going to need to be like very specific about what you create. So, let me just stress the fact that I'm going to try to order these in terms of how I articulate them to you today by importance and impact.
[04:15] Meaning, what what is here at the top is going to have the highest impact. And then as we move down the list, I don't want to minimize or make it sound like the things that are lower on the list should not be done.
[04:30] But if you're going to prioritize any particular set of videos that you should create, I want you to start at the top of the list and then work your way down in terms of uh importance and impact. Okay.

[05:00] So, number one, uh flex content. Now, this you might think right away is just, you know, surface level like you're standing in front of cars, you know, you're hard flexing on people. Um you you know, you're like showing watches or like, you know, dumbass shit like that. And that that is actually not the case at all.
[05:15] So when I talk about flex content, um I want to be very direct in saying this is living in the result that whatever you're selling gets people.

[05:45] So as an example, let's use what James was just talking about with us where he helps people overcome alcohol, okay, and drinking and just cutting out alcohol in their life. Well, living in the result, you know, James always makes these claims, as does anybody who helps people stop drinking alcohol, that there's all kind of all kinds of like specific health benefits.
[06:00] that there's like mental clarity that comes along with not drinking alcohol. Um, that there's like more vigor and energy that you get as a result of not drinking alcohol. I mean, those are some of the most common claims.
[06:15] Think about some of the other ones that come to mind when you think of people who tell you, "Hey, don't drink." You know, like you're going to experience this type of result and this type of result. It would be very wise, you know, for James to demonstrate that these are actually true.
[06:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Case Study: Brian Johnson - Reversão de Idade"
NÚMEROS: 20+ anos (idade do filho), 40-50 anos (idade de Brian)
VISUAL: Comparação visual de envelhecimento, transformação capilar (cinza para preto), físico atlético, resultados de testes médicos
[06:45] You know, as an example, think of the guy named Brian Johnson. Brian Johnson's a guy who's trying to live forever. He's trying he's he's trying not to die, okay? And when you think of this guy's content, a lot of what he does is he puts on display the things that he's actually going out there doing.
[07:00] He recently did a genetic editing of his own DNA out in uh I think it was the Bahamas or one of the Caribbean islands is where he went and got this done. It's obviously not FDA approved for him to go outside of the country.
[07:15] I'm sure that it was either illegal inside of the United States or just something that would get people in trouble if they did it here. And he went and did this genetic editing test and he edited his genes as a result of this.
[07:30] Now, to be clear, it was really interesting how he talked about this. Okay, so in this specific video, he breaks down what editing his genes is going to do. He also breaks down why it's dangerous.
[07:45] He then breaks down that this specific place that he went to embedded a kill switch where he could take a specific antioxidant and that would undo this entire thing that he was, you know, essentially testing on himself.
[08:00] He also articulated the result of it is ideally some additional muscle strength, some some reversal in joint damage and there were some other like nuance things that he talked about in terms of the result that he was going to generate.
[08:15] Now, that type of content that was like explanatory content that was content where, you know, he's articulating what he's doing. That's not really flexing the result. That's not really living in the result. He's like filming that at a hospital, you know, at this office like while he's doing the test.
[08:30] However, most of this guy's content that he mixes in with that type of content is living in the result. He'll openly show himself right next to like his 20some year old son. And honestly, as time continues to pass, they do look closer and closer in age.
[08:45] And not because the 20some year old son is looking older, but because Brian in his late 40s, early 50s is looking younger. You know, Brian's hair color has changed tremendously over the years from like gray to a dark black, almost like a very, very dark brown if it is brown.
[09:00] His physique, I mean, the guy's fucking jacked, you know? He's physically fit. He's vegan to be clear, and he talks a lot about that in his content, but I mean, this guy, this guy essentially, he's mastered this art of what we call living in the result flex content.
[09:15] About half of what you see Brian Johnson do is demonstrating the literal results. He posts the results of his tests. He post he he is one of the most I would say I would say measured humans on earth currently in terms of the amount of testing that he does on his own body.
[09:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Flex Content - Info Products & Marcas Pessoais"

[09:45] to determine whether the things that he's doing in all of these random things that he partakes in to reverse his age or slow his age are working or not. Now, showing the measurable results is one thing, but once again, that's not really what people care about when they want to reverse their age or slow their age.
[10:00] You know, they want to show once again that the person's living in youth, right? So, that's the best thing that Brian does alongside of just demonstrating what he's doing in real time. It's actually showing that he's living in the result.
[10:15] A lot of the times when it comes to information product brands that make money, you know, you you're obviously going to see a lot of people like, you know, take myself as an example. It's like buying the Rolls-Royce or, you know, two Ferraris or like big houses, you know, or like watches.
[10:30] and just, you know, freedom to like travel or like the way I get to travel, you know, or like uh where I sit when I go to sports games, you know, or just using new technology because I can afford it and it doesn't really make any kind of impact on me.
[10:45] Uh demonstrating that, you know, once again, people actually get results with what I'm talking about as well, you know. So, you guys out there getting results with the things that I teach and talks about this. This is living a result of what I teach.
[11:00] I teach people how to start and scale marketing agencies. I teach people dig digital marketing lessons. I've taught a tremendous amount of just general business lessons. All of which result in what? Making people money. That's the result.
[11:15] Well, what does that really look like though? Well, I mean, to be clear, when you make more money, how is that visually put on display? That's right. With everything I just articulated.
[11:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Case Study: Tom Cruz - Section 8 Real Estate"

VISUAL: Demonstração de lifestyle de alto padrão alinhado com ensino de investimento imobiliário, múltiplos ativos de luxo
[11:45] So to be clear when you look at your brand and you think to yourself, okay, what is the actual result that I am selling to people, you know, and how can I demonstrate that I'm living in the result? What can I put on display?
[12:00] And like I said, one of the best examples that you can go look at is Brian Johnson in terms of his content that he currently puts out there. It does such a tremendous job at this exact example, but in a really like niche way.
[12:15] You know, the easiest ones to go look at are examples I would say Tom Cruz. So Tom's a personal brand who teaches people section 8 real estate investing. More than three4s of his content success successfully mix in, hey, this is what I do to make money. I invest in section 8.
[12:30] And then it's him like hard flexing, you know, having a $23,000 a month car payment on the new Rolls-Royce Spectre and comfortably affording it. Uh Tom flexing his electric bill that costs $20,000 a month, you know, and comfortably affording it.
[12:45] Uh Tom flexing his multi-million dollar home that he pays $100,000 a month mortgage on, you know. Uh Tom's yacht in the backyard, it cost $5 million. Tom at one point had two yachts.
[13:00] You know, my point being Tom does an incredible job as a personal brand flexing the I'm living in the result type content. Okay? Now, you don't need to look like a dick when you do this.
[13:15] Obviously, that's why I recommend going going and looking at Brian Johnson specifically. When you're an info product type, personal brand, and you're teaching people to make money, this is where Tom Cruz comes in.
[13:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Flex Content: O QUÊ e COMO do Resultado"
NÚMEROS: Não especificado diretamente
VISUAL: Duas categorias principais - demonstração do resultado (O QUÊ) e demonstração do processo (COMO), dashboards, métricas, ferramentas
[13:45] And there's all types of examples of this, of course, outside of just the personal branding category that you can use and that you can leverage and that you could look up. Um, it's important to note flex content is also in its in its finest form not only living in the result but actually demonstrating that you're getting a result.
[14:00] Okay. Now to be clear this this can be the how but it can also be the what in terms of result. Now let me give you an example. So Drew on the call he teaches people how to sell on Amazon and he teaches a very specific demographic.
[14:15] He likes to teach people that make less money than him on Amazon how to get to the point where he's at financially selling on Amazon. He typically doesn't like to sell to people who make more than him, which makes sense.
[14:30] Now, to be clear, Drew could benefit obviously from doing the living in the result content, but in addition to that, he could demonstrate like this is where this is where these Amazon info product personal brands or like in some instances the automation brands inside of this space, they will do a computer style video.
[14:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Demonstração Amazon - Dashboard & Ferramentas"
NÚMEROS: $30,000/mês (vendas de lâmpadas na página 20), página 20 de resultados
VISUAL: Amazon Seller Dashboard, Jungle Scout analytics, refresh de página para autenticidade, métricas de lucro líquido, FBA, inventário
[15:00] Well, they'll sit down, they'll open up their Amazon dashboard, and they'll walk through like things that they're selling that are working well. They'll walk through the results of their store, you know, they'll showcase the Amazon seller dashboard, their historical results that they'll generate.
[15:15] They'll do things like refresh the page, you know, so it doesn't look like they edited anything on the page with HTML and that it's all real. In addition to that, they can go on Amazon.com with tools like Jungle Scout.
[15:30] Jungle Scout is a tool that kind of transparently shows the analytics of different stores and brands and products on Amazon.com. And he could showcase, as an example, on page 20 when you search the word lamp that somebody on all the way down on page 20 is making like $30,000 a month selling lamps on Amazon.
[15:45] It it demonstrates with Jungle Scout the net profit of these brands, whether they're using FBA or not, how much inventory they have on hand. You know, simply put, this just demonstrates, okay, the how of the result and the what the result is.
[16:00] Okay, these two different categories, the how the result is happening and the what of the result. Okay, so for me, as an example, I constantly teach revshares. It's a huge thing that I teach when it comes to the agency side of my education company.
[16:15] which is, okay, well, how do you go about getting a revshare and what does a revshare look like? like what does that type of deal look like? Those two pieces of content are some of my most viewed pieces of content on the agency side of the business.
[16:30] Okay, what and how content in terms of tying it in specifically to results. Okay, it's very important once again that you factor this in. Notice that in both instances I am talking about results when it comes to flex content. You are you are flexing results. You are flexing outcomes.
[16:45] Okay, the main thing that you want to be thinking with here is outcomes. Okay, to be clear, the more that you put this type of content on display, the better off you are. It's very important to understand this drives substantial curiosity.
[17:00] This drives interest. This drives all the important buying related variables of content advertising. Okay, to be clear, unmute yourself if you got a question on this. Drop a question in the chat if you got one. I want to make sure you guys understand this because once again, this is the most important category of content that you can consistently be making.
[17:15] This is what you can benefit from the most.
[17:20] [PERGUNTA DO ALUNO] Would you say that like case studies and testimonials also go in this flex content?
[17:25] So, they're a little more boring and they're not as aligned with the flex content that I'm referring to and how I break this down. I would consider that a category in itself.
[17:35] [ALUNO] Got it.
[17:37] Does that make sense?
[17:38] [ALUNO] Yep.
[17:40] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Alinhamento: Lifestyle vs Receita Real"
NÚMEROS: $300K/ano (lucro Amazon), $700K-900K/mês (Tom Cruz), $1M+/mês (Tom Cruz atual)
VISUAL: Comparação de estilos de vida proporcionais à receita - viagens vs carros de luxo, apartamentos vs mansões, autenticidade vs inflação
[17:42] Yeah. So, I don't have obviously a lot of fancy cars like Tom. I I follow Tom and he obviously uh when he posts his stuff, it's like, man, he's got it all together obviously, right? That's what he appears. So his flex is like there. My flex is like vacations, time freedom.
[18:00] [ALUNO continua] um and I realistically I only probably make like 300k a year on Amazon as it is in profit. So it's like I mean that's pretty decent but that's not you know that's not great. So um but 95% of the population would love to make that. So
[18:15] that's more aligned with the amount you're making anyway. Keep in mind Tom makes a million plus dollars a month. I mean he's constantly and transparently saying I make 700 to 900. I mean the number grows every month to be fair, but like I think his current number is like 7 to 900K a month is what he makes on section 8.
[18:30] So his lifestyle and the type of content that he's living in is is much more aligned with the amount he's making. When you're doing 300k a year, that is the most common thing that you're going to do with your money is you're going to travel.
[18:45] You know, you're going to live in apartment somewhere nice and in probably a major city, but not like the craziest apartment. You're not like flexing pen houses, you know? You're not driving around like Ferraris and like shit $20,000 a month Rolls-Royces. Yeah. So, that makes perfect sense to be clear.
[19:00] [ALUNO] Okay.
[19:01] Is that your question?
[19:03] [ALUNO] Yeah. More my question was is how do I show the flex um outcome of that of only making 300K a year? Again, that's not being super rich, but majority of the population would love to make 300K a year.
[19:15] Yeah, that's right. And to be clear, it's like you got to understand when it comes to living in the result. So, it's it's it's very important to make sure that you transparently talk about that exact number. Okay. And that can be that can be demonstrated in your what/how content and just once again demonstrating the actual financial result that you're getting.
[19:30] When it comes to the living in the result, just make sure it aligns and that it's not inflated because like at a certain point, you know, your education company should outpace your 300k a year by a substantially greater number, you know, and obviously that gives you more financial means to go out there and, you know, hard flex essentially in a bracket that your Amazon store is no longer providing for you.
[19:45] That'd be where you have some misalignment. And believe it or not, that would actually do the opposite of what you're looking for this to do. That would create more skepticism because, you know, people aren't stupid. They they can think to themselves, okay, 300K a year, like what are you really doing with that, right?
[20:00] Traveling, living in a nice place, you know, eating great food, but you're not you're not balling out of control of 300K. You know, you're just living above average in comparison to a normal individual.
[20:15] In addition to that, you might not even have quit your job full-time depending on who you're articulating yourself to and who you're trying to sell to. As an example, let's say you're trying to sell to people who have a well-paying job and you just want them to do this on the side.
[20:30] Then you could also talk about that, you know, where you're saying, "Hey, a lot of my students out there, they'll have a job that already pays them like, you know, 100 200k a year and with some of the free time they have when they're off work, they'll spend a good hour to two hours a week on their Amazon business and they generate an extra, you know, this amount per year."
[20:45] And to be clear, that can be demonstrated in the what/how result. And that way when you're showing the living in the result type content once again that also aligns to the expectations of the what/how content that you put out there. Does that make sense?
[21:00] [ALUNO] Yeah, makes 100% sense.
[21:02] The outcomes outcomes just need to be realistic relative to once again like what the expectations are of the of the revenue you're going to help somebody produce or the result that you're going to help them generate. That's all. Okay. Other questions on this?
[21:15] Okay. Great.

[21:20] So to be clear, next category of content that you want to make sure that you're producing in order to maximize your results with the content. And this is not necessarily a hard category, but it's uh it's pretty broad. This is what we consider expertise content.
[21:35] Okay, expertise content, otherwise known, you could really just call it expert content. This is where you're essentially demonstrating that you actually know what the fuck you're talking about. Okay?
[21:50] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Expert Content - Componentes"
NÚMEROS: Múltiplas categorias listadas
VISUAL: Lista de elementos: case studies, testimonials, podcasts, speaking on stages, associação com plataformas confiáveis
[21:52] Now, this could be where you're doing, as an example, like what Gabe brought up, case studies, uh, you know, testimonials. This is also a pretty broad category because this is where like the podcast content fits in. This is also where like the speaking on stage content fit fits in.
[22:05] And I want to be clear in saying a few of these are actually multi-purpose, meaning you'll find that a few of these pieces of content fit into the following categories as well. Um, to be clear, as an example, one of the following categories will be authority slash credibility.
[22:20] And podcast and speaking on stages can also fall into those same categories to be clear. So when you see those relisted, don't be surprised. Um to be clear, expert content, so case studies, testimonials, podcasts, speaking on stages.

NÚMEROS: 98% (redução no consumo de álcool - estudo Universidade de Washington)
VISUAL: Conceito de transferência de confiança - universidades, instituições, estudos científicos transferindo credibilidade
[22:37] Um to be clear there's a concept that's important to understand which is in itself a category but it is association with trust with trusted slash authoritative platforms or people.
[22:50] So a good example of this, James on the call has a entire study that was done on his program and the reduction in drinking that happens as a result and it's in the what what is it James? The 90th percentile. What what was the number?
[23:05] [JAMES] Reduces drinking by 98%.
[23:08] That's a huge statistic and that came from what was it? The University of Washington.
[23:12] [JAMES] University of Washington.
[23:14] So to be clear, universities as a platform slash like people, they're generally very high trust. So when James gets a study done by a university that is highly trusted, that trust transfers to him and his organization immediately as an example. Okay.

[23:32] Now to be clear, expert content can also be done. Uh this is this is very interesting. I I very rarely remember these people's names. So allow me to just articulate this. Um there is a guy who is a total dumbass.
[23:45] He in every piece of content that he has is speaking with extreme levels of confidence and certainty. Okay? And the things he's talking about to somebody who actually knows what they're doing in life. You look at this guy's content and you're like, "No fucking way, you know, like no fucking way are people listening to this guy."
[24:00] And he has a like a big following, you know? He makes he makes money with his personal brand. Like people buy his products. He doesn't even really have a skill outside of just sounding confident and certain about what he's talking about.
[24:15] And he gets made fun of a lot by smart people who are further along in life. But to people who are not further along in life, this guy sounds like the truth, you know, like this guy sounds like one of the best people you could follow that would help you generate a result.
[24:30] you know, just because confidence and certainty in itself when articulated in content makes you come off like the fucking man, you know, in in regards to whatever you're specifically talking about.
[24:45] If you've ever met somebody in life who's really smart, like they really know what they're doing, they're getting great results in their life, but they just sound soft, they're softspoken, they don't sound very certain, they surely don't sound very confident.
[25:00] You you'd probably articulate them as shy, potentially even insecure. It's harder to trust that person, believe it or not, about what they're saying in comparison to people who come off highly certain and highly confident about how they're articulating themselves around these topics. Right?
[25:15] I could make something up, sound excessively confident and certain about it. And if you don't know yourself about what I'm talking about, you're going to take it as truth because simply put, I'm articulating it from a perspective and I'm articulating it as an individual from a place where once again, I have a lot of confidence and certainty and that in itself transfers into what I'm talking about.

[25:32] So, there's a lot of people that you'll likely see. I'm sure you guys have seen these types of people yourself where you look at what they're talking about and you know what you're talking about. You're like, "What the fuck is this guy saying? There's no way people are listening to this, you know." But they are and they're and they're doing it at a high rate.
[25:45] Believe it or not, a lot of popular personal brands. I I'll give you a great example. I remember back in the day when I was working with Grant, this was when Grant didn't really know a lot about real estate, you know, and this this is just a fact to be clear.
[26:00] This is not like shit-talking Grant by any means. like Grant just was brand new to real estate and investing into large multif family properties. He didn't know some of the most common like real estate investor terms. Um, and that's very fair because he was learning, okay?
[26:15] And he had a real estate guy, the real estate guy's name was Tyler. And Tyler was and you know, and it's the the most fullbodied expert that you can imagine when it came to real estate. Okay? This guy had worked for a huge fund, had done I don't even know how many deals up to that point in the transactional value of his deals.
[26:30] He had raised excessive amounts of capital and Tyler was a really cool guy. He a younger guy probably in his early 30s at the time when I'm working there and you know I befriended Tyler and we'd go to lunch and Tyler was always so frustrated.
[26:45] He was always so so mad and frustrated at that simply put you know Grant would really not know what he was talking about in real estate but he would put out all this content about real estate at the time and like I said it's like 11 plus years ago.
[27:00] Obviously today, Grant has done a tremendous job at, you know, becoming a a true real estate expert and obviously investing billions of dollars alongside of the people in his fund and and the people that he's raised capital from and banks.
[27:15] However, once again, 11 years ago, different kind of Grant when it came to real estate knowledge. And simply put, Tyler would just get so frustrated. But the people who watched Grant talk about real estate, well, they didn't know.
[27:30] I mean, they didn't have the perspective that Tyler had because once again, Grant was talking from a perspective of confidence and certainty because he surely was confidence and certain. He he was very confident. He was very certain.
[27:45] And once again, that transferred into what he does. And obviously that that helped him tremendously through the years at raising capital from these same people who had followed him for that entire duration of time. And Grant up to that point had invested into real estate.

[30:15] And I will have, first of all, a few people tell me I'm a douchebag or I just look like an asshole for sure. But no matter what I'm talking about, when it comes to something that makes money, tell me I'm wrong. there's just got to be a natural, okay, yeah, this guy must know what he's fucking talking about.
[30:30] or this is not his and it's just like all rented or something and this is just the background of his location. There's a lot of trust that immediately transfers just based on where I am. Am I wrong?
[30:45] Versus here I am in my second house. It's like look, I mean, this house isn't bad by any means. You know, it's a great area, but it's a townhouse. It's got a small backyard. It's got a lot of plants and it's only got one parking spot in the front.

[31:15] I mean, there's not a lot of like hard flex type environments that I could put myself in here and talk about money stuff. And I want you to guess, what am I likely to do here?

[44:15] where they'll make a title something along the lines of like uh I I remember this one uh what's his name? Uh Sam Samir, I think was his name. His thumbnail makes it look like it's a video of him explaining like how he got scammed by me.

[45:00] Like that type of content that's like third party proof in this example. um third-party proof. In some in some niches, you have such high quantities of like popularity from you selling in that niche that other people start to just review you.

[45:45] This could also be in some instances platforms like uh Trust Pilot. Um, very rarely nowadays is it is it BBB accreditation and reviews to be fair. In some instances, it's like Google reviews.
[46:00] Um, now this could be done in different ways. It could be done like showcasing, as an example, we have this rating out of five on Trustpilot. One of my buddies, he just started a a business where he is doing air duct cleaning and he already got to 500 five-star reviews.
[46:15] That in itself is an example. They were all Google reviews. He doesn't need to showcase the individual reviews. He can just showcase that he got to 500 fivestar reviews. Um, as an example of of the trust and credibility that he brings.

[46:47] Now, credibility in itself is also a huge variable to consider in this type of content, not just the trust side of things, but once again, what can you do to build credibility into what you're doing?
[47:00] And that's where I say this can mix into a lot of this other stuff. Credibility comes from most of these other instances. Uh, believe it or not, credibility can also just come from consistency in what you're doing, how often you're doing it, how long you've been doing it.
[47:15] Uh, argumentatively, as an example, when I've been teaching people how to get richer for like I've been doing this shit for 10 years now, okay? I've had my education company since 2017. Dude, you can go back literally from day one of my marketing agency. I got to $50,000 in the first 45 days. Okay?
[47:30] My first year we did 550k and that was that was I don't know if that was gross or net. I think that was I think that was net but I believe it or not I actually am not aware anymore. I forget. But regardless I've been rich. Okay. I've been rich. I've gotten richer.
[47:45] and you could literally go back on the entirety of my social media pages and you could scroll all the way back to when I very first got started through today and you could see it for yourself. That's consistency.
[48:00] How many times you guys seen somebody who's teaching people to get rich and then they end up in a fucked up situation themselves a couple months or years later? Did that does that look good? No. Okay. Consistency. Put it on display. Constantly show it. Okay.
[48:15] To be clear, as I mentioned, this mixes in with with a lot of the other stuff that we've talked about. So all of this this this blends with the other content. This blends with the uh with the other categories. It can be done on its own. That's why it's its own category.
[48:30] But a lot of instances, once again, this is just blended. Preferably, you could do both rather than just one or the other. Okay? So it doesn't need to just be one or the other. It can be both. Okay.

[49:00] just out of out of simplicity of the list and I don't want to take up a lot of you guys' time and like I said, a lot of this stuff becomes less and less significant as we move through this.
[49:15] Uh but to be clear, allow me to ensure that you understand this. Um this in itself can be beneficial but not necessary because to be fair, demonstration content is typically some of the least consumed content, but it's appreciated by people that are further down the sales pipeline.
[49:30] And like I said, I'm talking about content that could benefit the sales process. Uh, and I want to make sure you guys use this because once again, specifically to people that are like right on the fence, this becomes beneficial.
[49:45] When you're talking about like top of the funnel stuff, this does not work that well. So further down the sales pipeline, this is beneficial. This becomes critical. Okay.
[50:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Demonstration Content - Exemplo Day in the Life"
NÚMEROS: 2 horas (trabalho focado), $15K/mês (novo retainer), 4 horas (sessão de video pitches)
VISUAL: Descrição de rotina: acordar, café da manhã, 2h de trabalho (reuniões, ad accounts, construção), almoço, sales calls, tempo com família/pets, flexibilidade total
[50:02] I'll give you an example. If somebody's on the fence about starting a marketing agency, okay, and I shoot a actual day in the life video of what it looks like to be an agency owner, okay? It's going to be super dull and boring to a majority of the people that follow me and that watch my content, okay?
[50:15] It's not going to be a highly consumed piece of content. But when I showcase that, you know, I can roll out of bed, do the usual like get ready kind of stuff, you know, eat breakfast, and then I can sit down at a computer and within a good like two hours.
[50:30] I can talk to a bunch of people. I can look at some ad accounts. I could even launch some stuff, you know, or tweak some stuff or build something, talk to some of my staff, you know, fuck off, go get lunch, come back, maybe take some sales calls, take some client calls, you know, take some consulting calls.
[50:45] Um, and I'm doing it all from home, you know. I'm like petting my dogs in between, spending time with my fiance, you know, reading, just know, it's a pretty relaxing looking day. uh boring, but you know, at the end of the day, let's say that one of those sales calls closed and we added like a 15K a month retainer to what we do.
[51:00] and you know, we just did what we normally do in a day as an agency. not going to go very far. But, okay, to the people that are on the fence about starting a marketing agency, they're going to compare their day to that.
[51:15] and they're going to say, "Okay, I got to fucking go to work or even if they get to work from home." Like, dude, they're sitting at the computer all day long. Uh, my fiance, she has this friend, she works for uh what's it called? It's company called Deote and their consulting, their consulting business.
[51:30] Long story short, this girl has to sit there all fucking day. She has to be available. She has to like show her status as available on Microsoft Teams. She has to use Microsoft Teams. She uh has to like take calls whenever the fuck somebody calls her, you know?
[51:45] I could be in the middle of the day and just like go on the golf cart, you know, go get like a smoothie or something, go sit by the water for a little bit, you know? Like I I could really do whatever the fuck I want. I can structure my day however I'd like minus give or take a few recurring calls that are on my schedule. Okay?
[52:00] And that's my point is like to the person who's right there like damn, you know, like that looks a lot fucking cooler than how I'm doing it right now. That's going to that's going to be very impactful for that type of person.
[52:15] But once again, to majority of people, they're just going to skip right past it and they're going to be like, "Ah, you know, that's not really for me. I don't really care about that."
[52:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Demonstration Content - Casos Específicos"
NÚMEROS: 4 horas (demonstração de video pitches)
VISUAL: Exemplos: sessão de 4h de video pitches, follow-ups, processo detalhado, conteúdo técnico para audiência muito específica no fim do funil
[52:32] If I sit down and I showcase what it looks like to just send a fuckload of video pitches, okay, to like make a fuck like let's say like I I sit there and for like four hours I do a demonstration of just four hours worth of video pitches and like valuedriven follow-up in a row.
[52:45] Like yeah, there's going to be some people who really appreciate that content, but it's not going to be the broad part of my audience that appreciates that content. It's going to be a very very very small percentage that says, "Oh, you know, dude, like I can do that for sure. That's how Jeremy gets all his clients like, "Wow, I can do that." No doubt.
[53:00] You see, demonstration content is not even really for everybody. I mean, some of you guys like it might not even be beneficial for you to do demonstration content, okay?
[53:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Demonstration Content - Quando NÃO Funciona"
NÚMEROS: Não especificado
VISUAL: Exemplo de James (parar de beber álcool) - difícil demonstrar "não fazer algo", possível solução: demonstrar socialização sem álcool
[53:17] Because as an example, like I I like to use James' business where he's teaching people to not drink alcohol. It's like, well, how's James going to demonstrate not drinking alcohol? Like going to a party and just drinking like a sparkling water or something, you know? Doesn't make a lot of sense.
[53:30] is not going to be very broad. But at the same time, I mean, to be fair, yeah, there's probably somebody out there thinking, "Well, dude, I like to be social, you know, like I feel like if I cut out drinking, I'm gonna cut out my friends."
[53:45] There could actually be a video of James demonstrating like what it's like to go to a party or something, be social, and not drink and like what it actually looks like, you know? And believe it or not, that might push somebody over the fence who's right on the edge thinking to themselves.
[54:00] "I want to stop drinking, man, but like I don't know. I feel like I'm going to lose my friends. is I'm going to lose my social life if I do. You see what I'm saying? Like that's not going to be broad content, but that's going to be appreciated by somebody who's right there ready to buy. You get what I mean?
[54:15] So, to be clear, this this is this is not going to be your best content, okay? It's it's not going to be highly consumed. This is usually content that you're going to create for a very specific content sequence that is for like getting people to show up to something like a call or a webinar or like something like this.
[54:30] It is once again just in itself used for the end stages of the pipeline. Okay. And it's and it's usually to be clear meant to push people over the edge.
[54:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "CATEGORIA #6: OBJECTION HANDLING (Tratamento de Objeções)"
NÚMEROS: Categoria #6, última categoria, baixo consumo mas crítica para conversão
VISUAL: Sexta e última categoria, conteúdo para fim do funil, preparação para vendas
[54:47] Same thing with this last category. And this is objection handling. Okay, objection handling is also not going to be your most viewed pieces of content, but this is going to come in handy for the sales process.
[55:00] This is content where you are where you are framing for your sales process. Okay, you are handling objections before they come up. You're talking people, you're talking people through what issues they're likely going to have that hold them back from buying.
[55:15] Um, you're essentially handling the things that your saleseople are going to have to talk to them about or that are going to hold them back from buying when and if they show up on a webinar.
[55:30] All these things become very important, but same kind of thing. They are they are not going to be highly consumed at all in any way, shape or form when it comes to, you know, all your content is very broad in comparison. Okay?
[55:45] And that's what's important to note. It's not it's not going to go far, but it's going to do good. It's going to do good with the people that are right on the edge. It's going to do good for the people that are about to get on a sales call. It's going to do good for the people that are going to show up for a webinar. Okay?
[56:00] It's going to do good for the people that are about to DM with your setters. It's not going to do good with the majority of your audience, but but it's not for them. This is one of those videos that you post that you run an engagement campaign on towards a very defined audience of people that are right there in that specific pocket. Okay.
[56:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Resumo: Categorias de Conteúdo por Estágio do Funil"
NÚMEROS: 6 categorias totais, 3 principais para topo de funil, 3 para fim de funil
VISUAL: Divisão clara: INICIAÇÃO (Flex, Expert, Being Character) vs FIM DO FUNIL (Trust/Credibility, Demonstration, Objection Handling)
[56:17] Objection handling content, simply put, and demonstration content critical for the sales process, not critical for the for the, you know, once again, overall reach and the the credibility and the initiation of the sales process.
[56:30] Flex content, expert content, being the character content. These I'd consider what what we call like the initiation type content. This is what bring people into the game. Okay? This is what makes them trust you. This is what makes them consider that they could do whatever it is that you're trying to sell them on doing.
[56:45] This type of content is what sells them on doing it when they are already interested. You guys get the differences there.
[57:00] Okay, cool. Questions on any of this? Feel free to unmute yourself and ask away. Want to make sure you guys understand all this. Drop any questions in the chat if you guys got them and can't talk. Anybody?
[57:15] [ALUNO] So, this is part of the tornado, Jeremy, and we just smashed them with uh with this between them booking a sales call and um the time they get on the call. Yeah.
[57:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Tornado Ad Strategy - Estrutura Completa"
NÚMEROS: 2 estágios principais do tornado
VISUAL: Funil tornado dividido: Content Cycle Bin (topo - categorias 1-3) + Fim do Pipeline (categorias 4-6), retargeting entre call booking e call
[57:32] So, that content specifically would be really good with objection handling, uh with framing. You could even pepper in some of the trust and credibility content into that very specific part of the process.
[57:45] Yes, this part would be the content cycle bin for the tornado as an example where you are bringing people into the game in the first place. Does that make sense?
[57:55] [ALUNO] Yeah.
[57:57] So trust demonstrating objection handling. This is all good for that further down the sales pipeline process. These are good for the bring them into the sales process.
[58:10] [ALUNO] Gotcha. So to clarify, tornado is like four through six. Basically,
[58:15] the tornado encompasses all of this. There's just different stages of the tornado that we're talking about here. So, moral of the story, just remember, trust, credibility, demonstration, objection handling, further down the sales pipeline.
[58:30] the being the character, expert content, flex content, those are all in the content cycle bin at the beginning part of the process that just bring people in and help frame them to get them into your sales process. Does that make sense? different. There's different stages of the tornado. Cool. Other questions?
[58:45] [ALUNO] Quick question, Jeremy. Um, it's I know it's it's good to have like a mix of these things, but what would you say is kind of like the bread and butter foundation of of content between all of these?
[59:00] I'd say these first two have the most impact and make the biggest difference to the success of of content in the flex flex content and expert content.
[59:12] [ALUNO] Correct.
[59:13] Yeah. Flex content especially when it comes to the uh living in the result content and really just once again putting out there the what and the how content uh talking in outcomes and then the expert content just framing yourself as I know what I'm talking about.
[59:30] You can see that I know what I'm talking about and once again you can trust the fact that I can help you.
[59:40] [ALUNO] Thank you.
[59:42] No problem. Other questions?
