Transcrição Completa: Challenge Funnel Mastery 5 3 25
[00:00] All right, cool. Welcome in everybody. So, what we're going to be doing on this week's weekly group call is going through challenge funnel mastery. Challenges are awesome. Sometimes you could frame them as virtual events. Sometimes you could frame them as an actual challenge.
[00:15] What we're referring to when we talk about this model, just so we're on the same page from a vocabulary perspective, is generally somewhere between like a two and three-day live event. These are obviously virtually hosted. They're not done physically in person. Generally executed over Zoom.
[00:30] Most of the time they have some type of outcome associated to them. So the whole concept of a challenge funnel was to help people that you're selling to start the process and get into the game with whatever you're trying to sell them to do and start.
[00:45] So as an example of this, we are going to go through an example here today from one of my top clients that just did a $4 million challenge, 3.4-4 mil from the challenge itself and about 600k in ticket sales.
[01:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Challenge Funnel Revenue Timeline"

[01:30] Through that challenge, she was able to get people started with what she actually sells as an outcome. So, she teaches people how to buy businesses. So the whole point of the challenge was to get people to start the process of buying a business.
[01:45] Which in this case, as an example of this, could be learning how to find the businesses to buy, learning how to negotiate with the businesses, learning about leverage and being able to strategically work your way into a business with little money out of pocket.
[02:00] By the end of this challenge that she did, she had people building lists of businesses, scripting and contacting these businesses and like literally starting the process of trying to buy them.

NÚMEROS: 2 month promotion window, 1.5 months minimum
VISUAL: Gráfico comparativo mostrando webinars como pequenos spikes repetitivos vs challenge como um grande lumpsum único. Eixo de tempo mostrando janela de promoção de 2 meses com período de burn inicial.
[02:30] The same thing goes for pretty much every challenge. Every challenge ideally has a theme with an outcome associated with it that gets people started in whatever it is that you're going to try to sell people on doing. That's the whole point of them.
[02:45] Most of the time they're paid rather than free. And again, in this video here today, we're going to be going through just all the best practices from a mastery perspective on challenges.
[03:00] So yeah, without further ado, let's get started. Excited to help you guys out with this. This is generally a big money maker. Let's get started with a very simple concept now that we're on the same page about what a challenge is.
[03:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Challenge Revenue Timeline"
NÚMEROS: 2 months promotion, 1.5 months minimum
VISUAL: Gráfico com eixo de dólares vs tempo. Mostra período de burn (linha descendente) durante promoção, seguido por spike massivo de receita no evento. Comparação visual entre pequenos lumpsums de webinars vs grande lumpsum de challenge.
[03:45] If we have dollars and time, what ends up happening is you have a pretty significant burn window where you have ad dollars going out in order to promote the challenge where you're obviously making no dollars during that duration of time.
[04:00] This window is generally about a two-month promotion time span. Sometimes it's about one and a half months in terms of the total period of time that we ideally want to promote a challenge.
[04:15] There's a few key reasons why we need this amount of time. The main thing is challenges are big. The whole point of a challenge is to make a fuckload of money.
[04:30] If we look at webinars as an example, webinars create like little lumpsums. They create little spikes. And those little spikes, although yeah, they're great, they're like that's all they are. They're just little lumpsums.
[04:45] Even if you do a huge webinar once a month, they still generally don't come remotely close to the revenue potential of what a challenge can produce comparatively.
[05:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Promotion Timeline Requirements"
NÚMEROS: 2 months ideal, 1.5 months minimum, 3 months for live events, 2 weeks for fixes
VISUAL: Timeline horizontal mostrando diferentes períodos de promoção. Marcadores para eventos live (3 meses), challenges virtuais (2 meses), e janela mínima (1.5 meses). Indicação visual de "margin for error" com espaço destacado.
[05:30] Due to the fact that it's such a significant revenue event, and it's like a true lumpsum that we're trying to generate off of doing a challenge, we have to promote it for a much longer duration of time, just like we would any normal live in-person event.
[05:45] Most of the time for a live in-person event, you're seeing promotion timelines as far out as like 3 months. So for a virtual event, in this case a challenge, two months is very appropriate. A month and a half at a minimum is what I would recommend.
[06:00] The reason that you want to have that amount of time is so you give yourself some margin for error. You have to have room for margin of error. Some of your ads might not work the best.
[06:15] One of my examples here in the inner circle was one of our members named Euan. Euan has done two challenges since I've started talking about challenges a few months back and the first challenge, he was like a week and a half into promoting it and he was getting a dog shit conversion rate.
[06:30] His cost per purchase was really high. Nothing was really going his way. He shot me over the page. I gave him a lot of really constructive criticism on what he could do to fix everything. He fixed it, took about another few days just to get everything turned around.
[06:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Margin for Error Case Study"
NÚMEROS: 2 weeks fixing period, 3:1 ROAS achieved, 1.5 weeks initial failure
VISUAL: Timeline mostrando primeira semana e meia com performance ruim (linha vermelha descendente), período de correção (área amarela), depois linha verde ascendente mostrando 3:1 ROAS. Ícones de ferramentas de otimização.
[07:00] And then bang, he started getting three to one rows on the front end for his cost per purchase for the challenge funnel, which is great. But think about that. That's about two weeks of time out of the entire promotion cycle that just went towards failing and then fixing stuff.
[07:15] You have to have that margin for error with a challenge because it's not just like a clean amount of money that you're going to get off every day. There's going to be periods of time throughout that promotion cycle that have like a little less dollars at the beginning.
[07:30] And a much much higher quantity of ad dollars going out when you officially get things cracking. Now, obviously the point of the challenge is to create a significant revenue event. We're trying to produce lumpsums with the challenge.
[07:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Case Study: $4M Challenge Breakdown"
NÚMEROS: $10K product, $2K deposit, $292K ad spend, 1.9x ROAS, $100-$200 AOV, 6,000+ buyers, 70% show rate, 2 months promotion
VISUAL: Infográfico detalhado com múltiplas seções: círculo mostrando estrutura de preço ($2K + $8K), barra de ad spend, medidor de ROAS, gráfico de AOV variável, contador de compradores, medidor de show rate com 70% destacado.
[08:15] Give or take how many people you get to show up to the challenge. Give or take how many people you obviously get to buy in the first place. Give or take the price of what you sell and your offers obviously dictates the revenue potential.
[08:30] But let me be extremely clear when I say this. In the challenge case study that I'm going to show you guys the landing page for and show you guys some of the ads for, we had a $10,000 product.
[08:45] We had a $2,000 deposit that we required people to buy during the challenge itself in order to secure their spot. They did a phone call to cash collect the other 8K.
[09:00] We had about $292,000 in ad spend that had gone out. We had a 1.9x ROAS on the frontend ticket sales. We had an AOV with a few different upsells worked into the challenge funnel price of give or take the time frame as low as about $100 and as high as just shy of $200.
[09:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Challenge Performance Metrics"
NÚMEROS: 6,000+ purchases, 70% show rate, 3-day event, 63-64% pitch attendance
VISUAL: Dashboard style com múltiplos medidores: contador digital de compradores (6K+), medidor circular de show rate (70%), calendário mostrando 3 dias, gráfico de retenção dia-a-dia mostrando declínio de 70% para 60s para 50s.
[09:45] It's also very important to note this challenge was promoted over that duration of about two months. And we had some margin for error there where we had to fix things too. But here's the thing. We had just above 6,000 people purchase.
[10:00] We had a 70% show rate because we did a paid challenge, not a free challenge. And we had phenomenal retention throughout the 3-day event.
[10:15] There's a few key statistics that I'm going to make sure I want you to understand throughout all of this. First question that needs resolved: Is it paid or should it be done for free?
[10:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Paid vs Free Challenges"
NÚMEROS: 70% paid show rate vs 10-20% free show rate, $79-$99 early bird pricing
VISUAL: Comparação lado a lado com duas colunas. Lado "PAID" em verde com check marks: higher show rate (70%), liquidates ad spend, better quality. Lado "FREE" em vermelho com X: poor show rate (10-20%), no revenue offset, lower commitment.
[10:45] I am a big fan of paid. I am not a fan of doing free challenges. And it's very simple why. You get a much higher show rate when people buy and you can liquidate the ad dollars on the front end if you can manage to get profitable.
[11:00] Or you can at least liquidate some of the burn that you're going to otherwise have promoting this thing by having a paid challenge. Now, most of the time the question then becomes, well, what's the price?
[11:15] We like to have anywhere between like a $79 and a $99 price. And it's very important to note we frame this as early bird pricing. We try to maintain early bird pricing until about a week out from the start of the event.
[11:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Pricing Timeline Strategy"
NÚMEROS: Week 1-4: $79 true early bird, Week 5-7: $99 extended early bird, Week 8: $140-$395 final pricing
VISUAL: Timeline horizontal de 8 semanas com 3 zonas de cores diferentes. Zona 1 (verde): "True Early Bird $79" - 4 semanas. Zona 2 (amarela): "Extended Early Bird $99" - 3 semanas. Zona 3 (vermelha): "Punish Price $140-$395" - 1 semana. Setas indicando incrementos de preço.
[12:00] Very important to take note that this makes a big difference. This was an example of one of the rooms for margin of error that we figured out with this promotion of this $4 million challenge.
[12:15] We got the majority of our ticket sales when we were doing this $79 to $99 early bird pricing. And then we got rid of the early bird pricing and we saw ticket sales just drop off a cliff and that was a known known.
[12:30] However, we didn't come close to our ticket goal at the time that we had gotten rid of the early bird pricing. So, we ended up having to do what we called an extended early bird pricing.
[12:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "2-Month Promotion Cycle Breakdown"
NÚMEROS: 6 challenges per year possible, 7 weeks early bird total, Month 1: true early bird, Weeks 5-7: extended, Week 8: punishment pricing
VISUAL: Calendário anual mostrando 6 blocos de 2 meses cada. Zoom em um bloco de 2 meses dividido em segmentos: grande seção verde (4 semanas), seção amarela média (3 semanas), pequena seção vermelha (1 semana). Ícones de timer e preço em cada seção.
[13:15] Let me be really clear on this whole two-month timeline with you guys. If you gave yourself two months to promote a challenge, that would give you the opportunity to do six challenges a year.
[13:30] And that is honestly a lot. It's going to feel like a lot. These things take a lot out of you. Not easy to do. I'm not framing them as easy to do. A lot of time and effort to pull off a challenge.
[13:45] But again, it's one of the largest lumpsum things that we could do as brands right now. So on that two-month cycle, if we have all the way over here where the challenge actually starts, we have over here the promotion starting.
[14:00] I want early bird pricing to go until about one week out. This is when I want my early bird to end. So here early bird ends. Now from that perspective we therefore have a full seven weeks essentially of early bird pricing.
[14:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "True vs Extended Early Bird Strategy"
NÚMEROS: $79 true early bird (Month 1), $99 extended early bird (3 weeks), $20 lift, $140 standard final, $395 VIP final
VISUAL: Escada ascendente de preços com 3 degraus principais. Degrau 1 (largo): "$79 TRUE EARLY BIRD" - 4 semanas. Degrau 2 (médio): "$99 EXTENDED +$20" - 3 semanas. Degrau 3 (estreito): "$140-$395 PUNISHMENT" - 1 semana. Timers visuais em cada degrau.
[14:45] So we have the true early bird cost all the way for the first month at least. So, the whole first month of this thing, we're doing the true early bird pricing. And this might be, as an example, like your $79 price or your $89 price.
[15:00] Now, in this next window that we have between the one month and the one week out, this is what we're going to call the extended early bird pricing. This is slightly higher than the true early bird pricing, but it's still considered early bird pricing.
[15:15] This is what really saved the day for us on getting a substantial amount of additional ticket sales and also increased our AOV a little bit. The true early bird pricing is what's going to incentivize people to buy early. It needs to be an actual deal.
[15:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Final Week Punishment Pricing"
NÚMEROS: $79→$140 general admission (+$61), $99→$395 VIP (+$296), Week 8 only, incremental bumps
VISUAL: Gráfico de barras comparativas mostrando saltos de preço dramáticos. Barra vermelha pequena ($79) vs barra vermelha grande ($140) para GA. Barra azul pequena ($99) vs barra azul gigante ($395) para VIP. Seta ascendente agressiva entre elas com texto "PUNISH".
[15:45] And I would obviously encourage that you use timers for this. The extended early bird pricing starts about one month out until about three weeks. So three weeks of promotion for the extended early bird pricing. This might take the ticket sale as an example from 79 to 99. About a $20 lift.
[16:00] Now for that last week, this is very important. We want to punish the people who didn't take action yet. This little window here, this is where we punish the people who didn't take action. This is where you end up having the true price.
[16:15] True price for us ended up in this particular instance being about $140 for the regular general admission and then we bumped it all the way up to about $395 for the VIP. We ended up getting the standard ticket price up to about 194 towards the tail end of this thing.
[16:30] We had the VIP all the way up to about 394. So, in that final week, we just continued to incrementally bump up the price. This is the promotion timeline in terms of how it looks with the pricing specifically that you're going to do.
[16:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "KPI Targets: Break Even to Profitable"
NÚMEROS: 1.9x ROAS achieved, $100-$200 AOV range, 3 OTOs, Break even minimum, 2x+ ambitious
VISUAL: Termômetro de performance com 3 zonas: zona vermelha inferior "CONSERVATIVE: Lose Money", zona amarela média "MODERATE: Break Even", zona verde superior "AMBITIOUS: Profitable 2x+". Marcador atual em 1.9x na zona verde.
[17:00] Remember, it should always be a paid challenge. Let's go through some of these KPIs that you have to have. So, ideally, you want to break even. In terms of ad dollars, the best case scenario is obviously being profitable, but at the least we want to break even.
[17:15] Shoot for profitability. Profit comes from increasing AOV. So a major key in terms of a lesson that was learned through the most recent promotion of all these challenges is the ticket is just the front door price.
[17:30] Then from there we ideally have a few different OTOs. For us we ended up having three OTOs and then we ended up also ending it with a call scheduling option like a standard application funnel at the end of this whole thing.
[17:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "OTO Structure & AOV Strategy"
NÚMEROS: OTO 1: $100, OTO 2: $150, OTO 3: $399, Final: Free call booking, AOV: $100-$200 range
VISUAL: Funil vertical com 5 níveis. Topo: "TICKET $79-99" (porta de entrada). Nível 2: "OTO 1: $100". Nível 3: "OTO 2: $150". Nível 4: "OTO 3: $399". Base: "CALL BOOKING (Free)". Setas conectando cada nível, AOV total destacado ao lado.
[18:00] I'm going to be honest with you guys, I didn't even track the revenue that came prematurely from the call scheduling on this event. I have no idea the amount of revenue that the call scheduling step drove. I know that it drove some calls, but they're technically free and clear calls.
[18:15] We had a few OTOs. The first OTO was 100 bucks. Second OTO was 150. Third OTO, we put at 3.99. And then obviously this last one was just a free call booking that we attempted to do upselling our 10K product that we had.
[18:30] Our total AOV, give or take the time frame here, averaged out somewhere between $100 and all the way up to just shy of about 200. We ended up with a front end profit of a 1.9.
[18:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Profitability Expectations Spectrum"
NÚMEROS: Conservative: Lose money, Moderate: Break even, Ambitious: 2x+ profitable, Achieved: 1.9x
VISUAL: Espectro horizontal com 3 zonas de cores. Esquerda (vermelho escuro): "CONSERVATIVE - Burn Cash". Centro (amarelo): "MODERATE - Break Even". Direita (verde brilhante): "AMBITIOUS - 2x+ Profit". Marcador/pin em 1.9x na zona verde.
[19:00] Now, I do want to be fair and saying for this specific funnel that we're talking about, this was with Cody Sanchez. A lot of people like to compare themselves to people that they're currently perceptually competing with or view themselves as similar to.
[19:15] A lot of people like to think like, "Oh, well, somebody like Cody, I mean, that's a really big client. That person's like out of reach." We've had clients that are total no names that you've literally never heard of that have had higher profit than this on the front end.
[19:30] I actually think to be fair, we could have been more profitable on the front end on this specific challenge, but there were a few key things that really messed that up. I'll talk about some of those mistakes here briefly.
[19:45] But moral of the story is I genuinely think you can be above a 2:1 profitability on challenges. Although generally the expectation that you want to have is that you're going to break even.
[20:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "AOV Driver: Congruent OTOs"
NÚMEROS: 10-20% first OTO conversion target, Single digits = wrong offer, High single digits minimum
VISUAL: Diagrama de funil mostrando "MAIN THING" no topo (círculo grande com 10 segmentos), setas apontando para 3 OTOs menores abaixo. Cada OTO é uma "fração" do main thing. Barras de conversão ao lado: verde (10-20%), amarelo (high single digits), vermelho (single digits = wrong).
[20:30] That's the most conservative - technically the most conservative expectation you could have is you're technically going to lose money going into the challenge. Back in the day when challenges were created, nobody was really trying to profit on the front end.
[20:45] You'd give it your best shot, but the whole point of a challenge was to burn some dollars upfront, make all the money obviously on the upsell and getting as many people as you can in person.
[21:00] That's how it was originated. And to be honest, it still does phenomenal if that's the case. That's the most conservative expectation you could have is I'm going to lose some dollars on the front end of this whole thing, burn for a good two-month duration of time.
[21:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Main Thing vs Breakout Products"
NÚMEROS: 10 total components, 3-4 covered in challenge, Challenge = 3/10ths of main thing
VISUAL: Círculo grande dividido em 10 fatias iguais representando "THE MAIN THING". Ao lado, círculo menor destacado com 3 fatias preenchidas representando "CHALLENGE". Setas mostrando que OTOs também são frações do círculo principal. Sistema de frações visual (3/10, 2/10, etc).
[21:45] And you have to endure that. I just want to be really clear in the instance that you fall into that most conservative bucket, you have to really be prepared here that you're going to have as long as your promotion cycle is of just burning dollars.
[22:00] So again, ideally, you're profitable. So you're able to cover credit card billing cycles and invoicing that comes from these ad platforms prior to the lumpsum. That way you're actually making money on the front end, too.
[22:15] If you're at a 1.9x profit, on the front end, you're technically making ad dollars too with the ticket sales. That's best case scenario is profit. A mid-case scenario would be that you're break even.
[22:30] Extremely conservative, you're losing money. Moderate, you're break even. Ambitious, you're profitable. The main thing that drives profitability is this right here - if you can get to the point where you jack up your AOV through upsells, you're going to have a good time.
[22:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "OTO Selection Strategy: Fractions of Main Thing"
NÚMEROS: Example: Show rate challenge, 3 components taught, Multiple OTO options available
VISUAL: Diagrama de árvore hierárquica. Topo: "INNER CIRCLE (Main Thing)" com múltiplos ramos: Show Rate, Scaling, CRO, Sales, Ad Strategies, Webinars, Challenges, etc. Destacado: "Show Rate Challenge" conectado a OTOs potenciais: "Content Ad SOPs", "Mastermind Recording", "Ad Scaling Training".
[23:15] Now, one thing that's really important to understand - you typically are in a challenge and whatever the product is that you're going to sell, you have the main thing that your whole product is centered around.
[23:30] The topic that you're teaching people or the topic that you're getting people into the game with. The reason that you're getting people to the challenges is that there's some kind of main thing that you're going to try to get people involved with.
[23:45] Generally your challenge is like a little breakout thing. It's like a specific result that helps people get into the game, but it's not you teaching the main thing. The challenge is just like a breakout product that essentially gets them into the game.
[24:00] Gets them a fraction of what the main thing otherwise is. So consider this from a fraction perspective. If you look at it from a fraction perspective and the main thing is made up of 10 things and you're going to teach all 10 of those things inside of the main thing.
[24:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Show Rate Challenge Example Breakdown"
NÚMEROS: 3 core components: Hammer Them, Confirmation Pages, Email Marketing
VISUAL: Três caixas conectadas horizontalmente representando os componentes do challenge: 1) "HAMMER THEM Strategy" com ícone de martelo, 2) "CONFIRMATION PAGE Best Practices" com ícone de checklist, 3) "VALUE DENSE EMAILS" com ícone de envelope. Abaixo, exemplos de homework: script templates, page mockups, email drafts.
[24:45] The challenge itself might be like three tenths of what the main thing actually is that you're breaking down and teaching. Now, the whole point of what I'm trying to articulate here is the OTOs - the upsells that come after the actual challenge is purchased are also fractions.
[25:00] They're like little breakout products. They are other things that have some congruency and some alignment to whatever the main thing is. I'll give you an example. I'm just going to make up a challenge here for myself.
[25:15] Let's use the example that the main thing that I could teach is like what we do here in the inner circle where you get a full well-rounded perspective on marketing, sales, you get operational insights, too.
[25:30] We talk about show rate a lot. We talk about scaling. We talk about ad dollars being spent efficiently. We talk about conversion rate optimization. We talk about sales. We talk about the best practices of business period with some of the things that work today.
[25:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "OTO Congruency = Higher Conversions"
NÚMEROS: 10-20% first OTO target, Single digits = wrong product, High single digits minimum acceptable
VISUAL: Comparação lado a lado. Lado esquerdo (verde): "CONGRUENT OTOs" - Content Ad SOPs, Mastermind Recording, Scaling Training - barras de conversão em 15-20%. Lado direito (vermelho): "RANDOM OTOs" - produtos não relacionados - barras em 3-5%. Check marks vs X marks.
[26:15] We talk about content ad strategies. We talk about confirmation bench press practices. We talk about webinars, book funnels, challenges, call funnels. Lead forms, all of those are like those individual fractions that I'm talking about here.
[26:30] The main thing would be literally all of them. The example of the breakout challenge - imagine if I did a challenge that was specifically centered around show rate. I could easily teach those three things.
[26:45] I could teach the hammer them strategy. I could teach confirmation page best practices. And I could teach email marketing best practices with valued dense emails. If I just taught those three things, that would get people a phenomenal result in the challenge.
[27:00] For sure it would. And that'd absolutely be worth the dollars that they're going to spend to get into the challenge in the first place. I could have them script out their hammer them content. I could have them script out their breakout videos and what their confirmation page is going to look like.
[27:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Strategic OTO #3: Signal Intent"
NÚMEROS: $15K/day ad spend training example, Lower purchase rate expected, High-intent signal for sales team
VISUAL: Funil com 3 OTOs em sequência. OTO 1 e 2 com barras de conversão normais (verde). OTO 3 destacado em dourado com ícone de flag/sinal: "INTENT SIGNAL" - compradores deste sinalizam estar prontos para high-ticket. Seta conectando a "SALES TEAM PRIORITY".
[27:45] I could provide some of those valued dense emails. Really easy to get people a result for those dollars they're going to spend. Now, the OTOs, right? What is something else that I could easily break off from the main thing that makes sense to upsell if you bought a ticket to a challenge like that?
[28:00] I could easily teach for one of my upsells. Maybe I sell my content ad strategies SOP. I have this thick binder. It's yellow on the cover and it just has three or four of the content ad strategies in them.
[28:15] Like the Venus fly trap, the harvester, the forester. I think the reverse fly trap might be in there as well. It's just a big old SOP list. That makes sense as one of my breakout products that I could easily sell. That'd be an easy OTO.
[28:30] In addition to that, I could upsell. Let's say I've talked at a mastermind before. I have a really good one we put in the pre-training library for master internet marketing. It's a four-part mastermind video from Garrett J. White.
[28:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "OTO Mistake: Random Products"
NÚMEROS: Single digit conversions = wrong OTOs, 10-20% first OTO benchmark, High single digits conservative
VISUAL: Diagrama de erro comum. Topo: "MAIN THING" conectado por linhas quebradas (vermelho) a produtos aleatórios sem relação. Barras de conversão em 2-5% (vermelho). Versus diagrama correto: linhas sólidas (verde) conectando frações relacionadas, conversões 10-20%.
[29:15] Garrett was one of our clients doing 22 mil a year at the time. Invited me to speak at his mastermind and I talked at length about content ad strategies there for about three hours. That'd make a lot of sense as another OTO.
[29:30] It would add credibility and expertise, but it's also just be a layup deal for people to purchase. Again, it has a lot of similarities and congruency to the theme of my main thing because it is a breakout of the main thing.
[29:45] See, that's where a lot of people get wrong about how OTOs work. They just pick a bunch of random ass shit and then they wonder why they have single-digit conversion rates on the OTOs.
[30:00] This is very important to understand. If you have single digits, you have the wrong upsells. Ideally, you're shooting for high single digits on a conservative basis and you're shooting for somewhere between 10 and 20% at least for your first OTO.

NÚMEROS: OTO 1: 10-20% target, OTO 2 & 3: Lower (people don't expect high spend), All should be congruent
VISUAL: Três barras decrescentes representando OTOs sequenciais. OTO 1 (maior, verde): 10-20%. OTO 2 (média, amarela): números menores. OTO 3 (menor, ainda válida): sinal de intent mais importante que conversão. Nota: "Lower take rate = expected, still valuable".
[30:45] I want to be very fair and saying the second OTO and the third OTO, they generally have a slightly lower take rate because people aren't necessarily anticipating coming out of pocket that much.
[31:00] The first OTO is the most important one to judge. That's the one that helps the most with your AOV. The second and the third one, they'll be purchased generally by less people just because they're expecting to come out of pocket for a lot less.
[31:15] But here's the trick. If you have OTOs that have a lot of congruency to the main thing, you should naturally have a lot higher take rate.
[31:30] For my third OTO in that example I provided, I could pick something like I could go into an ad channel and I could say here's how to spend $15,000 a day successfully on ads and I could go through just one of our weekly inner circle group call videos.
[31:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "OTO #3 Strategic Value: Sales Signal"
NÚMEROS: $15K/day ad training example, Signals high-intent buyers, Easier upsells for sales team
VISUAL: Fluxo de processo mostrando: Comprador → OTO 3 ($15K/day training) → FLAG/SIGNAL → Sales Team recebe alerta → "This person is ready for high-ticket". Ícone de sino/alerta destacado. Seta grossa conectando a "EASIER CLOSE".
[32:15] Purchased by less people. But here's the thing that I'm trying to emphasize with this third OTO. This is a great trick. Notice how the third OTO would clearly only be purchased by people who have some type of intention to actually go big with ads.
[32:30] It'd be a great signal for my sales team, wouldn't it? If they called those people ahead of time, if we knew that after the challenge, those people specifically they expressed intent in that type of offer and that type of frame.
[32:45] How much easier would it be to have something that I could sell them just because they signal that they're interested in something at that level? So, here's the other trick with OTOs.
[33:00] You ideally want to pick stuff that when purchased, your sales team can look at it and say, "Dude, if they bought that, there's a lot of other shit I could easily sell that person." You see, there's a lot of other ways I could help them.
[33:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "OTO → Sales Team Feed Strategy"

[33:45] So, OTOs, just like any other low ticket thing out there that you're going to sell, ideally gets fed to the setters or your salespeople in general to call and upsell on.
[34:00] When we have that congruency from taking something from the main thing and selling it as OTO, we have a good time. We're going to have a higher AOV. We're going to increase the ability to sell people and upsell them.
[34:15] Ideally, from this perspective, you have a higher probability to reach more of the ambitious statistics with front-end ticket sales being profitable rather than break even or losing money.
[34:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Show Rate Benchmarks: Paid vs Free"
NÚMEROS: Paid: 70% benchmark, Free: 10-20%, Diminishing by day: Day 1: 70%, Day 2: 60s%, Day 3: 50s%
VISUAL: Dois gráficos de barras lado a lado. Esquerda "PAID CHALLENGE" (verde): barras altas começando em 70% declinando gradualmente. Direita "FREE CHALLENGE" (vermelho): barras baixas 10-20% declinando para 4%. Setas descendentes mostrando padrão de diminuição diária.
[35:00] Now let's talk about show rates real quick. With show rates, when we do a paid challenge, the benchmark should be about 70%. This is really important to understand.
[35:15] If we do a free challenge, show rates a lot worse. I can see just like a normal webinar 10 to 20%. And when it comes to show rate, you see a diminishing show rate each day.
[35:30] So the first day I might get that 70%. The second day I might get somewhere in the 60s. The third day I might get somewhere in the 50s. See a diminishing show rate each day that goes on.
[35:45] If the same logic applies when I do free, those statistics are even worse. Might get 10% that show up the first day, 4% that show up the next day. That's why I don't like doing free challenges.
[36:00] I love doing paid challenges. It really just is about the show rate more than anything else and the fact that we can liquidate some of those dollars.

[36:45] I'm going to take a moment just answer a few questions on what we've covered so far. Darren asks, "Where do you place the VIP tickets? Are they purchasable on the landing page?"
[37:00] Yeah, so great question, Darren. Let's go through that together real quick. So this was the page that we would drive the traffic to when we would do the challenge, and we would place the opportunity to purchase right here on the page itself.
[37:15] For us, this was initially the difference between our $79 and $99 price. The prices that you're seeing here now, keep in mind that was towards the extreme tail end of that promotion timeline.
[37:30] This would have been 79 and this would have been the 99. And as you can see, there's a few key differences. Obviously with the general admission, you just get access to the challenge. That's it.
[37:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "VIP Upgrade Components"

[38:15] With the VIP, you get this private pre-event strategy session. This is the main thing I want you to understand about the VIP. It just essentially grants an extra day. It's like a bonus session is how it's framed.
[38:30] We would do this prior to the actual challenge starting. And then in addition to that, we would have what we called a breakout session. And the breakout session in this case wasn't even with Cody. This is with our head of product named Lloyd.
[38:45] This is pretty much it. I don't think that anybody took advantage of this, but keep in mind this is just like replays of all the sessions. So pre-event little session with Cody and in the middle of the challenge event with their head of product Lloyd. That was it.
[39:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Challenge Landing Page Structure"

VISUAL: Layout de página completo: Hero section com preços, timer countdown destacado no topo, seção de agenda com horários específicos por dia, speakers section com fotos (Josh, Lloyd, Dan, Pace), FAQ section extensa no rodapé. Video thumbnail integrado.
[39:30] So and then this is the page itself. This essentially was just a buy button. This is how the page looked. There was a timer on the page at different stages for the true early bird pricing and the extended early bird pricing.
[39:45] And then obviously just from there, the countdown to the actual event itself. This is the agenda for the event. We had the speakers. You guys will probably recognize Josh here. So Josh is the sales team on Cody's account.
[40:00] One strategic thing that you could do is Lloyd works in her business. He's the head of product. He's the person who's essentially responsible for the community and all the people that buy.
[40:15] Josh is the head of the sales team. Some really good information in the sessions that were covered from both of these in the trenches people. They also brought in some guest speakers, Dan and Pace.

[40:45] I want to be really clear when I say this. This is not necessary. This does not drive additional sales for the most part. What this is intended to do by bringing in other speakers is to alleviate some of the responsibility and the workload.
[41:00] Doing three full days of a challenge yourself can be exhausting, guys. These events, they really will wear and tear on you if you did the full three days. Look at the times here. So 11 to 6:30, 11 to 8:00 pm and then 11 to 4:30.
[41:15] Imagine being live that whole time. You just don't do it. So what you end up doing is you end up having a session and then you take a break. Do a session, do lunch. That's also when that first VIP breakout happens.
[41:30] Do a session, take a break, do a session, end the day, do a session, take a break, do a session, pitch take a break, do a session. You want to have some room to not have to do all that yourself. So, bringing in guest speakers can make a lot of sense.

[42:15] This is where we'd have the ticket pricing. This is where all the buttons on the page would lead you to. We had a few key questions here that we got answered. This video hosted on YouTube.
[42:30] In this case, if I had full control over this, this would have been hosted on Wistia. So, we could also put a video thumbnail here and so we could see a lot of the video analytics a little better, like engagement rates and play rates.
[42:45] And then we just have a bunch of Q&A. I would highly recommend this is actually when we looked at our hot jar here, one of the sections that was read through and spent the most time on by users.
[43:00] So, if you made it to this section on the page, you would consume a lot of this. Not all of it, but a lot of this. A lot of people will take these questions and they'll turn them into whole sections. I would encourage that you just answer a whole lot of questions inside of one FAQ.

[43:45] This page did awesome to be clear. And then while we're here, I'll also just cover some of the ads that we did. There was about another 60K that was spent on Google AdWords for this and also a little bit on TikTok.
[44:00] We're looking at about $231,251 here on Facebook. You can see here our cost per purchase averaged out at about 46 bucks. I want to be really clear when I say this.
[44:15] This is over the entire duration of the promotion cycle across several campaigns. Give or take the time as you could see the purchase price went all the way up to like 84.
[44:30] These were some of the different times where we were seeing things that early bird pricing and then no early bird pricing and then we'd extend the early bird pricing and get more ticket sales again.
[44:45] Long story short, this is the differences you're seeing just in the promotion cycle timeline. If we look at a few of these here, just in terms of the actual ad creatives themselves.
[45:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Ad Creative Strategy: Images vs Videos"

[45:30] This would be a set of the ads that we ran at the very tail end. This would have been like the last week as an example that we'd be promoting. I will say I'm a big fan of videos.
[45:45] However, with this level of spend, there's a lot of videos that you have to make. Lot of videos. So, images help a lot, especially when you're at this scale and you're doing a lot of retargeting.
[46:00] This specifically would have been towards like the last week of the promotional cycle. This looks like these are some of the starting ads that we would use to articulate the challenge through static ads and videos.
[46:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Image Ad Best Practices"

[46:45] One thing I'll point out - image ads work best with a handful of words, maybe three to five max, sometimes six, just big giant words, and then usually just Cody as the brand asset in this case.
[47:00] Also one of our favorite things to do, we don't do it in every image, but we do it in a lot of them. If you notice little things like pointing a finger at something or the direction of where the person's looking is generally at the text.
[47:15] Those are just little pro tips. Always frame the person towards the text so people actually read it.

[48:00] The Main Street Millionaire method. This is the method that is now taught to more than thousand people about how to buy small businesses. This February, we are going to do a three-day intensive event all about the Main Street Millionaire method.
[48:15] How do we buy small businesses using creative structures in order to take businesses from one generation, the baby boomer generation, to the next generation and ensure that ownership stays in our hands?

[48:45] This system has 10 parts and we're going to break down every single one of those 10 parts over this 3-day experience. Plus, we got some special guests for you.
[49:00] So, I think you should be there to be one of the few the owners in a world where mostly they want us to write.
[49:15] One key thing I also want to point out there is you'll notice she talked about the 10 things. That's kind of how the whole challenge was themed around - we're going to theme it around buying businesses.
[49:30] And over the course of three days, we're going to cover these 10 things. This actually helps a lot to keep retention statistics high as you go through each one of the days.
[49:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Retention Strategy: The 10 Things Hook"

[50:15] Here's how this ends up working. You get a 70% show rate to day one. You might cover three out of the 10 things or four out of the 10 things. And they need to be really good.
[50:30] The first thing I just want to be exceptionally clear on is that helps with retention because then you show up to the second day and you're still like, "Oh, well, I still got another six out of the 10 things I got to learn."
[50:45] And even after the pitch on day two, you still have a lot of willingness to show up to day three and continue to listen to the rest of day two because you have the rest of those 10 things that you need to have covered.

[51:30] [More video examples play showing different angles and urgency messaging]
[52:00] I saw a study the other day that was fascinating. Essentially, it showed that only 6% of Americans own a business in the 1800s 80% of us owned a business.
[52:15] When the US was first created and slowly year after year after year, they chipped away at our ownership. Even Canada has more owners than we do here in the US.
[52:30] Now, the question I kept asking myself is, who took our businesses? The answer turns out private equity. In 2000, they own 4%. In 2020, they own 20% of all US businesses.

[53:15] I used to work in private equity. So, I thought that I would steal some homework from the private equity guys and give it back to us on Main Street.
[53:30] So, that we could take the playbook used by the richest guys in the world to buy businesses and apply it without intermediaries, without big huge bank accounts, but for the every man and woman.
[53:45] Do you script these? So, what we do for all our clients is we type up these ad idea documents. We send over things like this. We essentially don't necessarily script it to where they'll say it word for word.
[54:00] We just try to articulate some talking points that we'd prefer them to work through almost like we're sending over frameworks that we'd prefer them to use as talking points.

[54:45] We have this with pretty much every client that we ever work with. Long story short, this is generally what it looks like. Sometimes they're a little longer, sometimes they're a little shorter.
[55:00] But for the most part, we just send over essentially frameworks or talking points. Let me show you some of these other images.
[55:15] If we look at some of these other ones here, this is just another set of the last chance stuff. This looks like these are some of the starting ads that we would use to articulate the challenge through static ads and videos.

[55:45] Pretty simple. One thing I'll point out if you haven't recognized it yet, just to vocalize it, is image ads work best with a handful of words, maybe three to five max, sometimes six, just big giant words.
[56:00] And then usually just Cody as the brand asset in this case. Also one of our favorite things to do, we don't do it in every image, but we do it in a lot of them.

[56:45] We don't run any worldwide traffic. For that specific challenge we just ran towards the US which is what almost all of our people in the challenges do. That's just based on the people that we work with and their markets.
[57:00] I find that if you had an international audience with people literally from all over the world, you have some people from Dubai, Australia, Europe - you got to keep that in mind wherever you get a majority of your audience from.
[57:15] Wherever you get a majority of your buyers from is generally where you want to bias towards time frames that you preferably run these things through.

[57:45] These for her time that she did these were during the day time. These are noon to 4:00 p.m. or noon to 8:00 p.m. give or take the day. Smack in the middle of the day.
[58:00] In that last week, how many times did you bump up the price and how did you market that? We didn't necessarily market on the ad level all of the different price bumps that happened in the last week.
[58:15] The only thing that we would really do is market the fact that the true early bird pricing was ending. During this part of the promotion cycle as well, we would talk about the extended early bird ending.
[58:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Price Bump Marketing Strategy"

Última semana (Week 8): pequenos bumps sem anúncio grande, apenas on-page. Estratégia: big announcements para deadlines principais, silent bumps para urgência final.
[58:45] During this promotion cycle, we didn't talk about any of the price bumps or anything like that. And it's also important to note we still saw a lot of buyers towards the tail end, but not as much as you'd think.
[59:00] One thing that people like to talk about when they talk about challenges is you kind of get this gradient of buyers and you get a lot of them towards the tail end. That was not the case for us.
[59:15] That was what the expectation was set for, but that did not happen. We actually kind of saw the opposite. We saw more of our purchases towards the beginning.
[59:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Actual vs Expected Purchase Pattern"

[59:45] Once we got rid of the early bird pricing, they dropped. Then we realized we fucked up and brought back the actual extended early bird pricing. That brought ticket sales back up, but not to where they ended up probably right in this range.
[60:00] And then we saw a little bit of a jump towards the tail end of the promotional cycle. That's how it really ended up looking for us.
[60:15] We did not experience this massive end spike which is what a lot of people say. I do want to take a moment just while we're talking about promotion stuff and talk about one big mistake.

[60:45] One thing that people are talking about doing is taking people to a webinar or some people are calling it a master class and obviously from there promoting something like a 10K product through a call funnel.
[61:00] But in this case, the thing that I think is super shit that's currently being promoted as a good idea is to drive the traffic from an ad to a webinar and in the webinar you promote the challenge and you're selling the low ticket thing.
[61:15] We had spent in addition to all those ad dollars that you saw a full $50,000 on the promotion to this. And this was so stupid to me because we were front end profitable 1.9x.
[61:30] And this additional 50k would have brought in substantially greater quantities of people at a profit. And instead it took our cost per purchase, our cost per action, to $400 to $500 during this dumbass test that somebody had told us to do.

[62:15] I don't give a shit to be right, guys. I just want to make money. So the right way that actually worked for us was what I had showed you. We had driven the ad to the sales page and we put all our attention on the CRO of that page.
[62:30] If our cost per purchase was a little higher than what we'd want, we would just do classic bottleneck analysis - is our CPMs too high, is our click-through rate too low, is our on-page ad to checkout rate too low.
[62:45] Where could we put attention and what could we optimize around? And from here, we would then kick people over to each one of the OTOs, at which point we would jack up our AOV and we would end up in a profitable position.
[63:00] This ultimately ended up being the best thing for us. And this is what I'm currently seeing work. This is what I'm seeing work with the no-names. This is what I'm seeing work with the big dogs.

[63:45] In terms of show rates, your paid show rate expectation should be about 70%. We did the same stuff that we always talk about. We had a great confirmation page.
[64:00] The confirmation page in this case would have been buried towards the very tail end of this process because after the calendar and whether they denied or bought any of the OTOs they would have saw the confirmation page.
[64:15] We had a great valued dense hype sequence in terms of the emails that went out ahead of time. This was great. This helped a lot. And then of course per usual we had the hammer them strategy.
[64:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Hammer Them for 2-Month Cycle"
NÚMEROS: 6,000+ ticket buyers, Low tens of thousands spent, 150 minimum audience to start, Diffused sequence over 2 months, 15-20 frequency short form, 10-15 frequency long form
VISUAL: Timeline de 2 meses com Hammer Them campaign crescendo. Começa pequeno (150 pessoas), cresce exponencialmente (linha ascendente) até 6K+. Budget scaling mostrado paralelamente. Métricas de frequência: short form 15-20x, long form 10-15x. Nota: "Subsidized by front-end profit (1.9x ROAS)".
[65:00] The hammer them strategy in this case just like normal short form long form promoting it to the people. In this case we had a little over 6,000 people that have bought the ticket so we had to spend a pretty decent amount.
[65:15] I want to say we spent low tens of thousands of dollars on the hammer them strategy for the promotion of this just due to the quantity of people within it and was also what we call a diffused hammer them sequence.
[65:30] Keep in mind we had promotion cycle of about two months out so soon as people started purchasing and we hit the 150 audience to get the minimum of 100 people targetable, that's when we started the hammer them sequence.
[65:45] And obviously that continued to grow a pretty substantial amount week over week. So as we saw that continue to grow, we obviously had to continue to scale up the budget of the hammer them campaign.
[66:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Hammer Them Budget Strategy"
NÚMEROS: Included in 1.9x ROAS calculation, Subsidized by front-end profit, Not additional out-of-pocket burn

[66:30] It is important to note if you're running low on ad dollars, you might not be able to take advantage of the hammer them campaign depending on how big you go here and depending on how profitable you are on the front end.
[66:45] I do also want to take note when I say on the front end we were 1.9x profitable that does include the hammer them spend being taken against those costs and dollars made.
[67:00] So we were essentially subsidizing running the hammer them strategy for free based on what our front-end acquisition dollars were getting us. That's the ideal scenario. That way you're not just coming out of pocket and burning cash.
[67:15] I want to be fair and saying I didn't run a challenge in this case without these best practices. So, I have no idea what the show rate would be if we did not do these things because we just did them right away.
[67:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Financial Modeling Components"

[68:00] You do have to do financial modeling a little bit differently in this. Obviously you have your ad spend you've got to factor in. You then have your cost per purchase that you're factoring in. That gets you your total buyers on a line that you're going to see.
[68:15] Once you have your total buyers factor in, you then have give or take how many days you do that many days worth of show rates to factor in. So for this specific challenge, we did three days.
[68:30] So, we'd have three full days of show rates to factor into this thing. Day two is when you have the pitch. For us, day one is all about the content. Day two is like half content, half pitch, half Q&A and objection handling.
[68:45] Day three is like a rep pitch and more content. But day two is where the actual pitch is executed. So, one thing that you want to make sure that you factor into all of this as well is how many people were present during the pitch.

[69:30] Obviously the conversion rate of how many people went and took the action. For us, we had about 63-64% of people that were showed during the pitch. So, we'll just call that exposed to the pitch.
[69:45] This is very important to note. You can do this however you'd like. People do it differently. We chose to do it this way and we enjoyed it.
[70:00] What we ended up doing was telling people to do a 2K deposit. So, we had a 10K price and instead of just doing direct to check out on the 10K price, we told people to do 2K for a deposit.
[70:15] And then those people who did the deposit, they were allowed to book a call. And then from here, this is one thing that the salespeople are a little upset about, but whatever.
[70:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Commission Structure Strategy"
NÚMEROS: Day 2 buyers (deposit + call): 10% commission on $8K, Day 3 call-only buyers: 20% full commission, Gross 10% more overall
VISUAL: Tabela comparativa de comissões. Coluna 1 "DAY 2 DEPOSIT BUYERS": $2K paid → call → $8K collection → 10% commission. Coluna 2 "DAY 3 CALL ONLY": No deposit → call → $10K collection → 20% commission. Destaque: Estratégia Day 2 = mais lucrativa para empresa, menos para closer.
[70:45] The 2K deposit, the book a call - on the call itself, this is when the other 8K was cash collected. And instead of if we would drive everybody to the call without collecting a deposit, we would have paid 20% commissions.
[71:00] We drove everybody to book a call after paying a 2k deposit and we only paid 10% commissions as a result of that. So right away just that one decision net - I'm sorry it grossed 10% more just by doing a 2k deposit and then telling the closers to collect the other 8k.
[71:15] I do want to also take note that on day three when we were doing the rep pitch - so day two that was all that was done was get the deposit, book your call, cash collect the other 8K on the call, commit.
[71:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Day 3 Rep Pitch Strategy"

[71:45] Now on day three when we're doing the rep pitch and we're actually going back through everything, what we did on that step was tell everybody, listen, if you didn't buy yet, you didn't do your deposit, go book a call anyway.
[72:00] Go book a call anyway, talk to our people, get your questions answered. Let's see if we can get you the help you want. And obviously on those the closers were given 20% rather than 10% because they didn't buy already.
[72:15] So very important to take note on this. If you are going to do this, you can cash collect 2K, get the other 8K, lower your sales people's commissions as a result.
[72:30] The following day when you do your rep pitch, tell everybody to book a call regardless. Pay the sales people the full commissions.

[73:15] For the hammer them campaign, what was the frequency you wanted and over what time frame were you looking at it? Same frequency numbers. We still wanted a 15 to 20 frequency on the short form. We still wanted a 10 to 15 frequency on the long form.
[73:30] We just judged it over that entire promotion cycle timeline. So, long story short, at the end leading into the challenge itself, we just wanted to make sure we had the frequency numbers.
[73:45] In terms of spend, we did have to spend a lot more dollars as we got closer to the challenge to achieve that frequency, which is okay. We were okay with that.

[74:30] How much direction do you give clients on the content of the challenge? In this case, I didn't have to give much. Cody's very rich. She has plenty of help and support on this front.
[74:45] She hired two ladies, Barry and Blue. They have in South Carolina, outside of Charlotte. They have this room that people are in that's surrounded by giant screens where everybody's on Zoom and it's really high quality videography.
[75:00] That was where they did this challenge at for this 3-day event. They had all the speakers fly out and yeah, they absolutely killed it.
[75:15] To be clear, our no-name people that we work with, they don't do that. They just do the challenge itself on Zoom, like what you and I are doing right now as an example.

[75:45] And for those clients, we generally have to give a lot more direction which we're about to go through together here. A lot of the times what we'll do is we'll just share examples. We'll share examples from past clients.
[76:00] I'm not able to share the actual Cody challenge content with you guys in terms of here's the recordings. However, we do have the recordings and we have many other challenge recordings from NDA clients.
[76:15] And the permission that we get with certain clients is that we have the ability to share them to other clients but we don't have the ability to share them in our education company in this case.
[76:30] Most of the time we'll just pull from our examples. We'll throw all those challenges and the frameworks that were in the challenges through Jeremy AI and we'll also throw them through tools like chat GBT or Claude as an example.

[77:15] A lot of the times it's really simple. Just to be clear on how simple the frameworks of the challenge are, I peppered this in when we were actually looking at the Cody ads when she mentioned in the video one of the video ads talking about the 10 things that she's going to cover.
[77:30] That's what most of the people for our challenges do. They'll essentially take the three days and they'll just break up 10 different things they're going to cover spread out over the three days.
[77:45] So, in total, there's these 10 concepts or these 10 things that you want to cover throughout this whole thing. And you might cover two or three or four of them on day one.
[78:00] And then five six seven maybe even eight and then nine and 10 on day two day three etc. That's how it ends up being broke down.

Lado direito: pessoa dentro/through da porta (depois do challenge). Texto: "Opening the door", "Walking through", "In the game". Homework como bridge.
[78:45] When you just take the main thing of the challenge, whatever the giant thing is, you break it down into fractions. That's all you're trying to do. You're just essentially taking the concept of the main things.
[79:00] You're breaking it down into 10 things that you could teach. And just remember all of this ideally ties to an outcome or a set of outcomes.
[79:15] And the smartest thing to do with challenges - this is very underutilized as a tactic - you want to just get people started with whatever you're going to teach them. Just get people in the game, get them going.
[79:30] When you think about it like that, it's really not that hard. Generally, that's as far as we obviously need to go with most of these clients. We just got to tell them things like that.
[79:45] And then it's generally really easy for them to come up with whatever those 10 things are. And then we just from there, we give them a framework.

[80:30] One thing that we'll have - ideally this is all getting done within this next two maybe three weeks tops. We'll have our challenge funnel SOP created which just like the mastering webinars SOP will have a framework that you can plug all these things into.
[80:45] For now, we're covering these kind of things on this call like this. Let's go on. So, here's how this ends up looking in terms of the three days.
[81:00] Day one is all content. It needs to be value dense. Treat day one like the reason people show up for the rest. This is important to note the reason people show up for day two.
[81:15] Ideally day one also has some kind of homework, something that you're going to send them home to do. That way the day doesn't stop when you stop the content.

[81:45] Ideally the day stops the following day at the end of day two. This is very important to know. It's like a continuation essentially.
[82:00] It's like what I do with master internet marketing where I have the whole live class and then we have the worksheets during the class and then we have the homework library in between that and the next live class. It's like an extension.
[82:15] You want to keep people immersed in the reality. Very very undermined tactic. When I talk and say it's all content and it's very valued dense, I just want to be really clear on what I mean by value dense.
[82:30] You have to actually be talking about things that people are attentive to, give a shit about, find value in. If you find yourself seeing people have their eyes glaze over or you're seeing people start to drop, you need to immediately move on.

[83:15] You need to immediately move on from whatever you're talking about and you need to get right back into something that actually hits harder than what you're communicating at that point. Very critical must must do.
[83:30] When we look at the content itself, as I mentioned, you're trying to take the 10 things that are covered, and you're ideally covering about four of them. When you tie it in with I'm here to get people in the game, I'm here to get people started.
[83:45] Generally the first things that you have to do is you have to cover what the game is and how it works. If we look at Cody's challenge as an example of this, we have a very simple thing that we must do first.
[84:00] We have to explain to people why it's a good opportunity. We have to articulate how the game works. We can't just get people to play a game if they don't know what the game is, know the rules of the game.

[84:45] And understand the outcomes that they're looking for, how you win and how you lose, who the characters are in the game that you're playing with. You have to introduce the game to people.
[85:00] But I want to be really clear when I say this. This can still be articulated in a very valued way. When you say things, it's like a gaming tutorial. If any of you here have ever played a video game in your life.
[85:15] Or maybe even watched a movie that articulates this a particular way and you don't skip through the tutorial part of it, that's when you know they've done a great job at explaining to you the rules of the game, how the game works, why you're there, and what the outcomes are.
[85:30] Versus if you ever played a game and you just are desperate to skip over the tutorial because it all seems so easy and it doesn't make sense to be attentive to - in this case in your challenge that would be the wrong way to articulate it comparatively.

[86:15] We have to be able to explain to people and just get them involved. Remember it's like we're opening a door for them is essentially the whole point of day one and at the end of day one they should feel like they walked through the door.
[86:30] Very important to understand that analogy I just articulated to you. Opening the doors, articulating the rules of the game, the game itself, how you win the game, how you lose the game, the characters in the game.
[86:45] Walking them into the door by the end of day one means they feel a part of the game now. They feel in the game. They've been giving some tasks to start the game.
[87:00] At the end of day one, they must be assigned to do something. Has to happen that way. Homework has to be something that they do and show up to day two talking about.

[87:45] Because that's essentially the intro to day two. So, day two starts with go over homework results, show that people are already doing it. Very undermined tactic.
[88:00] Let me articulate a little further what I mean. Way back in the day, Dan Lok and I did a challenge. We called it the freedom challenge. And we were teaching people how to start making money on the internet.
[88:15] Obviously, we were going to teach people how to start marketing agencies. And the whole concept of day one was we wanted to just introduce that the best vehicle to make money on the internet was a marketing agency.
[88:30] And we also started talking about how easy it was to do something as simple as build a client list of people that you were going to pitch. And so the homework between day one and day two was to build a lead list.

[89:15] Build a lead list, pick a niche, start getting some people that you could contact because day two, what we were going to do is we were going to teach people how to pitch, what to pitch them on, some services they could sell.
[89:30] Some partners that they could sell those services through if they didn't have the skills themselves yet. And the homework on day two, this was a five-day challenge in this case, the homework on day two was to go and actually pitch some people.
[89:45] And what we would do, and this was essentially the equivalent of our day two homework results, but for us it was on day three, we had people show up and they said, "I'm already pitching people and I've already got some responses."
[90:00] "I'm already seeing I've already got some sales calls booked." And so the thing is what you ideally have happen on day two in this case by telling people to go and do something on day one.

[90:45] They show up for day two and you have some people that you can call out where you're like, "Hey, so let's go over some homework results. Who got a great result already? Who's out there taking action?"
[91:00] "Who's actually doing what we taught and who's out here actually in the trenches already?" And you get some people that immediately deserve praise and rightfully so. They actually did what you talked about and they got a result from doing it already.
[91:15] That makes everybody who didn't do this stuff know that it works. They feel a lot safer and therefore the probability of people buying and their willingness to buy goes up tremendously.
[91:30] But in addition to that, it just further engulfs people into the idea that they're officially a part of this whole thing and it makes them feel like they're through the door. Very critical.

[92:15] Day two is more content for the first part and second part of the day, but it's very important. The first half of the day is a lot of pre-framing material. We call it the pre-pitch.
[92:30] One of the coolest people that I've learned from in the internet marketing space is an older guy named Myron Golden. Got a little bit of a limp. Really one of the smarter people I think I've met in this internet marketing space.
[92:45] You pay Myron like whatever he's charging at the time - it could be like 35k to 50k, give or take whatever he feels like charging. And he'll do this thing he calls million dollar days.
[93:00] Myron's whole stick is that he's teaching you how to just crush it at in-person events. And a lot of his lessons also correlate to challenges. So, big shout out to Myron on this next part.

[93:45] Myron has two things you could pay him for outside of learning how to make a million dollars in a day at an event, which he calls the pre-pitch and the rep pitch.
[94:00] You can pay Myron a large percentage of your earnings that you're going to make at an event by having him do the pre-pitch and the rep pitch. And the pre-pitch specifically is incredibly valuable.
[94:15] You are teaching people framing lessons that all are going to increase the probability they'd buy. And a lot of the framing lessons have to do with common objections and reasons that people wouldn't take action.
[94:30] And you're trying to address those things prematurely and in rather indirect ways because keep in mind you hadn't pitched people yet.
[94:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Pre-Pitch Example: First Mover's Advantage"
NÚMEROS: $100, $50, $20, $10, $5, $1 bills used, 5 people on stage, First person makes most, Last makes least
VISUAL: Demonstração de palco. 5 pessoas em linha. Presenter segurando bills de diferentes valores. Pessoa 1 pega $100 (verde, grande). Pessoa 2 pega $50. Pessoa 3 pega $20. Pessoa 4 pega $10. Pessoa 5 pega $5. Audiência (não age) = $0. Visual lesson de first mover advantage.
[95:15] A lot of pre-pitch material - I have plenty of examples of this. Let me see if I can actually find some for you guys that I've done myself so you can see me literally doing it on stage.
[95:30] You can do these same things virtually, of course. It just depends on your skill. It definitely takes skills to be able to pull some of these things off.
[95:45] [Shows video example of first mover's advantage demonstration]
[96:00] Takes action. It's a very simple lesson. The person who takes action first, they make the most money. The person who takes action first, they get the most.
[96:15] The person who takes action second, they don't make as much, but they still do well, right? The person who takes the third action still gets paid, but the person who goes last, he got a dollar, right? Give him a round of applause.
[96:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "First Mover's Advantage Lesson"
NÚMEROS: Story: $100M/week from secondary market shares, Being first = most market share
VISUAL: Story framework. Setup: Billionaire making $100M/week vendendo shares no secondary market. Ponto: "First one doing it = most advantage". Demonstração física com dinheiro reforça lesson. Takeaway: "People who act first make most, people who don't act make nothing".
[96:45] So, it's a rather simple lesson. It's called first mover's advantage. The first person makes the most, second person makes the second most, third person makes the third most as long as they don't blow it respectively.
[97:00] But the people who sit on the sideline, the people who chose not to do anything, which is you, you didn't get any upside, right? You just got to watch and learn lessons.
[97:15] A perfect example of the pre-pitch in that example is me just holding up these dollars and explaining through a story initially about how there was a guy he framed himself as a billionaire.
[97:30] Claimed that he was making a lot of money taking private companies selling their shares on the secondary market to people. These would be like a company giving employees shares.
[97:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Pre-Pitch Reinforcement"
NÚMEROS: 5 people on stage take action = get paid, Audience (no action) = $0, Reinforces: action takers win
VISUAL: Before/after comparison. Before pitch: lesson é indirect, sobre "billionaire" e "secondary markets". Durante demonstration: tangível, visual, $100 vs $0. After: audiência internalize "I need to act or I get nothing". Não é explícito sobre o offer ainda, mas planta seed.
[98:15] Before the company goes public but they intend to go public eventually. Those companies want liquidity. They would take those shares and they would sell them to people before the company went public.
[98:30] That was obviously the only other way you could buy shares in a company was through an employee or some insider. And this guy who framed that he did this was making he claimed $100 million a week and it was crazy.
[98:45] And I was like how the fuck did you make so much money doing that and he was like well I was the first one doing it. So he gained the most market share and he had the most advantage over everybody else.
[99:00] And then I get to the point where I bring five people up on stage and I do that dollar example that you just saw. And what's that reinforce to people?
[99:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Pre-Pitch Example 2: Penny Vision"
NÚMEROS: $40M/week story, Penny blocking view of bigger opportunity
VISUAL: Demonstração física. Penny segurado perto dos olhos (bloqueia visão). Atrás do penny: papel grande com "$40M/WEEK" ou oportunidade grande. Myron's lesson: "Move the penny to see the bigger opportunity". Analogia: pequenos bloqueios mentais impedem ver grandes oportunidades. Audiência grita "MOVE THE PENNY".
[99:45] Well it reinforces that the people who take the action they make the most and the people who don't take any action, they don't make anything, which is everybody in the audience in that example.
[100:00] And in this case, when it comes to a pre-pitch, that's a perfect example of what I'm trying to sit here and articulate to you. You have the ability to do the same digitally by considering what are the pre-framing lessons that need to be covered.
[100:15] First mover's advantage is a perfect example of that. Here's another example.
[100:30] [Shows second video example of penny vision]
[100:45] I had the privilege to go to a lunch with one of my clients. Unknowingly, this guy's a billionaire. He sits across from me at lunch and he casually drops on me that he was making $40 million a week.
[101:00] I was like, "Holy shit, I felt so small." I've never felt more poor in my life. Many of you even asked the question to yourself how you can make $40 million a week.
[101:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Penny Vision Application"
NÚMEROS: Sometimes need to pay others to tell you to move the penny
VISUAL: Aplicação da lesson ao pitch futuro. Objeção comum: "Why would I pay for information?". Pre-frame: "Sometimes you have something small (penny) blocking a much bigger opportunity ($40M/week)". Você precisa de alguém para te dizer "move the penny" para ver o que está na frente. Justifica pagar por insight.
[101:45] Might sound unrealistic, might sound unbelievable, but it starts with the question. This represents that 40 million a week to me. This, on the other hand, is a penny.
[102:00] You might have something that's blocking your ability to see the bigger opportunity that's right in front of you just through a simple conversation. Was able to help me move that penny and see all these bigger ideas, these bigger ways to execute.
[102:15] There's more money right in front of me that I couldn't even see because I had to have somebody else tell me to remove that penny so I could see the bigger opportunity.
[102:30] Myron calls that one penny vision. So, he'll have the whole audience yell at him to move the penny and he'll tell it through some different stories.
[102:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Pre-Pitch Lesson Types"
NÚMEROS: 10-15 different framing lessons recommended, Examples: First mover's advantage, Penny vision, Group think, Bet before knowing everything
VISUAL: Lista de pre-pitch lesson categories: 1) "ACTION INCENTIVES" (first mover), 2) "VISION BLOCKERS" (penny), 3) "KNOWLEDGE PARALYSIS" (bet before knowing), 4) "HISTORICAL PROOF" (examples de winners), 5) "OPPORTUNITY COST" (watchers vs players). 10-15 total recomendado antes do pitch.
[103:15] Penny vision, when I'm going to pitch somebody on something that requires me to tell them to do stuff that can make them more money, pre-framing that by just saying, "Look, man, sometimes you got to pay other people to tell you to move the penny."
[103:30] And then you could see a much bigger opportunity that's right in front of you. And if you just drop 10 to 15 different things like this in front of people, you have a really good opportunity.
[103:45] For when you actually get to the point where you do the pitch to have people in the right kind of frame where a lot of the objections - well why would I pay somebody for information?
[104:00] That's the logic of penny vision. Sometimes you got something so small that's in your way and you just require somebody else to tell you to move it in order to see something that's much larger right in front of you.
[104:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Pre-Pitch Lesson: Bet Before Knowing Everything"
NÚMEROS: Historical examples of early bets = big paydays, Crypto example: limited supply = price goes up
VISUAL: Timeline histórica mostrando early adopters vs late adopters. Early (verde): Bitcoin early buyers, grandes ganhos, não sabiam tudo. Late (vermelho): pessoas esperando entender tudo, perdendo oportunidade. Curva de preço do Bitcoin subindo. Lesson: "Don't need to know everything to take action and win".
[104:45] Sometimes you need an incentive to take action, like you need a reason to be like the person who actually does it now versus later.
[105:00] We also would tell stories about things like group think. We show this graph like this curve of people who would make bets before they actually knew everything about stuff.
[105:15] One of the biggest reasons that people don't actually take action on things is they feel like they need to know everything prior to taking the action.
[105:30] So if I can get people in the mental frame that it's actually smarter to take an action before you know everything about what you're going to do that you get a bigger result and bigger upside.
[105:45] That makes a lot more sense comparatively to waiting until you understand everything. So I can go and I can look back in history for a lot of these kinds of stories.
[106:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Crypto Example: Act Without Full Knowledge"
NÚMEROS: Limited Bitcoin supply, More buyers = higher price, Early risk = big reward
VISUAL: Gráfico de adoção de Bitcoin. Curva ascendente de preço. Dois tipos de pessoas destacados: 1) "EARLY ADOPTERS" (verde) - entenderam conceito básico (limited supply), agiram, ganharam muito. 2) "WAITING TO UNDERSTAND" (vermelho) - querem saber tudo, compram mais caro ou nunca compram. Lesson reinforcement visual.
[106:30] Where I can see in history examples of people who before they understood everything made a big bet and got a huge payday as a result of it because they took the action prior to understanding the full picture.
[106:45] And then I could talk about the people who are no names in history that nobody's ever heard of that they waited until they understood the full thing.
[107:00] And as an example of this in modern day, this might be cryptocurrency. I still meet people today that they don't understand the full picture of Bitcoin or they don't understand the concept of cryptocurrency in general.
[107:15] But that doesn't negate the fact that there's a bunch of retards and smart people that have made a fuckload more money than you doing in it. And it's kind of silly to think that they knew everything about it.
[107:30] There's plenty of examples in the crypto world that you can literally go look up online. These are public stories that have YouTube videos about them now to be able to reference in your pre-pitch material.
[107:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Pre-Pitch Purpose Summary"
NÚMEROS: Address common objections indirectly, 10-15 framing lessons before pitch, Increase buy probability without being direct
VISUAL: Funnel de preparação mental. Topo: "COMMON OBJECTIONS" (lista: need more info, why pay, timing, etc). Middle: "PRE-PITCH LESSONS" (10-15 stories/frameworks que endereçam indiretamente). Bottom: "PRIMED TO BUY" (audiência mentalmente preparada). Nota: "Indirect = powerful, they don't realize they're being sold".
[108:15] Where you showcase some dude who he just heard that there's a limited supply of Bitcoin and then obviously the more Bitcoin that get bought the higher the prices got to go as a result.
[108:30] Sure, you might not understand everything else there is to know about it. But if you understand that alone, it kind of makes sense to put money into it because it's always probable to continue going up as long as people continue to buy it.
[108:45] And think about the people who took a very early risk and think about the reward that they achieved as a result. I know really smart people right now that they're just waiting until they understand the entirety of it.
[109:00] And they're going rather slow at it, not even really intentionally trying to learn everything about it, which is even worse because that obviously further delays the action and it makes them buy at a later and later and later price.
[109:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Pre-Pitch Effectiveness"
NÚMEROS: Really simple framing material, Look at common reasons NOT to buy, Address them indirectly before pitch

Coluna direita: pre-pitch lessons que endereçam cada uma (first mover, penny vision, investment = seriousness, proof stories). Linhas conectando objeções a lessons. Check marks verdes quando matched.
[109:45] So, it's like again my point is really simple pre-framing material. You want to look at the common reasons and motives for why people don't do stuff related to your offer and why people do things about your offer.
[110:00] The pre-pitch is again just one of the most critical parts of the day two right before the pitch material that you're going to drop. And it's so important.
[110:15] I tried to give you a few examples of what the pre-pitch kind of sounds like, but that's ultimately what you're trying to do in that first half of the day on day two.
[110:30] You're going through the homework results and you're trying to just show that there's already people who are in the game that are amongst them right now. And then you're doing your pre-pitch.
[110:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Day 2 Flow Complete"

[111:15] At this point, you then are going into the full-blown pitch. This is right before lunch is when you're ideally doing this. You're then going to take your break.
[111:30] You're going to come back from lunch and you're going to do kind of an objection handling Q&A. And this is really important to note you can have strategic questions dropped into the chat by staff.
[111:45] Or people that you plant there that just answer a lot of the common questions that are otherwise going to go unanswered if somebody doesn't ask you.
[112:00] So, strategically planting questions can be a great way to also just kind of intro into the objections, get all the questions flowing. And then from here, it's very important.
[112:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Day 2 Second Half: CRITICAL"

Reality check (verde): "MUST deliver value, people paid for challenge outcome too, this saves Day 3 show rate". Comparação: Low effort Day 2 afternoon = bad reviews + low Day 3 show.
[112:45] You're just going to end the day with your normal content. You really have to save the day here for the second part if you want to get people to show up for the third day.
[113:00] The second half of day two is a very undermined part of the day. You're likely going to feel like you've completed your mission because you'll likely have gotten the purchases at this point.
[113:15] You've likely gotten the calls scheduled. You've gotten your buyers and you're going to feel like you've gotten the nut. You're not going to need mentally to exert yourself as aggressively as you just did up to this point.
[113:30] Because you've essentially accomplished what you came here to do. And that is a mistake to dwell in that mental state.
[113:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Challenge Outcome vs Sales Outcome"

[114:15] You must recover the second half of day two by going right back into extremely valued dense content. You must. That is the ultimate measure of the show rate for day three is this right here.
[114:30] That's what dictates show rate for day three is you going back to - remember all we're trying to cover in day two. This is where we officially have to talk about these other things.
[114:45] This is where we have to get back into the value. This is where we have to get back into the theme of the challenge. This is when we have to jump back into helping people get the outcomes.
[115:00] Because remember the people who showed up to your paid challenge, they bought something too. They bought the outcome that you're helping produce through the challenge itself regardless as to whether they buy or not.

[115:45] If you lose that mental frame, you will have a very bad time. You will get bad reviews. You will shorten the lifespan of your ability to do more challenges.
[116:00] Remember, the whole concept of challenges is ideally we can do these things up to about six times a year. We're not going to be able to run challenges six times a year if we're not actually helping people get results through our challenge.
[116:15] We got to do a phenomenal job at the content of the challenge to make people say great things about it, to make them rave about it, to make it feel like I'm actually pleased with the fact that this person pitched on day two.
[116:30] I'm more excited to just get back to the content now. Day two, the whole second half of day two is just straight content back to the value dense information.
[116:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Day 3 Structure: Rep Pitch"

[117:15] Now, day three. Day three generally starts with what we call the rep pitch. Again, shout out to Myron Golden on this. This is all Myron Golden's lessons right here for what I'm talking about with the rep pitch.
[117:30] And Myron is far greater at it than I am for sure. This is where Myron makes a lot of his money. As I described, this is where Myron will get like upwards of 30 to 40% of your sales.
[117:45] Because he's going to officially capture people that weren't otherwise going to buy back up on stage and repitching. Now, the rep pitch and the pre-pitch are very different because the rep pitch is much more direct.
[118:00] As I showed you in some of the pre-pitch material that I did myself on stage or the other example with the crypto example I provided, it's very indirect.
[118:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Rep Pitch vs Pre-Pitch"

[118:45] I don't have to tell people, hey, if you don't take action first on what I'm going to sell you here soon, you're a loser. It's like I don't have to do shit like that.
[119:00] The pre-pitch is just intended to plant specific ways to think before I do my pitch for my benefit. The rep pitch is much more direct.
[119:15] The rep pitch is - listen to this - the rep pitch is taking all the lessons from the pre-pitch and officially being direct about them and reiterating them, but in a much more direct way. That's the whole concept of the rep pitch.
[119:30] So, in the rep pitch, I would officially be saying things like, "Listen, everybody who took action yesterday, congratulations. You're one of those people that would have been the equivalent of grabbing the $100 bill."

[120:15] "You would have been one of the ones that took action first. You would have been one of the ones, even if you get the $5 bill, man. Even if you don't make a lot with this, you're going to make something."
[120:30] "It's going to be easy for you to make back the money you're spending with me. Think about this. You took action, right? But let's talk to the people here who didn't take action yet."

VISUAL: Poll results visual. Overwhelming "1"s (verde) = "BELIEVABLE TRUTH". Muito poucos "2"s (vermelho) = "Manipulation". Ponto provado: Rep pitch funciona porque é baseado em verdades acreditáveis, não manipulação. Lesson: "If you invest more, you take it more seriously" = universally true.
[129:15] Dude, that's rep pitch material right there. You see what I mean? Do me a favor. Drop a one in the chat if you're feeling what I'm saying right now. You understand the power of that?
[129:30] It's so good. So, it's like when people hear that kind of stuff, and you're repitching them - that's the thing with the rep pitch. It's not like you're just sitting there saying, "All right, guys, this is what comes with it, this is how much it is."
[129:45] It's like you're saying that stuff too, but you're weaving it in with lessons like that where you're really trying to inspire action. You see what I'm saying? With things that actually make sense.
[130:00] Do me a favor again. Please be brutally honest with me. Drop a one in the chat if you actually believe what I just said to be true. Drop a two in the chat if it just sounds like I'm full of shit.
[130:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Rep Pitch Proof: Real Example"
NÚMEROS: Client story: $8K total, Spent $5K on MIM (Dec 5), Made $30K by Dec 15, Wanted to see son for Christmas in US (was in Colombia)
VISUAL: Timeline de caso real. Dec 5: "$8K in account, spent $5K on course". Dec 6-15: "Took it SERIOUSLY (had to or couldn't see son)". Dec 15: "Made $30K". Outcome: "Christmas with son + gifts". Ponto: Ele investiu muito (relativamente) → levou a sério → resultado rápido. Prova da lesson de investment = results.
[130:45] And that's an unbelievable thing I articulated. That simple lesson I just said of if you invest a lot, you take it a lot more seriously and you have a better outcome potential as a result.
[131:00] Drop a one in the chat if that's a believable thing or drop a two in the chat if I just sound absolutely full of shit and that's just a lie and a sales tactic.
[131:15] Get a bunch of ones in the chat. Why? It's a believable thing. You see, it's a reason that you can actually have some certainty in. And I can back it up further with proof.
[131:30] That's the thing. I can back it up further with proof. I could tell stories of guys like there was a guy, he joined into my master internet marketing program. It was early December. He bought in on December 5th.
[131:45] I would never condone somebody doing this to be clear, but he did it anyway. He hid it from us. Listen to this. This guy had $8,000 in his account. He was in Colombia at the time. He's an American citizen. He has a son.
[132:00] He wanted to come back to America and spend Christmas with his son. He spent $5,000 of his $8,000 on Master Internet Marketing on December 5th.
[132:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Why This Story Works in Rep Pitch"
NÚMEROS: Same price as others ($5K), Different outcome (made $30K in 10 days vs others taking year), Difference: INVESTMENT level (had to succeed)
VISUAL: Comparação dramática. Person A: "$5K course, casual approach, 1 year to ROI". Person B (highlighted): "$5K course, DESPERATE INVESTMENT (only $3K left, must see son), 10 DAYS to $30K ROI". Pergunta visual: "WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?". Resposta: "HOW SERIOUSLY THEY TOOK IT".
[132:45] It took him until about December 15. I think it was a few days prior to that. He had made $30,000 because you know why? He had taken the program extremely seriously.
[133:00] He didn't invest more than everybody else who's bought it. Everybody else bought it for the same price. But I'm sure you can tell where I'm going with this.
[133:15] He wanted to come back home and have Christmas with his son. He wanted to make sure he could buy his son gifts. And if he didn't, if he failed to make the money back in a rather tight time frame, what would have happened?
[133:30] He wouldn't have had Christmas with his kid. He wouldn't have been able to buy gifts for the kid. He would have been stuck in Colombia.
[133:45] Really think about this real quick. Why did that guy get a phenomenal result in a very short time frame? Why does some people who buy it take a year to get the 5K made back?
[134:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Rep Pitch Formula"
NÚMEROS: Batter people with lessons for first half of Day 3, Then pitch, Then lunch, Then more content
VISUAL: Day 3 morning structure (primeira metade). Múltiplos blocos de "REP PITCH LESSON" empilhados: Sports analogy, Investment = seriousness, Real proof stories, Self-reflection moments, Opportunity cost. Então: "PITCH + CALL TO ACTION". Então: "LUNCH". Então: "CONTENT". Nota: "BATTER them with rep pitch material".
[134:30] It's an info product. Sometimes people ask, "Hey, is it worth it?" It's like, "Well, you're the one who makes it worth it. It's info. It's up to you."
[134:45] But that guy invested a lot. He didn't invest more dollars, but he invested a lot. And as a result of investing a lot, he got a big result in a tight time frame. Something to consider.
[135:00] You see what I'm saying? Dude, you just batter people with rep pitch shit like that for the whole first half of day three. And you essentially do the same thing.
[135:15] So you rep pitch and then you literally pitch and then you do lunch. And then again you close out day three with content and ensuring the challenge outcome.
[135:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Ensuring Challenge Outcome = Longevity"
NÚMEROS: Inner Circle example: Require 1 year minimum, Not for financial benefit alone, For RESULT guarantee
VISUAL: Timeline de longevidade. Short-term thinking (vermelho): "Get money, pitch hard, low delivery" → "Bad reviews" → "Dead in 1-3 challenges". Long-term thinking (verde): "Get money + DELIVER RESULTS" → "Great reviews" → "Repeat buyers" → "6 challenges/year for YEARS". Inner Circle example: 1 year requirement = resultado garantido.
[135:45] Remember give yourself longevity. One thing I'll give you a perfect example of this when I talk about ensuring the challenge outcome so you have longevity to what you do.
[136:00] I do it in the inner circle. I tell people don't even join into this thing unless you're going to be in here for a year. Is that just for my financial benefit? No.
[136:15] Do I like your money over the course of a year? Yeah. But what are you actually probable to experience over the course of a year comparatively to being in here for a month?
[136:30] You're probable to actually get a big result. That's what we sell. We sell people big results, big outcomes. I don't want you to get a little dinky result.
[136:45] I don't want a guy that's in here for two months and then just leaves. Because guess what? That person gets to go out there and say that their little dinky result is all they got.
[137:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Representative Quality = Brand Longevity"
NÚMEROS: Inner Circle: 6 years running (since 2019), Requires 1 year commitment = better results = better representatives
VISUAL: Ciclo virtuoso de longevidade. Centro: "GET PEOPLE BIG RESULTS". Seta para: "GREAT REPRESENTATIVES" (high-level people). Seta para: "ATTRACT MORE HIGH-LEVEL PEOPLE". Seta para: "PROGRAM HAS LIFE/LONGEVITY". Seta de volta para centro. Versus ciclo vicioso: Poor results → Bad reps → Program dies quickly.
[137:30] Their little shitty business is - they're a representative of me and my skill set to get big results versus if I have someone in here for a year.
[137:45] I have a dramatically higher probability of getting that person a big result and therefore I have a dramatically higher probability of having a fleet of high-level people that get to say they're a part of my thing.
[138:00] Which gets more high-level people a part of my thing which gives this thing life. It gives it longevity.
[138:15] How fast do you think this would fizzle out? I've been doing the inner circle since 2019, man. It's been six years.
[138:30] People who fizzle out, people who have challenges that fizzle out, people that have conversion mechanisms of any kind that fizzle out, they fizzle out.
[138:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Challenge Longevity Requirements"
NÚMEROS: Only 1-3 challenges possible if no results delivered, 6 challenges/year sustainable if results delivered, Scale requires outcomes
VISUAL: Comparação de lifespan. Scenario A (vermelho): "NO RESULTS FOCUS" = 1-3 challenges máximo = dead = reputation burned. Scenario B (verde): "RESULTS FOCUS" = 6 challenges/year = years of success = growing reputation. Nota grande: "CARE ABOUT THE RESULTS YOU GET PEOPLE".
[139:15] They have offers that die because they don't give a shit about the longevity of it. How do you factor in longevity to something like this? Get people outcomes.
[139:30] Care about the results you get people. Yes, the point of the challenge is to make a huge lumpsum. That's obviously the point of the challenge.
[139:45] But we only have the ability to do that maybe one to three times before it just burns out and our reputation is fucked if we do this at scale and don't get people who don't buy a result through the challenge.
[140:00] The content of the challenge still has to be phenomenal. Has to be phenomenal. There has to be an outcome. There has to be a result.
[140:15] There has to be something that people walk away with and say, "You know what, man? That was awesome. I'm glad I spent the time doing that."
[140:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Duality of Challenge Success"
NÚMEROS: Intention 1: Fat giant lumpsum ($4M example), Intention 2: Get challenge result delivered, Both required for longevity
VISUAL: Balança perfeitamente equilibrada. Lado 1: "FAT LUMPSUM" (dinheiro, revenue, calls, sales). Lado 2: "CHALLENGE OUTCOME" (results, transformations, value delivered). Ambos com peso igual. Texto grande: "MUST BALANCE BOTH". Nota: "One without other = short-term only".
[140:45] Get people the result, man. Get people the result of the challenge. Just remember that. It's a duality. You must balance both in order to have life with this and in order to truly maximize the result potential from it.
[141:00] All right, I'm going to take a moment just to answer any questions that any of you have. We're done. We can wrap it up. Feel free to unmute yourself and ask away if you've got anything.
[141:15] You can also drop questions in the chat if you'd prefer. Up to you. Anybody going once?
[141:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Q&A: AI Agent Challenge Theme"
NÚMEROS: Google Trends comparison: AI agents vs Cold plunges (similar interest), AI general term = much larger
VISUAL: Gráfico de Google Trends mostrando 5 anos. Linha "AI AGENTS" (azul) vs "COLD PLUNGES" (verde) = similar height (conhecimento comparável). Linha "AI" (vermelho) = MUITO mais alta. Conclusão: Theme challenge como "AI" geral, não "AI Agents" específico = maior apelo.
[142:00] [Question about AI agent challenge theming]
[142:15] Yeah, so this is a great question because it shows how you need to potentially mask the theme of the challenge to not be highly technical like that to have a little bit of broader appeal.
[142:30] If you look at that challenge example I talked about with Dan Lok and I, we called it the freedom challenge. How to make money online. We didn't talk about marketing agencies.
[142:45] We didn't talk about digital marketing. We talked about freedom coming from making money on the internet and then we introduced the vehicle of the marketing agency and digital marketing skills in the challenge itself.
[143:00] So sometimes it can look like that and other times you're selling into something that has a macro advantage right now.
[143:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Google Trends for Theme Research"
NÚMEROS: AI: Massive interest spike, AI Agents: Moderate interest, Cold Plunge: Comparison baseline
VISUAL: Tutorial de uso de Google Trends. Passo 1: Input termo ("AI agents"). Passo 2: Set timeframe (5 years mostra contexto melhor). Passo 3: Compare com outro termo (cold plunge como baseline de "conhecimento comum"). Passo 4: Analyze = AI agents = known, mas "AI" = muito mais conhecido.
[143:45] Here's a great way to literally do research. Let's use Google Trends as an example to see if people actually give a shit about what you're currently talking about.
[144:00] [Shows Google Trends comparison of AI agents vs cold plunge]
[144:15] As you could see, AI agents are almost just as known and as searched currently as cold plunges. The reason I use cold plunges in this example, think about how - anybody on this call not know what a cold plunge is?
[144:30] No, we obviously all know what a cold plunge is. So, when I compare that to AI agents, arguably could I say that people know what AI agents are, too? Yeah.
[144:45] At least there's relatively the same level of interest. There's a high probability that a lot of people do. They might not technically know what they are, but they generally know what they are.
[145:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Theme Selection Strategy"
NÚMEROS: Specific term (AI agents) = moderate appeal, Broader term (AI) = massive appeal, Choose broader for challenge theme
VISUAL: Funil de apelo. Topo (largo): "AI" - interesse massivo, audiência enorme. Meio (menor): "AI AGENTS" - interesse moderado, audiência menor. Base (estreito): "AI Agent Development" - interesse nichado, audiência pequena. Estratégia: Theme no topo do funil, deliver específico dentro.
[145:30] So, on your challenge page, you could technically directly theme it to AI agents. But you can also just in general just theme it to AI.
[145:45] And as you could see, just AI as a whole, look how much that just dwarfed cold plunges and AI agents.
[146:00] So, like arguably what would be better to theme it to? AI. AI in general. So, it's like in this case, I would just want to theme it as how to leverage artificial intelligence to outcome.
[146:15] And then that becomes the theme of the challenge. You see what I'm saying?
[146:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Q&A: GovTech Challenge Outcome"
NÚMEROS: 5-day challenge, Promise: double tech salary, Can't actually double in 5 days, Shows roadmap to double
VISUAL: Timeline de outcome. Não é: "Double your salary IN 5 days" (impossível, vermelho X). É: "Learn the ROADMAP to double your salary" (possível, verde check). Challenge cobre: Resume optimization, LinkedIn strategy, Positioning, etc. Outcome = STARTED on path, não completed.
[147:00] [Question about GovTech challenge outcome - can't double salary in 5 days]
[147:15] So here's how it would look for your challenge. You can help people do things that are on a technical level, make them aware of the things they need to do.
[147:30] And then I would imagine your product helps them get that result faster in doing it on their own, right?
[147:45] So it's like that's a great theme for a challenge, too. Let me show you in the challenge literally all of the highly technical shit that you need to do to go do it on your own. I'm gonna teach you literally all of it.
[148:00] And then the product is I can do it all for you and I can help you out and I can get you the result in a faster and easier way.
[148:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Technical Challenge Model"
NÚMEROS: Show them HOW to do it themselves (technical), Offer: Do it FOR them (faster/easier), Perfect challenge setup
VISUAL: Modelo de challenge técnico. Lado esquerdo: "CHALLENGE" - ensina todos os technical steps, how to DIY, awareness de complexidade. Seta para lado direito: "OFFER" - "I'll do it for you", faster, easier, guaranteed results. Setup perfeito: eles veem trabalho envolvido → mais dispostos a pagar por done-for-you.
[148:45] Layup deals right there. Layup deals. Another great example of a challenge. And that's a great, by the way, that's an incredible challenge for sure. Those styles of challenges love them, dude. Those are awesome.
[149:00] [Closing remarks about upcoming SOPs and resources]
[149:15] We're about 70% of the way through the challenge funnel SOP. Now, I intend to spend essentially the rest of the day today and tomorrow and then polishing it up over the following weekend or two and then I'll release it out to all of us here.
[149:30] We also have a few other SOPs that are being created. Confirmation page SOPs, DM ad strategy SOPs, and I believe we have a few others as well.
[149:45] Very excited to see you guys all for the Q3 mastermind we have coming up July 12th and 13th. And if you have any questions in between now and then, of course, you ping me and you let me know.
[150:00] Let's go get richer. Talk soon.
