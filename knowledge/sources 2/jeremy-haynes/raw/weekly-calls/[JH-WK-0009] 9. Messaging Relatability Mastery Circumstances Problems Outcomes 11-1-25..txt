"All right. So, weekly inner circle group call. I've noticed a consistency and y'all not understanding how simple messaging really is. Okay. There's plenty of different examples already in the weekly inner circle group call library on messaging that I'd obviously encourage you to go watch."
[00:15]
"What I'm going to try to do in today's video specifically is help you understand the three different ways that I think of messaging, which is circumstances, problems, and outcomes. Okay? It ain't tough. It ain't tough. It's a very simple process."
[00:30]
"And again, in today's call specifically, I'm going to teach you the framework for how I think with this process. This process is very helpful when you're thinking of ad ideas, when you're thinking of VSSL. Jesus Christ. When you're thinking of what to say inside of VSSLs, when you're thinking about what to say in webinars, when you're thinking about what to write in emails, when you're thinking about organic content, you just have to think with these three things. Circumstances, problems, and outcomes."

[01:15]
"So, let me start with this. Okay? Circumstances are over here. Okay? Their problems are also over here. The outcomes that they want are over here and what you sell them which is the bridge. Okay, the bridge. This is what you actually sell."
[01:30]
"Okay, so you don't ever have to actually talk about the bridge. Nobody gives a fuck at all about the bridge until they feel like you understand where they're currently standing and why they're standing there. why they feel stuck on one side. And you have to also be able to successfully articulate what it is that they think is on the other side of the bridge."
[01:50]
"Okay? They only care about what you actually sell, which is the bridge, when you have made them feel like you understand them. Okay? And to be clear and very very explicitly clear with you, they feel like you understand them when you successfully articulate their circumstances, problems, and desired outcomes to them."
[02:10]
"Only then do they give a fuck about what you actually sell, which again is the bridge to get from one side to the other. A big mistake that a lot of businesses make inside of all things, whether it's organic, whether it's paid, whether it's an ad, a VSSL, a webinar, landing page, copy, whatever the fuck it is, a lot of people just go straight for the bridge. Like people give a fuck about that."

"Okay? The only people who care about the bridge are people who are what's called in-market audiences. Okay? You can communicate a bridge straight away to somebody who already has a burning problem, okay? Okay, but you still to a degree have to successfully articulate the fact that you understand their problem at the least."
[03:00]
"Okay, so anyway, long story short, very important you remember, nobody gives a fuck about the bridge until they feel like they've been understood. Okay, so let me give you some very clear examples of this."

"So the first thing that you got to do is you got to think with a few different customer types. Okay. So, you have not just one customer. You generally have a handful of customers that are in a few different circumstances, problems, and desired outcome states. Okay?"
[03:30]
"To think there's only one is super fucking right off the bat. Absolute dumbass way to think is thinking I only got one type of customer. It's not true. Okay? Your ideal customer, even if you think you only have one, can find themselves with different circumstances, problems, and outcomes."
[03:45]
"So therefore, it's beneficial to break these down into categories. Okay, I'll come up with four on the fly right now just to give you an example. So let's use y'all. Okay, we'll use an inner circle member and how I think of when I go to shoot content or when I go to make a VSSL or, you know, when I go to make anything like that."

[04:05]
"And again, we'll we'll specifically think about it in the context of these three things. Circumstances, problems, and outcomes. So person type number one. Okay, let's use the example that we label this person the show rate person."
[04:20]
"Okay, one big thing that you guys see me constantly yap about professionally all the time is show rates. Okay, because show rates are a pressing issue. They're a very common thing that my type of client will deal with as a problem. Okay?"
[04:35]
"Now, the circumstances of that specific problem vary give or take what type of funnel they're running. So, as an example, they may have a call funnel, right? They may have a webinar funnel. And if they have a webinar funnel as an example, they may be dealing with show rate in two different ways."
[04:50]
"They may be dealing with the webinar show rate, but they may also be dealing with the call show rate on the back side of the whole thing. Okay? They may have something like a 3-day virtual event or just a virtual event in general. Okay?"

[05:10]
"And I'm just going to stop there just so I don't keep yapping. But here's the moral of the story. These are examples of things that they have going on, okay? Which can lead me to very specific circumstances and very specific problems and very specific outcomes that they'd have as a desire give or take which one of these specifically that we start to look at."
[05:30]
"Okay. So, as an example, they could have a few different things that start to occur. Let's break them down. So, first of all, the problems. Okay, the problems in this one are relatively obvious. They likely have a low show rate and sometimes the problem underneath the show rate category is also classified as they show up unsold, which they still technically view as a show rate related issue."
[05:55]
"Okay, so low show rate, they show up unsold. Okay. Sometimes another very specific problem that they think is the solution is to start doing things like double booking. You know, there are some people who have literally given up on their show rate improvement."
[06:10]
"So much so that there are softwares now that exist that are created by salespeople to double book solely because they feel like show rate isn't something that can even be solved. Okay. So, just to put this in perspective, okay, I'm going to keep going, but you can start to get an idea of like what we're doing here. We're kind of drilling down into very specific things that they're likely dealing with."

[06:35]
"All right, now let's go into some circumstances. Okay, circumstances are things that they currently perceive are happening to them or that have happened to them or just like how they view themselves positioned in a specific scenario or worldview."
[06:50]
"Another way to articulate circumstances in a simpler way is just to say perspective. Okay, this is like the perspective that they hold on on their on where they currently are in the process."
[07:00]
"So, as I mentioned, some of them have given up and seek software for double booking, which is crazy to me, but whatever. They view it as something that's that's worth doing. Some of them uh view it as a marketing problem and blame that person. We'll call it that department. Cuz most of my ideal people, they have a team, okay?"
[07:20]
"Not just one individual, but usually they have multiple. Okay? Some of them uh view it as a sales team issue. Their salespeople aren't compliant with best practices. We'll leave that with compliant. Their sales people aren't compliant with best practices."
[07:35]
"That would mean things like they've heard me in a video be like, 'Oh, you should have your sales people send selfie videos prior to the calls.' Or, 'You should have your sales people reach out and try to establish contact in a way that looks human instead of just all automation.'"
[07:50]
"And they hear those things, right? And they they look at their sales team and they're like, 'Oh, that's why my show sucks. You guys aren't doing what you guys need to be doing.' You know, like, fuck y'all. Okay. Now, obviously, I could keep going on and on and on, but I'm just going to stop here."

[08:10]
"Okay. Now, let's go over the outcomes that these people typically have. Obviously the desired outcome specifically in the context of show rate is improving the show rate and usually it's not like a little bit okay it's generally not like a 10% lift in show rate thereafter usually my demo wants like a 30 to 40% lift in show rate okay they want to see it go up big time and they're not wrong okay"
[08:35]
"um they in terms of outcomes obviously want more revenue, which is the whole point of trying to get people to show up in the first place. And it feels like, I want to be really clear when I say this, sometimes when I tell people like you need to do this exercise of listing problems, circumstances, and outcomes, you feel like certain things are too obvious."
[08:55]
"Those are typically great ones, right? But there's also things that you could do to kind of drill down on it further. And this whole want more revenue situation is one of them. So, let me be really direct when I say this."

"If you feel like you list something that feels too broad or sometimes you can also label it as like too surface level, try to go like a couple steps deeper into that same thing. Okay, so watch this."
[09:25]
"So want more revenue, we're going to label as surface level. We're going to label as something that we could go deeper on. What they actually want is more daily sales. What they actually want is higher ROAS. Tired of burning tired of burning money on calls that feel wasteful because no one shows up."
[09:45]
"Okay, so these things specifically if I if I find something surface level, I just want to keep digging into it. And I could probably dig into this another like three or four different ways. Okay, so anyway, here's my point."

"Now that I've got this little exercise done, keep in mind we got person type number one. I labeled person type number one is like my show rate person. Okay, so my my ideal client, my ideal customer, one specific thing that like that type of person wants is a higher show rate."
[10:20]
"Okay, it could be call funnel, could be webinar, could be three-day virtual event. Now, watch how I can take this exercise I just did and plug it into one of these three things. Okay, so here we go. Now, I'm just going to I'm just going to rap as though I'm like filming an ad. Okay, so..."
[10:40]
"You're running a call funnel. You want to see at least a 30 to 40% improvement in your show rate. You maybe even given up on the idea that your show rate can be improved and now you're seeking softwares that allow for double booking."
[10:55]
"Maybe you view it as a sales team issue because your sales team isn't doing the best practices that you know they should do. Maybe you view it as a marketing issue, right? Whichever issue it is and whichever department you view it as responsible for, it all comes down to this."
[11:10]
"You know that stat has to go up because you want more revenue. You want to get more daily sales. You want to higher ROAS. You are tired of spending money day in and day out to book however many calls are going onto your team's calendars and not having those people show up. It feels wasteful and you're not wrong for thinking that."
[11:30]
"And now I transition to the bridge because now they actually give a fuck about the bridge and that becomes the second half of the ad. Okay, that's when I unlock the bridge. Okay, so back to the ad."
[11:40]
"Okay, at that point I transition. You need to understand that in these modern times, back-end selling systems, which is a five-part process, you have to implement this whether you're running a call funnel, a webinar, virtual events, DM ads, low ticket to high ticket, where you want higher connection rates, whatever it is."
[11:58]
"The back-end selling systems is, and then I'd start to explain the process, okay? And then I'd end it with a call to action. So very important you understand everything in messaging always starts with circumstances, problems and outcomes. Okay?"

[12:50]
"Okay? Here's another one as an example. Person type number two that I could easily label would be need a new funnel guy. This type of guy thinks that they maxed out whatever it is that they're currently doing and they don't view it as more scalable than it is right now or maybe they've given up on the funnel and they want a new funnel."
[13:10]
"Okay, sometimes I could label person type number three organic only wants to do paid. Okay, you see where I'm going with this? Person type number four doesn't know how to scale. tried scaling, fails, always has to pull it back. No idea how to scale, but they want to scale, right? You understand?"

[14:45]
"So, when you're labeling the problems, you're trying to think of specific things that are keeping them stuck. Look at it like the word prevent is what you want to be thinking with. What's preventing them from getting what they want. What's the block? What's the wall they're running square into?"
[15:00]
"What what's the ceiling labeled as to them? Why can't they move beyond this current situation? List as many as you can. The more the merrier because you can you can do what I did in the example of the ad I told you. You can say them all. Okay?"
[15:15]
"Try to come up with at least two to three. Take another 30 seconds. If you run into a wall yourself of being able to think with more problems, go back to the label of the person. Right? Remember, anytime you get stuck, think of the person again."
[15:30]
"You've dealt with these customers before. You know them intimately. You're not just making this shit up. These are real people. There's a pattern in your buyers and you know it well. Label that person's problems. What's holding them back?"

"Are they limited on money to solve the problem? Is that a circumstance for them? Are they limited on time? And remember, if anything feels surface level, try to drill into it a little bit. Take it a step further. 30 seconds. You got this. This shit's easy."

I view it as a milestone outcome. And pretty much every single one of you whoever hits a million a month, as soon as I ask you, I'm like, 'Hey, like how's it feel?'

"No, fair question. So, when you when you are looking at ads, you think of an individual and you try to wrap off like we just did in that exercise.

Um, you know, one of the one of the lessons that uh Mr. Bencivenga had shared in a newsletter that I had found out about after he unfortunately had passed, which which I very very I kind of laughed when I saw it."
[53:40]
"you know, he was articulating just the simplest interaction I had with him at a mastermind where he was saying he was there in a little group of people talking and I approached him out of nowhere. He's he's like he said like, 'Oh, here comes Jeremy.' Uh-oh. And I I walked up to him and I was like uh right away. Didn't say, 'Hey, hi, hello.' I was just like, 'Ben, have you made more money?'"
[54:05]
"you know, because the last time I saw him, I was on his ass about getting richer and he had stalled for like a long period of time, and I just kept rotating my tactics to try to like eventually amplify him again. And I finally found the specific trigger that worked on him, which which was selfish motives. Okay?"

"And I should have realized this as like a young 20-something that Ben was that that would likely be the case. But anyway, his selfish motives at that specific time were he wanted a McLaren 720S. I also noticed his motives were he was tired of feeling small amongst his friend group cuz you know here in Miami all his friends and you know some of us in the inner circle that were great friends with him."
[54:55]
"Um he just felt small, you know, he felt small. He was tired of feeling small. And so I also found if I picked at him a little bit like he was like, 'Oh, I want a 720S.' I'm like, 'Why you only want the 720?' you know, like I got a 750, like you should be able to get a 750, too, you know, and feeling small was a motive. Okay, now here's my point."

"I'll give you a great one. Okay, so back to this show rate example. If I wanted to pour some gas on this fire, okay, and I looked at it specifically from an amplifier perspective, I would I'm just going to reiterate the ad as though it's from the top and then I'm going to I'm going to really emphasize the amplifier part. Okay?"

"So, I'm going to say your show rate sucks. Whether it's your call funnel, your webinar, your virtual event, whatever it is, right? You're fed up with your show rate being so bad. You You've given up to a degree. You're seeking softwares now that allow you to double book because you don't even view it as possible to get it higher anymore."
[56:35]
"Look, at the end of the day, it is possible to get it up 30 to 40% higher than it is right now. You deserve that revenue that you're missing out on. Yeah, you should get more daily sales. you should have a higher ROAS. Yeah. And listen, whether it's your marketers, whether it's your sales team, you know, obviously they keep blaming each other for it."
[56:55]
"It's you that ultimately gets screwed here because it's your dollars, okay? Your dollars being caught on fire. Have you ever looked, and this would be the amplifier, have you ever looked at how many calls you are spending money to get onto your schedule for your sales team in a month and quantified how much money you're wasting on people that literally don't show up."
[57:20]
"And instead of doing anything, you sit there and you just compare yourself to all these other people who also have sh I wouldn't be able to say the word shit who also have terrible show rates. And you think, I guess this is just how it is. The industry show rates are just this low now. This is just the new average."

"You know, deep down you couldn't be further from the truth in that conclusion. And for you to get to the point where you've capitulated, you've given up. You're so weak in your current mental state, is this how you always thought you'd be? You really concluded that there's no way to get it up higher."
[58:00]
"You genuinely are convinced you've tried everything that there is to do. I think you're wrong. Let me introduce my back-end selling systems to you and how we on average get show rates up 30%. Typically the worst people who do this get their show rates up 17% on average. The best ones see 30 to 40% lifts."
[58:20]
"Sometimes by only doing one of these five things they see that improvement. Right? It's like amplifiers are essentially trying to dig into an emotion that somebody can pair with what you're saying because what emotion does to a person is it gets them antsy. Okay? Emotion creates energy."

"Now, I want to be clear in saying amplifiers can kind of sound a little fucking and and weaken the messaging that you're attempting to communicate if they don't actually generate an emotion for the person that's hearing it. Okay? Like I'll give an example like the show rate example I was articulating. I just kind of made that one up on the fly."
[61:25]
"I don't think that was a great amplifier. Like I tried my best, but honestly I don't know if it generated a strong emotion. I doubt it would. Maybe for some people, but like probably not a lot. It's like, so to be clear, it's like an amplifier has to land. Okay? If the amplifier doesn't land, it's not worth having an amplifier."
[61:45]
"The only time that you'd really want to put an amplifier into what you're doing is if you know with certainty that like a very specific circumstance is top of mind for somebody and when they hear it or when they see it, but when they think with it, they're like, 'Fuck that.' You know? Okay."
[62:05]
"So, just to be clear, amplifiers are great to pepper in, but again, don't use them unless you actually know that what you're saying is going to create an emotional response in the counterparty. Okay? But great to use otherwise. Again, simply put, it's just pain slash like raw emotion, okay? And the key is it's typically emotion, okay? And it's generally never a positive emotion. Okay?"

"Like if Devon as an example is trying to sell his Roseanne SMS Zoom integration software, like I wouldn't really expect him to amplify in some kind of like raw fucking negative pain.

"You need a reliable SMS provider that integrates with Zoom webinars directly, is reliable, consistent, and never going to screw you over so your dollars are maximized.'

[67:25]
"It's towards the end of it all because like I said, the whole front the whole front part is you being able to successfully make the person that you're talking to feel like you actually understand. You're trying to identify that you're talking to that person at the beginning of all this. Okay?"

"The most powerful thing you can do is leave the bridge towards the end because again people don't give a fuck about the bridge until you've actually made them feel like you get where they are, what they want, why they're stuck.

You can start the ad with a call out like most of you did. But again, you don't have to say it so specifically."
[68:35]
"You don't have to be like, 'Hey, you make 400k a year and the government's taking 100k from you.' It's like you can just say you're in the top 1% now. Anybody who makes more than $400,000 a year is in the top 1% and you and I both know you're just a little cash cow for the government to squeeze every single fucking nickel and dime out of."

It might be the ultimate goal, but it's like remember the ultimate goal is pretty fucking far away."
[70:00]

[75:00]
"When you do this successfully that we just talked about, you'll have a far easier time getting in front of the right types of people on a consistent basis. You'll typically bring the right types of people through who are in the right frame that are more probable to convert."
[75:20]
"And these people will feel more understood. And as a result of feeling more understood, there's a far higher probability that there's willingness to convert in a shorter time frame. That's what people really want. They just want to feel like you actually understand their current circumstances, problems, and outcomes."
[75:40]
"If you do that successfully and you say these things out loud, it's really hard to fuck up the conversion process. It typically te's up like a really warmed up buyer. The only time that you generally fuck this up is if you bring in like surface level leads that are like low intent, who, you know, aren't really consuming any any of the messaging on the front end."
