Transcrição Completa: How To Manage Agency Costs

 

[00:00] [music] common mistakes agency owners will make sometimes while you're scaling, but more importantly when you're first getting started more frequently anyway is you will not be thinking with all of the costs that come with being in business.

 

[00:14] When I first got started, one of my biggest issues and something I've seen in other agency owners that come into the community here, especially when they're first getting started, is they're not considering all the costs that are associated with running a business.

 

[00:27] They're not thinking with taxes. They're not thinking with saving money for themselves personally and for the business.

 

[00:33] They're not thinking with the expenses. They're not thinking with the growth fund, meaning a fund specifically for growing the business and scaling the business.

 

[00:41] They're not thinking with an operating account. They're not thinking with the costs that it might take to go to events for education. You don't have an education fund.

 

[00:50] They're all different kind of costs much greater than just I'm going to close a deal and then expense whatever I got to expense.

 

[00:57] That was one of my biggest issues when I first got started. I closed a $5,000 or $10,000 deal. I just had shit I had to pay for.

 

[01:06] So, I would go pay for it and that would not cover the cost of everything else. That would still be a cost I'd have to incur.

 

[01:13] So, then it became a shell game. It became a game of, okay, well, if I close this $10,000 deal, that's going to cover this mistake that I made back here.

 

[01:22] And then in this deal that comes, I'm going to be able to cover the expenses from this deal right here.

 

[01:27] That is a horrible game to play. And it's a surefire way to get your business to collapse depending on how big of the shell game you end up playing.

 

[01:36] It's just a it's a moment in the future that will occur where the collapse happens where you unfortunately don't get the next thing to pay for the last thing that forces the collapse.

 

[01:47] So don't get involved in that game. Instead, do the math.

 

[01:51] Think first with all the different expenses you're going to incur, including things that are obviously going to happen like taxes, the things you got to expense, your personal money you need to make, and more importantly than anything else, the business's operating fund, right?

 

[02:07] Think with these different variables, do the math on what it's going to take, and this is going to completely reshape what you're likely pricing.

 

[02:15] Because if you still have not considered that high ticket pricing is the surefire way to keep yourself in business and grow your business at the highest success rate, this should do the math and figure out low ticket deals are going to fuck yourself and shoot you in the foot comparatively to high ticket deals, which will enable you to pay for all these things without a sweat.

 

[02:35] See you in the next video.
