[02:15] And the title of our class is actually quite fitting. We call it the keys to attaining a high share of wallet with your clients. Now, for those of you who have no idea, maybe this is a new term for you, but high share of wallet is something we're going to talk about in a little bit.

I got to bring these guys out because these two individuals are literally the boots on the ground, the guys that have really, really contributed and helped our closers.com business grow and thrive and flourish even amongst these very, very uncertain times.

 

[03:30] So for both of them, Stephanie and Raphael, they have managed multiple, multiple accounts across, I would say over 10 different industries. And each of these accounts are bringing in thousands and thousands of dollars every month, if not tens of thousands of dollars every month. So I just want to give a warm welcome to Stephanie and Raphael. You guys want to unmute and say hello?

[05:30] I don't know if I can top that introduction, man. I mean, you already did it very well. It's hard to do it. But yeah, I've been working very hard like many of you guys. And it's been a tremendous pleasure to be part of this incredible community. Very hard to find anything like that. I've never seen anything like this anywhere.

[06:15] Now, you guys, before we get started here, this term I've been floating around just on the title slide, and also you guys have probably heard of it somewhere, but let's go ahead and go over to the next slide. But it's called share of wallet. And before we get started here, I just want to, I mean, Raphael, just as an example here, if I were to ask you, hey, could I have a share of your wallet? How much money would you give me if I asked you if I could have a share of your wallet?

 

[06:45] Tough question, man, with these tough times. Let me think. One second. In times of corona, 100 bucks. 100 bucks? That's it? After all I've done for you in the last couple months? I was pretty generous, man. Come on, man. Times are tight. Times are tight.

NÚMEROS: Não especificado

 

VISUAL: Definição formal do conceito, explicação sobre gastos com marcas versus competidores

 

[07:30] Next slide here, Raphael will show them the simple definition is really the amount that a customer regularly spends on a particular brand rather than to the other competing brands. Okay. So it could be same category. Shang is asking in the same category or different categories. It could be the same category. It just depends on how you want to classify it.

 

[08:00] The reason I bring this to you is because I used to work for a company called Dell, Dell Computer. They make laptops. They do servers. They have services as well. I worked for their corporate sales division. And I wasn't a salesperson back then. I was more of an analyst. So I did a lot of projects around process improvement and things.

[08:45] So I got to see the inner workings of Dell's corporate sales. And this happened to be one of their most frequently mentioned metrics in terms of classifying accounts. Okay. So to give you an example, they would divide up their clients into three categories. One category would be called retention. Okay. That's a category where the clients are spending a large portion of their wallet.

 

[09:15] And we're talking about a wallet, like their budget for IT spend, a large portion of that is spent with Dell. Like we're talking 50% or more of their IT budget. And this is in hundreds of millions and account for us so that everybody here in the chat can understand the amount of work that was put in around account management for Global Invest.

[10:00] Definitely. When we started, it was not the same picture, the same structure, anything was built to be that successful as it is today. It was a long journey, a lot of experience and learning that I went through. It's really a good account that we, as you know, the trust that we built together is really high.

 

[10:30] This is for the account management. This is why an account manager is really important and a key role in an account because its principal responsibility is really to understand the client on the short but also the long-term goals. It's really to coordinate between sales, marketing, client, or even other department that is in the company on this account in the organization.

 

[11:00] And really, the mission is to grow and improve the client's account with strategy and seeing opportunities by, it can be by looking at data or many more. It's really all your work, communication, all those points that will help you to get to those level of trust that you can eventually upsell, cross-sell many solutions to the client.

[12:30] Yeah, no, I just, I know we've been trying to, you know, work on getting the revenues up, you know, with the sales team and stuff, but I've just been looking at these numbers and I can't make heads or tails. I mean, I don't see the team really getting any better at closing. And I just, I'm kind of, I'm at a loss of words.

 

[13:00] We haven't even exceeded 10% closing ratio for the last three months. So I'm a big concern and so is my partner. I'm not sure what your thoughts are at this point. What do you mean 10%? We did two bones to close last week? No, I mean, I get the reports too.

 

[13:30] I clearly like, obviously I look at the bank accounts and I also look at the closing reports. And I mean, what I'm seeing, I think you guys maybe had one week where you're closed at 12% closing ratio, but the rest of them were averaging anywhere from six to 7% per week.

[16:00] The pre-close. This is where the screening, screening the account is really important. Really, it's the first step to analyze and gather the information on the company background. What you're going to look when you do that, it's everything related to the sales history. You have to go really deep in the details to make sure that this is a good account, a good opportunity.

 

[16:30] You will analyze the offers, the sales, and the marketing process of this account. And with that, you're going to see if it's a great or a bad opportunity.

[17:45] And the third one that I was not aware before, but it's an amendment. And this, we can talk a little bit more about that. It's because when you're signing an agreement, it's not fixed forever. Sometimes you can make some tweak and change it along the way with the needs of this account.

And it starts to be exciting. Now you're going to talk about the offer, the opportunity, meet the team.

 

[19:00] First is the sales team. Does this account already have an existing closing team or you will have to find closers and do recruitment? This is the first part that is important because if you have to find the closers, that's another step you have to think about.

You're going to show your professionalism, your experience, that you're an expert by bringing all the things that are happening on the closing call.

VISUAL: Cenário de role play mostrando comunicação efetiva com dados, soluções proativas

 

[25:00] Ring, ring. Yes, hello Rich. Hey, Stephanie. I wanted to talk to you about the YouTube funnel. We've been running it for a few weeks now and I'm seeing the closing ratio going down. I'm curious to know if I may ask, how many of the budget have you allocated for this new channel?

 

[25:30] Oh, we're doing, I think we're doing roughly 2K per week. 2K per week? Yeah, we're spending almost 8K a month. I think it's great. Really, the new funnel, it will bring so many other opportunities for the closing team. I think it's really great.

 

[26:00] Have you experienced that before when you launched the first, the original funnel, when you launched it, like the amount of no-show and the quality of leads? How does it look like? Yeah, when we launched that one, I mean, practically it was me and my partner closing the lead. So we, I would say that, I mean, we probably had a good 18 to 20% closing ratio, but it did take time.

 

[26:30] Okay. And here what I was thinking of, do you think it would be great if we can come up with a new content? The teams came up with a lot of questions from the prospect with this new funnel. And the top three questions was really basic question about the offer. Maybe we can plug that in the current campaign, artist and funnel, just to make sure that, you know, they can have a little bit more information before jumping on the call.

 

[27:00] I see. So you think maybe taking some of these messages and pushing them back into the actual copy of the campaign to make sure that the prospects are identifying maybe more with the pain? That will be a great idea. Yes. And I will say because right now I have 55% of the call is really to talk about the offer itself.

 

[27:30] And I mean, if you want, I can share with you one of the recording. We have 60% of our call is this kind of call. And does that help you? Do you want some, I transfer you that call? Yeah, no, I mean, I think that, I mean, I don't necessarily need to listen to the call, but if you have a list of those key phrases or words that keep coming up on the calls, maybe those will be key words that we can use on the copy.

[28:15] And I would like to share some good practice that I developed along the way because I face many and many, many difficult conversations, not easy. But one thing that, one tips that I can share that always work is really don't be defensive on the beginning of the call, agree with them.

 

[28:45] And also own the ownership and responsibility of what you have not accomplished correctly. Just be, take responsibility on ownership too when it's on you. You don't have to redirect everything always, but sometimes you have to be aware that some can be part of your responsibility.

[29:30] Who ruined the cake? It was my cake. Look at that. That's horrible. That is so bad. Looks more like a donut now, Raph. It's deflated in the middle. Look at that, guys. So what does this mean? This is a metaphor for something that we live with day in and day out as sales professionals. We are the last guys to touch.

 

[30:00] So here's the metaphor. So think about these guys. So the company, it's a team of people that are in the kitchen and they try to make the best possible cake in the world. And they want to present it to a few of their guests who are such people. They love these guys and they want to look really good with these guests.

 

[30:30] What happens is that there are a few people in the kitchen. They buy the ingredients. They make sure they are the best ingredients or what they figure are the best ingredients. They throw them together. They get the recipe. They have all this setup, right? The procedure to do it.

 

[31:00] And once it's ready or once they start to mix it up and have it all ready to start to be cooked, you're the one. We are the ones who put it in the oven. And we are the ones who take it out of the oven and present it to the guests, the honored guests. That's what a sales professional does with a funnel.

If you don't do the due diligence that Rich was talking about, if we don't do the agreement statements that Stephanie was talking about, if we don't have the right team, all is doomed from the beginning.

NÚMEROS: 9 problemas principais

 

VISUAL: Lista preparatória para exercício sobre problemas comuns em account management

 

[33:00] So this is what we were talking about before. So we're gonna talk now about nine most harmful problems that we have found working with accounts day in and day out. Different types of accounts, different industries, different personalities, different teams, different structures, different things, right?

 

[33:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Problem #1: Poor Marketing - 4 Manifestations"

 

NÚMEROS: Menos de 10 appointments por semana = problema

 

VISUAL: Quatro formas de marketing ruim: Low Lead Volume, Low Lead Quality, Lead Score, Show-up Ratio

 

[34:00] Poor marketing. This could come in many forms and it could be like 10 forms, but at least these four we've seen a lot, a whole lot. The first one is to have low lead volume, low lead volume. What does that mean? This could vary because of the size of the deal.

 

[34:30] So if you have, say, less than 10 appointments per week per closer, I'm talking the guy who closes at the end, then you have a low lead volume or you have a lead flow problem. That's also another way of calling it.

 

[35:00] The second problem is a low leads quality. Low leads quality. And this is a key thing for us to understand because many people differ, there is quite a bit of an argument, what constitutes a good lead and how do you determine what a good lead is?

 

[35:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Lead Score Document"

 

NÚMEROS: Não especificado

 

VISUAL: Ferramenta de avaliação de qualidade de leads, disponível na área de membros

 

[36:00] So what we did is we created a document that is called a lead score, a lead score. So the lead score, I'm not gonna be able to share it here because it's just too big of a thing to go through, but we're gonna put it on the members area for you guys to review.

 

[36:30] What's gonna happen is what the score is for is that when you begin the relationship with the business owner or with the company that is contracting your services, you gotta understand whether they have a lead score or not. If they do have a lead score, then we gotta use it and we're gonna give you a template that you can use to compare.

VISUAL: História de horror sobre pivot de negócio, mudança de done-for-you para coaching, falta de social proof

 

[37:15] And at some point it will get to the point where it's like, okay, we are out. But first, have that meeting firmly, but with good intention, explain the situation and don't shy away from the facts. This is out of integrity. And I'm not saying you did this on purpose, but this is what we see and this is not what's happening.

 

[37:45] So this ad has to change. That is non-negotiable. This ad has to change. And so she did slowly work on making some changes. In this particular case, there were other things that were obviously not working. So what we finally ended up doing, should I mention statement of work? Yes, just no names, but yeah, everything else, of course.

 

[38:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Statement of Work Documentation"

 

NÚMEROS: Não especificado

 

VISUAL: Documentação completa de trabalho realizado, horas investidas, closes, qualificação de leads, meetings fantasma

 

[38:30] Sure. So what we ended up doing finally was with the closing team leader, we put together, and this leader did a brilliant job, we put together every bit of data that we could that plain as day illustrated all of the hard work that we had done on our side, all of the times that we had shown up, all the hours that we spent working on this woman's account.

 

[39:00] All of the closes, how many prospects were clearly not qualified for very obvious reasons, not any opinion, but based on facts, like for instance, they're in a country that she legally cannot serve, things like that. So that we presented all of the facts, including things like all the meetings that she ghosted us on, meetings that she had agreed to show up on and she just wasn't there and no warning or anything, things like that.

 

[39:30] So bottom line, we're showing in very, very objective terms, no opinions, remember no opinions, no excuses, we're not playing the victim, but it was pure facts, like this is how many calls, this is my closes and so forth. So she could see plain as day in a way that's as irrefutable as humanly possible that we've done our part and you have not done yours.

 

[40:00] And that conversation, of course, is a very touchy one, you have to handle it very carefully, very diplomatically and say, listen, we've talked about making these changes, these changes haven't been made. Unfortunately, we're at the point where we're not gonna be able to continue working with this account.

 

[40:30] Now, if something happened and she kind of came around completely, we might give her another chance, but that's extraordinarily unlikely in that particular case and sure enough, in that case, that's not what happened. So we exited that account and it was a great thing.

 

[41:00] Yeah, and a couple of things, I don't know if you guys noticed, but Buckley had a statement of work. Actually, he built a statement of work out of the data that he had been collecting for a while. So it's very important that if there is a situation in which you get to that point, you have the evidence to back it up, but you don't start building that when the situation gets bad, right?

 

[41:30] Correct. Yeah, you wanna have every time your client does anything that's out of line or that's just off, you wanna make sure you screenshot everything or keep all of your recordings, you know what I mean? And keep these things in a safe place where the client can't get to them so that you have that backup, as Rafael said, if you need it.

 

[42:00] Now, hopefully you never will, but you're protected if you do. And this is really for your own sake as well as for the sake of your team. Absolutely, and Johnny's saying something very important here. Even walk away with style because guys here, like yourself, you have an own personal brand if you're working with a company.

 

[42:30] And if you are part of a team that is coming in as a contractor, you have a brand to stand for. Even if you walk away, you gotta walk away as the professional you are. You presented to this person. Let's say there's a commission in the air and they do a back charge and you have to handle this with PayPal or with any other company. What are you gonna use? They will ask you for documentation. That's something that you could use.

[43:15] Well, setbacks. Thank you. Thank you. Awesome. All right. Next horror story, unproven offer. This is something that is very close to your heart, Richie. You wanna share with us what happened?

 

[43:45] Yes, this is a story that keeps giving. It's a story within a story. And actually, guys, I mentioned this at the beginning of the call. This is the account I was talking about that was originally offering, it was a digital marketing company, and they originally offered what's called like a full service digital marketing agency, right?

 

[44:15] So it was a done for you service, whether you had to create Facebook ads or write a set of emails, they would just do everything for you. And at the time we had signed up for the account and I was the leader on the account. It was apparent to us that we were closing for this digital marketing service, right? It was a high ticket close. Margins were there. The offer was nice. It was like a 20K offer, right? Something like that.

 

[44:45] And as soon as we got onto the account, we started training for it, the business owner decides to do a 180 degree pivot. What do I mean by that? He shuts down the whole agency. And he shuts down the whole agency because he wants to go into coaching. Okay, can you imagine that?

 

[45:15] Actually, we have Aaron. Aaron, happy to have you here. If you want to add color commentary to this, you're welcome to. Aaron was also on the account. He came in a little bit later, but at the very beginning, it was absolutely a done for you service. He did a 180 pivot and turned it into a coaching offer where he was going to coach people how to offer digital marketing services.

 

[45:45] And decided to change the price point a little bit and decided to create what's called like a trust funnel, a four stage funnel, and mimic it after the HTC funnel and things like that. So he did this. And at the end of the day, it was not a proven offer, right? Even though he was an expert, he had no social media presence. He had a nice funnel that he invested almost a month of time filming and crafting.

 

[46:15] But at the end of the day, has this offer been tested in the market? Nope, not really. And that's the deception. I would say that there's nothing we could do. We were, how many closers? We had like four or five closers on this team. And that is the situation. That is what happened to us at that point in time.

[47:00] So what would you guys do? What would you guys do in this case if you were the leader, not the closer? What would you do if you were the leader? Yep. Let's see. Let's see what kind of answers we get in the chat. Thinking time, guys.

 

[47:30] Dr. Choi says, I would do what Rich did. Okay, Aaron, you can't play this game, right? Everybody else, yes. If you ask Aaron, he'll probably tell you, he and I and everybody else on the team did learn a lot from the account. But I'm curious, what would the conversation look like for you guys?

 

[48:00] Beat him up? Minnesota, pretty far away. Couldn't find him. I'd have to fly out there. Why can't we close for his coaching business? Sean, that's a good question. We tried to close for the closing business, right? The reality is, is the offer wasn't proven. So there was at least probably another three to six months before we would have seen any solid closes.

 

[48:30] You know what an improvement offer is. It's basically, the client doesn't know what's gonna go on with the marketing. He doesn't know how much he's gonna spend. He doesn't know which channel is working the best, right? That's the situation.

 

[49:00] Let me read a couple of answers here. William says, have a call with the business owner and say that we might not be able to go off with doing this, okay? Have a heart-to-heart conversation with the owner. Okay, same answer. Let's see, contract needs to expand as you're also doing the first sale and the offer experiment, okay? He's talking about making sure that you're compensated for that.

 

[49:30] John says, I would immediately stop pursuing customers and have him address the agreement. Let's see, what else? Adam says, tell them, I respect your decision to change your business, yet we did create our working relationship on a different basis and the current conditions don't work for us this way. How can we help to make sure this becomes proven and workable? That's an interesting answer.

 

[50:00] Basically, they are now paying you for the zero to one experiment rather than closing a proven thing, Edward says. Okay, so Rich, what do you do? Man, it was hard because we had so many people on the account. I mean, to be honest, when you're put in a leadership position and you want to see everybody on your team fed and give them a fair shot at closing, it's almost the most difficult decision you can do because people are relying on this income, right?

 

[50:30] So tough decisions have to be made by leaders and that's what we did. We called on a stopping point. I believe it was a December timeframe, if I remember correctly, maybe like the second week in December, we said, if we cannot close, if you're gonna spend this amount of marketing, we're still not closing this new offer you've got, we are going to exit the relationship.

 

[51:00] And lo and behold, December came around, we were not closing, we used every single trick in the book. You can ask Aaron, we had really high quality scripts. We did like a- Yeah, maybe tell us a roundup of the things you did. So people, because it kind of sounds like we're exiting the relationship as a result, but it's not like that, right? We do things before.

[52:00] It's not, and I'm jumping to the conclusion just You're ready because I'm going to tell you a big punch. The closer on the team is superstar closer. They are performing like really, really well on other accounts, like really good closer on this account. This is where it doesn't match. Yes, that's the kind of situation that we are facing.

 

[52:30] All right, let's see. Okay, so you laid it out. So we have the team. You are the leader. You get a really good closer and you have this situation on your hands. What do you guys do? What do you do? Actually, maybe say that given some context about the price points stuff. So how much was the package?

 

[53:00] Yeah, it was a 5K package, mainly down sales. Something that I have to give. It's like creativity and the way I'm creating solution. But you cannot just create offer to create so many offers. You have to work on the marketing. If the first one doesn't work, you cannot just duplicate what doesn't work. But yeah, it was a 5K offer, coaching program.

 

[53:30] Okay, let's see what they say. Let's see what you get. Okay. Setting expectation up front. How many leads do they need to deliver? What's a qualified lead? Is it possible to effectively scale marketing? Okay, William is saying ask them what did they change? What's going on?

 

[54:00] Have a call, use the data and report it to them. Okay, have a call, use the data and report it to them. Tell them that they have a problem if they don't change. If they don't change, then get rid of the relationship. Bobby is saying have an open conversation and ask them if the closer is no good, how come he's producing awesome results in other accounts? Yeah, pretty good answers.

 

[54:30] Okay, let's see if we have somebody else. I would ask the business owner to involve themselves more in creating content that helps better educate and qualify and deliver on the right amount of leads for expected ROI. Interesting, but for this client particularly, everything is perfect. Marketing was good. I mean the materials, all right? So, okay.

 

[55:00] Tell us, Stephanie, what did you do? Yeah, this is a particular situation that we add the data, the reporting, the stats. And at this point, it was really we tried many things, right? I think, Raphael, you were part of that too at this point. And Buckley too. But this is a situation that we tried to bring a lot of solutions.

 

[55:30] And we even did more than just closing. Like we're trying to bring creative idea, help this client. But it was never enough. And the thing is, at this point, even if we tried to explain the situation, the first reaction was, no, no, no, this is not what it's supposed to be. Every lead, a little bit like the other story that Buckley shared. It's every lead are closable. Even the notion, even the cancellation, this is your job. You have to close everyone. Everyone is closable.

 

[56:00] Yes. And it just doesn't make sense. But at this point, there are so many things that was not working. Even if we came up with solutions, we tried to solve it. At this point, it was just like we have to end it. There was no other solution. There was no collaboration. It was not really a partnership. It was more like starting to feel like you own me, but we don't own. That was the kind of situation that was happening in this account.

 

[56:30] Yeah, and something that happened as well there, there was a key. And that was something that kept coming up on the conversations, right? We were saying, how come we haven't closed at least 50K if I'm sending you 20 qualified leads per week? Or how come we haven't closed 100K because I've sent you 100 qualified leads per week?

 

[57:00] And if you look at it, then how many people were actually getting on the phone? How many people did actually know what they were calling for? Very few. So that's where this third point comes into play. Words matter, guys, a lot. So when, again, when we start a relationship, what do they think is a qualified lead in their terms?

[57:45] What's a lead, actually? There could be more than one definition for lead. Is it the person who answers the phone? Is it a person who shows up on the phone? Is it just a name on a list? Now you know better because you've taken ultra UHTC, but many people don't. And there are so many names out there.

 

[58:15] And what does it mean to have a qualified lead? Can you get them to agree to use a lead scoring system and they can sign off on that and you can sign off on that and every marketing qualified lead, it's actually qualified by you and by them. Steph?

 

[58:45] Totally, yes. To come up with something like that. But, you know, sometimes it just doesn't work, right? Like when the qualification is not okay or done correctly, stuff like this happens. And sometimes for a marketer, when he's doing his own marketing, it's hard to say I fail, you know? They want to say everything is okay and we don't have anybody else to refer to in the company because it's the only one.

 

[59:15] And it's hard when it happens. But, yeah, we took a decision to end this collaboration. It was the best thing that we can do. We always check all the possibility before doing that decision. And in that case, there were no direction. It was the amount of work for the low quality of leads, the low volume, the anxiety, mindset game. It was not okay to continue. We took the statement of work and ended.

 

[59:45] What do you think would have saved the relationship? That's an excellent question. Do we check with the chat first with everybody? Let's see. What do you think would have changed the relationship and saved the relationship actually based on what you know so far? Let's see. It's coming up.

 

[1:00:15] Tell them to do what they did before. Okay. Lead metrics in the statement of work. Open conversations and alignment to understand the lead and marketing. That's a good one. Stephanie?

 

[1:00:45] Yeah. And I love what William said. That's something that we talk about. Like what was working and what is not working. We really go in all the directions possible. But I think here it was the expectation was not realistic. By example, you know, like saying my model worked like five years ago, four years ago, three years ago. The market changed.

 

[1:01:15] The prospects are more educated, sophisticated. They're on a change. You cannot keep the same model for X amount of time. You have to evolve, to grow, to adapt, change your strategy. It doesn't mean because it works two years ago, it's going to work again. And even with the new change of macroeconomics, everything that we're facing right now with COVID, no, you have to pivot fast, really.

 

[1:01:45] You cannot do the same thing, the same thing. But definitely here, what could have changed to make it work is really open conversation, understanding, not pointing finger, open communication, transparency, accountability, action, maybe like action plan. Okay, deadline, set expectation with a deadline.

 

[1:02:15] And just to follow that to make sure that, okay, we're going to work on this to make this situation happen before for the next eight weeks, let's suppose. And then just do a summary at the end of that to see if it's working or we're in the same position. So set the accountability right for a period of time and making sure that we hit a target during that time.

[1:03:00] Absolutely. Nice. Rich, I think you wanted to... I think I see Buckley with his hand raised. I don't know if Buckley wants to chime in here. Let's see. No, I think that was raised from a little while ago. So I can unraise. Sorry about that. No worries. No worries. You're good. You're good.

 

[1:03:30] All right, third big issue, lack of clarity, guys, lack of clarity. Questions are, what roles do you play in the organization? And what's the role that other associates with you, like with respect to your role playing in the organization? That is so, so important. And we're going to hear a story again from Stephanie about the coaching account.

 

[1:04:00] Yes. Lack of clarity. This is important also because when you're making decisions, strategy with the closing team, or even you want to understand what's going on with the marketing for the closing call, it's great to know what's going on on the marketing side and also in the business in the organization.

 

[1:04:30] Let's suppose a client wants to change the full offer, but you don't know it. It's important to know that, the clarity of what's going on. But an example that we can share today, it's another account. We got the weekly meeting with the client. It was always the same people on that call. But one day, random people show up and just jump on the call with the closers and the client and start asking questions like, oh, you do this, oh, you do that. Okay, tell me more. And just disconnect and leave.

 

[1:05:00] And after that, we're like, okay, who's that person? Oh, it's somebody. And the client said, it's just somebody for marketing. He's working on the project. Okay, we don't ask more questions. But another meeting, another people that we don't know about jump in and start asking other kind of questions. Oh, what about this? What about that?

 

[1:05:30] But it started to be weird. Like, okay, who's those, how many people are working on the marketing? Are they self people? And we started to look online, like during the meeting, like, okay, who are they? And it was so confusing. Like, we don't understand at all. And we tried to ask questions, redirect, but it was so not clear that after two or three times, like another meeting, another random people appearing asked for some documentation.

[1:06:15] Very well-established entrepreneur, and we had a good relationship. So for about one month, we were preparing the team. We made sure we went through all the steps, right? We did have good documentation to go through it, and we made sure that we had a good understanding of the product.

 

[1:06:45] We run through different versions of the product to make sure that we were aligned, that we knew what we were talking about, and we launched the... We kicked off the start of getting the calls, right? So what happened is that there was a group of SDRs, and they were setting up the calls, and we were having the bookings coming on.

 

[1:07:15] And finally, what should have been a good lead flow of about five, six calls per day per closer turned out to be more like one or two, and that was one. And the other problem was that for some reason, that happened for about a month, I think. No, not a month, maybe two weeks, two, three weeks. And then the calls were starting to ramp up. It was getting better.

 

[1:07:45] So we were having from two to three calls per day to four to five calls per day. So that was good. However, we couldn't close. So I think we did maybe two, three closes for the first three weeks that we were doing it, which is not zero, but it's not good either, right?

 

[1:08:15] So anyway, so for a while, we were asked to block out a part of our schedule to make sure that we were getting a certain amount of calls. Some were booked directly with us. Some of them were scheduled in advance, like for instance, two days before, right? But when we got on the call, prospects were particularly cold, and I experienced that myself.

 

[1:08:45] Sometimes I was going through different types of approaches to close, right? I was using the inbound marketing approach. I was using more like a downsell approach to make sure they knew the other offers. I tried many different ways, and so did the team, right? But they were not getting better at all.

 

[1:09:15] And for a while there, we had periods of time in which we didn't have any calls, but I was still going back to my recordings and trying to understand why wouldn't I close? So I would listen to it, and in the end, like after doing some, like trying to get my awareness right, or is it my closing skill that is a problem here, or is it just, you know, the whole situation? What is really the problem?

 

[1:09:45] So I was listening to my recordings, but I couldn't really find something that I was doing particularly wrong, and I was getting a lot of recordings. I had a lot of recordings. So either I was completely messing up the whole thing, and so was my team, or there was something else. So I needed to understand what happened, but at that point, I was already having the business owner on me like every week, right?

 

[1:10:15] Asking me why weren't we closing if we were supposed to be, you know, among the best closers in the world. So let's say, guys, that you find yourself in that situation. What would you have done? Let's see. Let's see what you got to say.

 

[1:10:45] Ask them about the process, how they get their leads, what is their foundation, et cetera. Okay, that's one answer. That's from William. Let's see. What objection is coming across all closers? Leads were cold, Mohamed. Leads were very, very cold, particularly in the beginning of the conversation.

 

[1:11:15] Patrick just wrote, adjust goals and manage expectation. Asking why are the leads not so friendly? And that's a good one, actually, John. And I did ask that, and the answer I got was, well, they shouldn't be. They shouldn't be unfriendly. They should be friendly because they know me, because they have been in my list for a while, and some of them have met me in person at different events. So I didn't really get an answer from him on that.

 

[1:11:45] Let's see. Ask if their lead got their USA or not because it seems like a problem being unclear on the marketing message. I'm not sure I understand that suggestion. Maybe say it in a different way. Bring up the challenges to the business owner, also saying what I have done so far for X amount of time, but it still didn't solve it, so I want to bring it up to your attention and see if there is something we can discuss, something else. Okay.

 

[1:12:15] That's a situation in which a communication can create a cliffhanger moment. I would focus on better educating and preparing the leads prior to getting on the call. I would even do an exclusive access to book a call only after a webinar training session. All right? Yeah, I like that. That's pretty close to what happened. Let's see.

 

[1:12:45] Qualify the leads. That's simple, but maybe you want to elaborate on that, Sonia. It's good. It's good, though. Unique selling advantage. Ah, yes. I got it now. Let's see. Let's see what else. Expectations were not communicated, right? Okay. Yeah, this is not an easy one, guys, because this is not as obvious as the other ones where the business owner says it's terrible, right?

 

[1:13:15] This was a good one, and there were leads that in theory were not bad, were not supposed to be bad. So what happened? What happened? Maybe even ask the client on the phone, are you here for more information or a deep dive into the program services? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Value not provided enough to audience. Hmm. Somehow, yes.

VISUAL: Processo de investigação via call recordings, descoberta de expectativas mal definidas pelos SDRs

 

[1:14:00] All right, so let's see. What did I do? So since we were not having, for a period of time, we're not having a lot of calls, and the owner was supposed to say, okay, so this should be good. Why aren't they happening? So what I did is I started, I found out that the system that we were using for recording calls was not just recording my calls, but it was recording everybody's calls, right?

 

[1:14:30] So I figured if they're recording my team's calls, that means that I can also browse from the whole company's calls. So I requested an access because I was curious about, there was something missing, right? So if the leads are supposed to be good on one side, but then when they get to me, they're cold, I was thinking there could be two possibilities.

 

[1:15:00] One, there was too much time between the moment they became a lead until the moment that we got on the phone. That was one possibility. Or there was something happening between the moment they were a lead and the moment they got on the phone that they didn't like.

 

[1:15:30] So what I did is I started searching through the records and I found that there were not old leads. They had been there for, let's say, less than a month. That's not really an old lead. Old lead is a year old lead, right? That's an old lead. So that was not the problem. The problem was in between the moment they became a lead and the moment they got on the phone.

 

[1:16:00] So what I did is I was using this system to start researching what was happening on the call with the SDRs because my team directly was not doing the SDR part, but somebody else was doing the SDR part. So I started listening to dozens or even hundreds of SDR calls. Many, many, many calls because many of them were like two seconds calls, four seconds calls. The longer ones were one minute calls.

 

[1:16:30] So I had to listen to many calls to find out that the expectations were really poorly set from the beginning. The first problem we had was that the SDRs were telling the prospects that the call was going to be with the business owner. The prospects were not asking for the business owner on the call with me or with my team out of politeness, I guess. They were polite and they didn't want to say that.

 

[1:17:00] But clearly there was a downer situation. It was disappointing for them not to be with the business owner who they met in an event before. They wanted to see the guy, the same guy, right, who was the face of the company. So that created a clear lack of a clear poor expectation for us.

 

[1:17:30] And you would think, right, so why are they doing that? The problem is that since we just started, the business owner had not properly communicated with the SDRs that a part of the calls were not going to be routed to him directly, but to us as a team. So they couldn't have set the expectation right from the beginning because the communication was not set right from the beginning for them.

 

[1:18:00] So as soon as we changed that, they started changing the speech. And once they did that, then basically the calls were starting to get warmer. That was one thing that we solved. The other situation was that from that research that my team and I did, we didn't find just one issue. We found like seven issues, different types.

 

[1:18:30] And you know, guys, because we've been doing STCs now for a while and you've practiced this in Ultra, they were not following certain standards. So in the end, what we did is we took on the responsibility of doing the SDR part. There was a lot of improvement on the quality of the leads.

 

[1:19:00] And that account, after that first terrible month, hit 100K in sales in about two more months. And we were able to grow the team and have two SDRs and three closers. So that was a really good turnaround for an account that really started so, so slow. So that is the lesson I wanted to share with you guys.

 

[1:19:30] This is very powerful. Yeah, I don't know if you have any comments there, Rich. That's a very good example of an account that was well managed from end to end. And with the ability to access the call data, I think that saved the day. I mean, imagine if you had a situation where you weren't able to listen to another team's recordings. You would never know.

VISUAL: Três soluções propostas para problema fiscal, negociação de termos de pagamento

 

[1:20:15] Right, for the business owner. And 20% of that would be what? Let's say the commission rate was 20%. That's 20K, right? So the closing team leader would, at the end of the month, send the bill to the business owner, 20K. Now, imagine the business owner, instead of paying that 20K, has to pay an additional $4,000 on top of that. Right?

 

[1:20:45] Now, if his finances are good, that might not be an issue, but in this case, he was kind of not happy with that. Felix is in, I love it, 50-50 split between closer and the business owner on tax. Love that. We'll talk about that in a second. Bobby's saying, negotiated 10%, delay in to be paid after 90 days. I like that. I like that idea too.

 

[1:21:15] Bobby says, this is why I have a dream team. Yeah, of course. Now, if you don't have a dream team, you might do it this way. You guys ready? Okay, so some of the solutions have been mentioned kind of here. So we sat down together with the business owner and we said, hey, let's have a conversation around this because we know on one hand, this account is doing well.

 

[1:21:45] We've been closing higher and higher numbers for this account every month. So we know that we want to make sure that this change is smooth for the business owner. So it turned out that we brainstormed a couple of solutions. One of them was to split exactly what Felix says, is to find a 50-50 split between the closer and the business owner, which would effectively affect the commissions of the team.

 

[1:22:15] So we take that 20% to try to carve out a portion of that. So effectively, if originally that team was taking 20% commissions, it would be less. That was one solution. Was the team leader happy with that idea? Not so much. Not so much.

 

[1:22:45] The second solution is related to what Bobby proposed. So when we talk about situations where the tax can be recovered through reimbursements and it takes three months, then we looked at using the time as a lever. So how can we delay payments? How can the business owner delay payments to the team leader in an equitable way, in a fair way?

 

[1:23:15] So we ended up on this solution. We decided that they would still bill for the additional 20% on the invoice. But instead of the business owner having to pay immediately, we waited it out. We said, hey, instead of paying us immediately, you can delay it for 30 days if that helps your business cash flow.

 

[1:23:45] So the business owner could pay the team leader at the end of the month instead of at the beginning of the month. So the client was actually happy with that solution. And that's where we landed on the solution development. Nice. Good stuff. All right. Now you guys know how could you handle a situation like this.

 

[1:24:15] It doesn't necessarily have to be in the UK, but taxes are everywhere, right? And more and more, if you're not an employee of the company, it's probably something that you're going to have to handle by establishing your own corporation and coming as a contractor. Same if you have a team of closers, same if you're working for a closing company like Closers.com or something like that.

 

[1:24:45] So this is something you have to account for in the beginning of the relationship. Or if you can't, or well, it shouldn't be the case since this class, but if you can't, then you can use Rich's experience for that. Bogdan's solution was also there on the table as well. He says pay 75% upfront and then 25% at the end of quarter.

 

[1:25:15] We thought about that. We thought about actually even for the team that was closing with holding part of their commissions until end of quarter and just kind of give it to them as more of like a bonus because with holding at the front end, it's got to trickle down all the way down to the closer. So we did have that option as well, Bogdan, but we didn't choose that one. So good creativity there.

 

[1:25:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Problem #6: Lack of Reporting - Metrics Framework"

 

NÚMEROS: Target $100K/mês, 40 units × $2.5K, 200 kept appointments, 20% close ratio, 333 booked, 60% show-up, 1,665 MQL/mês

 

VISUAL: Framework matemático completo de reverse engineering, cascata de métricas do revenue ao lead

 

[1:26:00] Yeah, good stuff. All right, let's keep going guys. Problem number six, lack of reporting. All right, we got to speed up the presentation here guys. Otherwise, we're going to stay here like as long as Sifu stays. All right, lack of reporting. This is a no brainer, absolutely no brainer guys, particularly if you are managing a relationship, a long-term relationship with someone.

 

[1:26:30] You can have lack of reporting is such a big problem that could end up you not knowing if you're working for the right account or have a business owner that is blaming you for something that you really have nothing to be blamed for. So that's a bunch of problems. Here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to give you something that it's a common problem among us and that you don't want to find yourself in this situation.

 

[1:27:00] So what is happening a lot is that usually the relationships are built on target revenue. So the target revenue goal is super clear, but the rest not so much. So what we're going to do here is we're going to go through a bit of a few numbers that you want to account for when you're talking about what numbers to track.

 

[1:27:30] And if the company, again, if the company is tracking those numbers, great. Make sure that you can use these to understand whether the levels or the ballpark numbers that we're using tell you if the situation is good or bad. Or if they are not tracking it, you can start building a report that tracks these numbers because they're very important. Okay, so let's dive right in.

 

[1:28:00] So the target revenue number can become a number of sales units times the package size that you're handling, which can translate into a number of kept appointments times the closing ratio that your team is producing, right? Now you have to average this out if you have more than one closer or you are part of a team and you need to manage these numbers.

 

[1:28:30] That translates into a number of booked appointments and that translates into a lead flow. So all the way from the moment that you establish a target revenue, you can trace that back all the way to the lead. These are important metrics that you got to keep into consideration.

 

[1:29:00] So let's look at an example because you guys need to know what usually are numbers that you can handle here. And for simplicity, I know we're talking ultra here, but for simplicity, I just used easy numbers to calculate. Let's say you're looking for a target revenue of 100K a month. 100K a month. And you're selling a product that is only 2.5K. Okay.

 

[1:29:30] And you want to, which means for you that you got to be closing 40 units on that month at 2.5K. All right. That means that you have to have in your calendar 200 kept appointments at a closing, at a 20% closing ratio, which is the same as saying 333 booked appointments at a 60% kept appointment ratio.

 

[1:30:00] Which translates into a lead flow, at least an MQL of 1,665 leads per month. These numbers are numbers that we can see on different accounts that you can use to tell a couple of different stories. First, track the numbers and know that you have to reverse engineer all the way from the where's my money question, which doesn't really tell the story to something like this.

 

[1:30:30] So if you're Stephanie and you were in the role play before, then you would say, Rich, hang on one second. What are you talking about? So, oh, okay, the revenue is down or the closing rate is down. Let's look at this report that we have in front of us. And you break it down for them and you say, you know what, Mr., you know, Rich, actually the closing ratio is not too bad. Why is that?

 

[1:31:00] Because look at the number of kept calls that we had. People are just not showing up on the calls. So that's a problem. So then the problem is not here. We got to go one step back or one step back or one step back. And you may end up having a conversation about the marketing or the lead flow. Does that make sense, guys? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, okay. Yes, I like this.

 

[1:31:30] Okay, so one thing that you have to account for is these percentages are for packages that are, we're talking about here that it's a lead flow that feeds people on a weekly basis, right? We're not talking here about, say, a multilateral agreement between corporations that requires three, four months to run. And we're talking here about mid-size package deals, more or less.

 

[1:32:00] But if we're not hitting these numbers, right, if the kept ratio is under 60 or under 50 or under 40, that's a red flag. The closing ratio is under 20%, that's a red flag. If you're not closing consistently four units, you're not going to hit 100K. If your qualification process for the leads is bad and really on the number of leads, it's not coming through these at a 10% ratio at least, that's a red flag.

 

[1:32:30] Then that means you need more ad spend, right? Or the qualification process is alienating people and not getting them through the funnel. So I know this kind of sounds like marketing, but not really, guys, because it is part of our responsibility. We are the ones holding the cake. We got to make sure what the hell did they put in the cake so we can bake it properly. Yes? Yes, yes, yes.

 

[1:33:00] Okay, use these numbers, guys. Use these numbers. Rich, anything to add here? You've been looking at numbers since forever for this account. Yeah, no, I was just saying if you aren't a numbers person, and actually I'm not a numbers person myself, I'll be very honest with you guys.

VISUAL: História de horror sobre esquema MLM/pirâmide, consulta com Sifu Dan Lok, FTC issues

 

[1:33:45] Says, is this something that you left out on purpose or something that you thought to leverage to pull us under when it surfaced? I think we've got a lot of votes on that one. Okay, so let's see. What did you do?

 

[1:34:15] Okay, so during the confrontation, I told you guys we confronted the business owner. We decided to start with the numbers first. Okay, so we started with the numbers. Now there's obviously there's something in addition to the numbers not working out. There's something funky about the way we're pitching it.

 

[1:34:45] So we decided to confront those numbers first and bring it as a financial issue in the beginning. And then we moved on to some of the ethical messages, the concerns that we had with the ethics, right, of it all. And it wasn't us that actually brought up the FTC issue. I think it was Ditas who did.

 

[1:35:15] So it was only because Ditas had a direct relationship with the business owner. So she decided to bring that up. But all in all, it was a progression. So we started off with kind of the more harmless stuff, which is the finances don't add up, right? Somehow they don't add up.

 

[1:35:45] So we brought this up to him and he tried to explain and defend and try to convince us that it does add up. All you got to do is run it for a couple of months and everything will work out, right? So a lot of like justification there. And then from an ethics standpoint, I think there was a lot of justification as well saying that the company had nothing, the previous company has nothing to do with this current company. Okay?

 

[1:36:15] Now, we were very concerned. But by the way, by the way guys, we got a free call through courtesy of Bronson. Bronson had a free call with Sifu, consultation call. So the three of us sat on the call. He invited Ditas and I to sit in on his call with Sifu and we consulted Sifu on it.

 

[1:36:45] And Sifu told us, asked us a couple of clarifying questions. And just very, very briefly, Sifu just said, you know, get away from this deal as soon as you can. Wow. And in his words, Sifu said, I wouldn't touch this deal with a 10-foot pole. Wow. I wouldn't touch this account.

 

[1:37:15] So he basically said, you know, I advise you guys to go ahead and leave the account, right? And there will be other opportunities. And the main reason behind that was behind the ethics of it and him actually being tainted with the previous FTC history. Yeah.

 

[1:37:45] So don't think, so there's another hidden lesson here is when, if and when you are closing for an account like this, which promises the world and you don't have anything to fall back on, like for us, we put all our eggs in this basket, right? We did all the training for almost two and a half, three months and we decided to go full force, create a team and try to close for the account.

 

[1:38:15] If you have nothing to fall back on, it's very scary, right? Because you don't know if you give up this account, maybe you could still make money if you stayed on the account, but if you give up this account, then you have to do the whole thing over again. So from a mindset perspective, you have to be ready for that as well.

 

[1:38:45] Well said. Well said. And Bronson is saying, I believe I was able to calculate that for the numbers to work out, we would need between seven to eight billion people to sign up by the end of two years, requiring us to find more projects off the planet. See, that's the thing. So it's absolutely right. This is crazy.

[1:39:30] Now, if we go back to this slide that we were viewing together, not this, but this, that's exactly the reverse hearing we're talking about. The question is, when do you guys do this? You're going to wait, right? And have months or something like as bad as an FTC regulation or report come up?

 

[1:40:00] Or is it a red flag already by the moment we start working and you have the first interview on the pre-launch, as Stephanie was talking about? So this is very, very important. It could save you lots of time. Okay. Horror story number seven that has gone.

 

[1:40:30] All right. So yeah, we got to make sure that you know the market. What are the fundamentals of the market? What kind of competition you're talking about? Is it a dog-eat-dog situation where you're in? What kind of competitors do the company you work for have? What are the industry standards?

 

[1:41:00] For instance, are you working with special regulators or special standards for different industries? Pharmaceutical, for instance. Communications have different standards as well. Electronics have different standards. Software have different standards. You got to make sure that you know what you're accomplished. You need to comply with.

 

[1:41:30] And also the government regulators and see what kind of reports FTC... What about the Better Business Bureau, Rich? Is that something that you also review or we should also advise to review? You can certainly do that. Some of the newer businesses, I would say, I mean, we're typically avoiding the super new ones anyway.

 

[1:42:00] But definitely the newer businesses sometimes are not registered on the Better Business Bureau. But any established business should have a rating on there for sure. I would check that as well. Certainly LinkedIn profiles, activities, engagement and traffic on the website, things like that also help to produce a case to say, hey, this company is actually a company that does good business and has been doing good business for a long time.

NÚMEROS: SMBs com menos de 50 empregados

 

VISUAL: Quatro pilares críticos: SOPs, Training Materials, Call Recordings, CRM

 

[1:42:45] Yep. Yep. Well said. All right. Keep going, guys. Almost there. All right. Let's do it. Let's do it. All right. Problem number eight, lack of documentation. So many problems here we've had, particularly with these four pillars, I would say. And these can be four things that we need to use in different ways.

 

[1:43:15] So I'm just going to run through them, guys. No horror story for this one. But we're going to ask you to please, when you do your due diligence and you have to use these nine problems that we're giving you to do your due diligence, make sure that you have a checklist for this. All right.

 

[1:43:45] A red flag, not having SOPs. SOPs or standard operating procedures are super important for you to know what to do. For instance, a relationship can break if, for instance, you are supposed to be doing something, but you're not. How would you know unless that you have the business owner next to you?

 

[1:44:15] And even then, how would you know what you're supposed to do and what you're not supposed to do if the company doesn't have good SOPs? Initially for sales and marketing, but then for operations as well. How do you transition a customer after you're done with the close? How do you handle the personal data for the customer?

 

[1:44:45] What do you do with the credit card numbers once you have them? What do you do with the data of the recording, of the call recording? All these are SOPs. You need to know how do you handle that information. It's super important. It could happen that you are not following a procedure, but you just don't know because there is no documentation for it.

 

[1:45:15] No training materials. And this is very common as well, particularly for companies that are SMBs with under 50 employees. No training materials have been created because there was no need for it. There was just a bunch of people that were in the same place and talking to each other. Well, that's not happening anymore.

 

[1:45:45] First, either because you are working in as a contractor or because for COVID-19, everybody's working from home, right? And we need to get contractors. So those training materials must be there, particularly if they have a product that is complex. So think SaaS, for instance, requires absolutely different layers of material training.

 

[1:46:15] So it will help absolutely with your closing ability, but also when you're selling, making sure that you are actually not promising things that are not available, right? So that's number two. Number three is no call recordings. This is something that probably can be tied back to the other problem of not having a proven offer.

 

[1:46:45] If the offer has not been sold, what recordings are you going to be having? None, right? And if the business owner says that you are having a lot of issues to close, then how do you know it's yourself and not the offer, for instance? How do you know what are the most common objections that you get?

 

[1:47:15] Of course, if somebody was closing before you, you need to have the call recordings. If, for instance, there is a situation like we were talking about before that you have a closing team that is leaving the company and you're coming in as a quote-unquote rescue team, right? Even if they don't like them, even if their relationship is broken, you want to have the call recordings.

 

[1:47:45] You need to know what the problem was, so you want to listen it for yourself. It's not enough that you get on a call with the business owner and you ask them, why are you firing these guys, okay? So far, so good. Are you following, guys? Yes? Okay. Okay, let's keep going.

 

[1:48:15] So no CRM. That's another problem. And before we didn't think that was a problem, it turned out to be a problem. Like after so many accounts, after so many problems that we have, not having a CRM is a big problem. Even with having all these previous three components, not having a CRM is a problem because a CRM has something special that the other three don't have.

 

[1:48:45] What is it, guys? What's a CRM good for? Automation, yes. Yes. Customer history, yes. Statistics, tracking. Paper trail, Sonia, you got it. It's the paper trail that we're interested in, particularly for this point, right? CRM is great, no question about that. It has many

[1:49:30] Expected to be as consistent on a daily basis or you make any of these mistakes of not talking to anybody or not role-playing with a closer that is much better than you, then you're going to start doubting your skills. You're going to start doubting yourself or your ability to close.

 

[1:50:00] And that creates anxiety, which is fear of what's going to happen in the future. And that is just a no return game that you don't want to play. Stephanie, you have some good insights on this. I'm going to let you please chime in.

 

[1:50:30] Yes, the anxiety is really, it can damage a closer mindset or the team. Really, when we talk about the coaching business that we got superstar closers there, and suddenly not only the marketing, but the anxiety was there too. It affects a lot. Like the people, the closers were asking questions about themselves. Is it me? Do I do enough on this team? What I'm doing wrong and start to affect elsewhere. This is really dangerous for closing team, definitely.

 

[1:51:00] Yeah, yeah. I think one of the older accounts, I think it was Florian as well, right? We had some situations like that as well, that the team was irregular closers or the closing got irregular, but we managed to overcome it with a little bit of this type of techniques, right? Totally, yes. Yeah. Rich, any experience you want to share here?

 

[1:51:30] No, I think you guys pretty much covered it. All right, let's keep going. So, okay, so let's say that it's not you, it's everybody in the team. That's another type of problem. That's a different type of problem. And this is a very important distinction that you want to take into consideration, guys.

 

[1:52:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "4 Factors Affecting Whole Team Performance"

 

NÚMEROS: Não especificado

 

VISUAL: Quatro fatores: Marketing Changes, Macroeconomic Changes, Seasonal Changes, Client Satisfaction

 

[1:52:15] So if it's a whole team, then it could be one of these four things. And again, this is something that we've seen happening, okay? So the first one could be marketing changes. And it goes back to communication, right? If you know a marketing change is coming, your expectations are going to be different, right?

 

[1:52:45] You're not going to have the same closing ratio as you were having before. If you're having a new offer that is improved, your expectation is different. So marketing changes are usually the number one thing that affects the closing ability of the whole team.

 

[1:53:15] The other one is macroeconomic changes. And this is pretty simple, but you got to understand that sometimes it's as big as COVID-19, and everybody knows it's in the news, and sometimes it's not as obvious because the industry is changing, because maybe Facebook is cracking down on different ads that were very successful before, but not so much anymore.

 

[1:53:45] Maybe the landing pages that they're using are using copy that is too direct, and Google and Facebook are not drawing people to that landing page anymore. All these problems that are bigger to the industry are also affecting the team performance.

 

[1:54:15] The other one is seasonal changes. This is particularly prevalent in new accounts that you don't have a year with, right? So how do you know? How do you know if October is a good month or a bad month? How do you know if April is a bad month or not? So you don't know.

 

[1:54:45] Ideally, what you want to do is, again, not just talk to the business owner and take his word for it or her word for it. You want to go back to the documentation. You want to go back to the CRM. You want to go back to the reports that they have for the year. You can see the year-over-year monthly sales. That's a very important metric to consider on these seasonal changes, year-over-year monthly sales.

 

[1:55:15] And then make sure that you can look at the numbers that they had before and compare it to what you have at a given month. And fourth is client satisfaction. Why is this important? Because client satisfaction draws from... It's a little bit farther off from the marketing and sales part, but it's very important because if you are delivering a solution to the team, to a group of people, and you are basically just promising something that they are not being given, then that's going to come back to the referrals.

 

[1:55:45] Come back to complaints and maybe bad reviews on different sites. It's going to hurt your social proof, the status of the company, and that's going to be a big mess. So that's some of the things we've seen. All right, and with that, those are the nine things, guys, that we have gone through, nine issues, nine big problems that we've had, we've experienced.

And with that checklist, you can use it to, as early as possible in the relationship, understand whether you're working, you're going in a game that you can win or you're just playing a losing game.

NÚMEROS: Zero custo de marketing

[1:57:15] All right, cool. All right, Steph, back to you. Yes, the last phase, phase number five. Maybe now you understand better why each phase, a different phase of an account is really important. With all the scenarios that we bring up, how much it's important in the pre-close, the first phase, to do the screening, to not came up with crazy people, like the story that Bakke was sharing, or accounts that are not a good fit.

 

[1:57:45] And all those important steps that you have to follow to make sure that you can prevent that. How much important it is to set the foundation in the pre-launch phase, number two, create your sales playbook, getting the information. And after that, the phase three, to meet with the teams, the clients, and to set the expectation, planify the recurrent meetings and ongoing conversation to build that trust.

 

[1:58:15] And after that, with all the situation happening, this relationship building brings you to the last phase, number five, upsells and cross-sells. This is important. When you have that trust, you have your frame, you have shown what you can do, your trust advisor for this account, you bring a lot of value, you know by heart the pain point, the challenges.

 

[1:58:45] You can see like a 360 degree about the account, you know that account very well. And it's a great opportunity to talk about upsells with the clients and cross-sells. I have a great example for this one. Actually, does every one of you know what's the difference between upsells and cross-sells? That's in the chat. What is the difference between upselling and cross-selling?

 

[1:59:15] Writing? Yes, I see a lot of people writing. Enrolls, come on. I just saw that in the chat. Upselling on the same program, higher level. Cross-selling different program, same company. Bogdan. Adam, upsell some more or better version of the same. Cross-selling, sell something different. Yes, different but complementary. This is really important.

 

[1:59:45] Yeah, Adam's got it. Got it, yes. This is perfect. Okay, then there's many way you can do that on your accounts. And I want to say why it's important because it can create more revenue for your account with no marketing cost. It can be increasing the price. It can be adding more offer, more upsells, more downsells.

 

[2:00:15] There's many things you can do that will not cost any money for the marketing. And this is also like a win-win situation because you're going to benefit from that. The client will benefit from that. The prospect will benefit from that. Everybody will win in that situation.

 

[2:00:45] And because the trust is built, you have a good relationship with the client and the account. And there's a higher chance that the client will say, yes, let's do this. I trust you. You know pretty much my accounts and you have built this relationship with him. Also because you see all the problems on a daily basis, you know exactly what is the next step to make this account more performance and also growing. This is a great way to do it.

 

[2:01:15] All you can solve situation with upsells and cross-sell. Would you like to add anything to that, Rafael and Rich? Just to answer one question, there's no cost. So what this means is cost of acquisition for a high ticket offer usually goes about 10, 20, even 30% of the price.

 

[2:01:45] And so if you're selling to your existing customers a new product that is related or is an upsell, then you basically don't have any marketing cost to acquire that customer. After all, you did spend the time to acquire the customer and build the trust and maintain that trust throughout your whole life cycle, your whole account management phase.

 

[2:02:15] So all of that investment pays off because all you got to do is when the opportunity arises, have a conversation with the customer and see if you can provide a solution to the problem. Yep. Exactly. Yes. And one of a great example that we have for this is the real estate account that we have.

 

[2:02:45] And this account is really, we start from zero. Zero, I mean like there was a base, a foundation, but a lot of things need to happen to make it more successful. And after knowing this account, like from the beginning to the end, we were stuck. It is silly. It was not possible to continue to move forward or to improve this account. It was stuck.

 

[2:03:15] And I knew the solution was to do something different. And this is what I decided to do. It's having a conversation, talk about the challenges, what we can do. And before I talk about that, you have to know really well your clients. Like is he a Ruby, enrolled pro? This is important because you want to, it's like a closing call.

[2:04:00] You want to address this conversation like a closing call and make sure you know how to talk to him, this person to make your point and to close him on this idea. This is important. And on this account, actually, I really knew that he wants to go faster and slides back up, we just have a couple more.

 

[2:04:30] And I want to just say, as he's pulling it up, it's really great to see the fruits of your labor. Like if you're really good at managing the account, and remember, the relationship never stops at the sale, right? Always remember that, especially if you're delivering an ultra high ticket service or product, the relationship never stops just at the sale.

 

[2:05:00] And this is what Stephanie and Raphael and Buckley and the rest of the team have been doing for our accounts and really managing that relationship, managing those expectations so that these accounts can become successful. And this is what we want you guys to do for your accounts as well, where it makes sense.

 

[2:05:30] Okay, so does share of wallet make sense now? Hopefully it does. And hopefully it becomes a relevant part of your vocabulary as you close bigger and bigger deals for large accounts. All right. And also, if I may add, make sure to go through these big issues that we've been facing guys and use it to your advantage to make sure that you don't get into the same amount of issues that we did.

 

[2:06:00] You learn from our experience and not just lose a bunch of time and money into this. It'll save you at least six months of time for sure. Yep. For sure. Yep.

 

[2:06:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Homework Assignments"

 

NÚMEROS: 2 tarefas principais, 6-9 meses economizados

 

VISUAL: Duas tarefas: 1) Role plays de conversas difíceis no Discord, 2) Lista de áreas de melhoria para clientes atuais

 

[2:06:45] All right, just a couple of very simple homework assignments for you guys. If you are currently in the market for serving a client, a high ultra high ticket client, or you actually already have those clients already, go ahead and get back into the discord server, right? Pair up with some people.

 

[2:07:15] I saw a couple of you guys reaching out to me for some role plays. I may show up on the server at some point to role play with you guys, but practice some of these difficult conversations. It's not easy when somebody comes to you with a complaint, right, about performance. It's not easy to bridge expectation gaps where there is some kind of mismatch at the very beginning.

 

[2:07:45] So practice those specific situations over and over, just like your regular closing until you have those down path. Okay, so that's one exercise. The second exercise, if you're already working with clients, make sure you create a list of areas where you can improve.

 

[2:08:15] And also what are those actions? Like we showed you a whole list of examples where you can take action and discover the opportunities within those challenges. So what are the actions for your current clients based off tonight's class that will result in a better experience for them, better account management, and ultimately a higher share of wallet?

 

[2:08:45] Okay, so those are the two big assignments we have for you guys. We hope that you had picked up at least a few key points from tonight, but this will obviously be back up in our library for you guys to review. Rafael, do you have anything to add?

 

[2:09:15] No, we got it. It was a super long class, but I'm sure people actually let me ask you guys, did you get value from this? Okay, now do you know, can you tell a good account from a bad account using the nine big problems that we've seen working with so many accounts? Awesome. Awesome. We're happy. Awesome. That's great.

 

[2:09:45] With that, we'll leave you with the words. You guys are closer than you think.

 

[2:10:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Closer Than You Think"

 

NÚMEROS: Não especificado

 

VISUAL: Mensagem motivacional final, logo UHTC, encerramento da classe

 

[2:10:15] All right, awesome. So before we wrap up here, I just want to make sure, does anybody have any burning questions that they want to ask before we close out? Let's see in the chat. Any final questions, guys? This is your opportunity.

 

[2:10:45] I see some thank yous coming in. You're welcome, you're welcome. This is what we're here for. We want to make sure that you guys are equipped with the right tools and the right mindset to go out there and really crush it with your accounts.

 

[2:11:15] William is asking, what's the best way to find high quality clients in the beginning? That's a great question, William. I think, Stephanie, do you want to take that one?

 

[2:11:45] Yes, absolutely. So William, in the beginning, the best way to find high quality clients is really through your network, to be honest. It's the people that you already know, the people that trust you. And also, you want to make sure that you're positioning yourself as an expert in your field.

 

[2:12:15] So that means you need to be active on social media, you need to be providing value, you need to be showing that you know what you're talking about. And when you do that, people will start coming to you. And also, don't be afraid to reach out to people. Don't be afraid to send that cold message, that cold email.

 

[2:12:45] But make sure that when you do reach out, you're providing value first. You're not just asking for something. You're showing them that you understand their business, you understand their problems, and you have solutions that can help them. That's really the key.

 

[2:13:15] And I would add to that, William, is also making sure that you're very selective in the beginning. Like we talked about tonight, the due diligence phase is so critical. So even if you're hungry and you need to close deals, you still want to make sure that you're qualifying these accounts properly.

 

[2:13:45] Because if you take on a bad account in the beginning, it's going to set you back months. It's going to destroy your confidence, it's going to destroy your team's confidence. So be very, very selective and make sure you're following that checklist that we gave you tonight with those nine problems.

 

[2:14:15] Excellent point, Rich. And I see another question here. Bobby is asking, how do you handle a situation where the business owner is not responsive to your communication attempts?

 

[2:14:45] Oh, that's a good one, Bobby. So when a business owner is not responsive, first thing you want to do is you want to document everything. You want to make sure that you're keeping track of every time you reach out, every email you send, every call you make. Because that's going to be important if the relationship deteriorates further.

 

[2:15:15] But the second thing is you want to try different communication channels. Maybe they're not responding to email, try calling them. Maybe they're not responding to calls, try texting them. Maybe try reaching out on LinkedIn or other social media platforms. Sometimes people are just more active on certain channels than others.

 

[2:15:45] And the third thing is you want to make sure that when you do communicate, you're making it very easy for them to respond. So don't send them a long email with ten questions. Send them a short email with one specific question that they can answer in one sentence.

 

[2:16:15] And if after all of that, they're still not responding, then you need to have a very direct conversation with them and say, "Listen, I need to know if you're still committed to this relationship because I can't do my job effectively if I can't communicate with you."

 

[2:16:45] And if they're still not responsive after that, then you might need to consider exiting the relationship because a relationship without communication is not going to work. It's not going to be successful for either party.

 

[2:17:15] Absolutely. And I think that's a great segue into something that we didn't explicitly cover but is really important, which is knowing when to walk away. And I think tonight we gave you guys a lot of examples of situations where we had to walk away.

 

[2:17:45] And I want you guys to understand that walking away is not a failure. Walking away is actually a success because you're protecting your time, you're protecting your energy, you're protecting your reputation, and you're making space for better opportunities to come into your life.

 

[2:18:15] So don't ever feel like you failed because you had to exit a relationship. Sometimes exiting a relationship is the smartest business decision you can make. And we've done it multiple times, and every time we've done it, better opportunities have come our way.

 

[2:18:45] Exactly. And I see Shang is asking, what's the minimum time you should give an account before deciding if it's going to work or not?

 

[2:19:15] Great question, Shang. So it really depends on the type of account and the type of offer. But generally speaking, I would say you want to give it at least 90 days, three months, before you make a final decision.

 

[2:19:45] Because in those first 90 days, you're going to go through all of the phases that we talked about tonight. You're going to go through the pre-close, the pre-launch, the launch, and you're going to start building that relationship. And by the end of 90 days, you should have a pretty clear picture of whether this is going to work or not.

 

[2:20:15] Now, if there are major red flags that come up in the first 30 days, like ethical issues, like we talked about with the MLM situation, then obviously you don't need to wait 90 days. You can exit immediately. But if it's just performance issues, if it's just the offer not being proven yet, then give it 90 days.

 

[2:20:45] And during those 90 days, make sure you're documenting everything, make sure you're communicating regularly, make sure you're bringing solutions to the table. And then at the end of 90 days, you can sit down and have an honest conversation about whether this relationship should continue or not.

 

[2:21:15] Perfect. And I think one more thing to add to that is also setting those expectations from the very beginning. So when you're in that pre-close phase, when you're having those initial conversations, you want to make sure that you're setting the expectation that this is a 90-day trial period.

 

[2:21:45] And at the end of those 90 days, we're going to sit down and we're going to review the performance, we're going to review the relationship, and we're going to decide together if this is something that we want to continue. And by setting that expectation from the beginning, it makes that 90-day conversation a lot easier.

 

[2:22:15] Absolutely. All right, I see we're getting close to time here. Any other final questions before we wrap up? Let's see. Okay, I see a lot of thank yous, a lot of appreciation. You guys are very welcome.

 

[2:22:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Key Takeaways Recap"

 

NÚMEROS: 5 fases, 9 problemas, 90 dias trial

 

VISUAL: Recap visual dos principais pontos da aula

 

[2:23:00] All right, so let me just do a very quick recap of the key takeaways from tonight. Number one, share of wallet is a critical concept for managing high ticket accounts. You want to be thinking about how much of your client's budget you're capturing versus their competitors.

 

[2:23:30] Number two, there are five phases to account management: pre-close, pre-launch, launch, build relationship, and solution. And each phase is critical. You can't skip any of them. You have to go through all of them methodically.

 

[2:24:00] Number three, there are nine most harmful problems that we've identified through our experience managing dozens of accounts across multiple industries. And those nine problems are: poor marketing, unproven offer, lack of clarity, poor closer performance, tax and payment issues, lack of reporting, unethical business practices, lack of market knowledge, and lack of documentation.

 

[2:24:30] Number four, difficult conversations are inevitable. But if you handle them correctly, if you come with data, if you come with solutions, if you take extreme ownership, then those difficult conversations can actually strengthen the relationship rather than weaken it.

 

[2:25:00] And number five, the relationship never stops at the sale. If you're delivering an ultra high ticket service or product, then account management is just as important, if not more important, than the initial close. Because that's where the real money is made through upsells, cross-sells, and long-term retention.

 

[2:25:30] All right, so with that, I want to thank everybody for being here tonight. I know it was a long class, but we covered a lot of ground. And I hope you guys got tremendous value from it. Stephanie, Raphael, any final words before we close out?

 

[2:26:00] Yes, I just want to say thank you to everyone for being here and for being so engaged. I saw a lot of great participation in the chat, a lot of great questions. And I'm really excited to see you guys apply these principles to your own accounts and to see the results that you're going to get.

 

[2:26:30] And remember, if you have any questions as you're implementing these strategies, don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to support you. We're here to help you succeed. And we want to see you crushing it with your accounts.

 

[2:27:00] Absolutely. And from my side, I just want to echo what Stephanie said. This community is incredible. The level of commitment, the level of dedication that I see from you guys is really inspiring. And I have no doubt that if you apply what we taught you tonight, you're going to see massive results.

 

[2:27:30] And just remember, every battle is won before it is fought. So do your due diligence, do your preparation, build those foundations properly, and you're going to set yourself up for success. And with that, you guys are closer than you think.

 

[2:28:00] All right, awesome. Thank you everybody for being here. Thank you, Stephanie. Thank you, Raphael. Thank you, Buckley, for chiming in. Thank you, Aaron, for sharing your experience. And we'll see you guys on the next class. Have a great night, everybody.

 

[2:28:30] Good night, everyone. Thank you. Take care. Bye-bye.
