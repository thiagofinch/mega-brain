[01:15] Okay, I will give everyone some time to type in the chat. And while I do so, I think we have Richard Jay with us tonight. So, Rich J, are you here with us?

 

[01:25] I'm here. Inner Circle family, get ready for it.

 

[01:30] Did they actually say it in chat? Let's see. Let's see if they got it. Let's see. The two motivators.

 

[01:40] I think some of us are going back into our notes. What were they again?

 

[01:45] Adam's got it. Yeah. Controlling of the data. Once you control the data, you do control your world. What was the other one?

 

[01:55] No one owes me a thing. William says.

 

[02:00] Adam is fast. That's right. Nobody owes you anything and they don't know you, right? We'll go through that kind of a quick review too in the slides here.

[02:20] But why don't we get started. So today is module two. Last time it was module two, but part one. Today we have part two for you guys.

 

[02:30] Put in the chat if you guys are excited to learn a new set of frameworks based off of our ultra high ticket prospecting tree. The money tree.

 

[02:40] Yes. Seeing a lot of yeses in the chat. Ultra. Yes. Ultra. Yes, that's correct. That is going to be the key word today.

 

[02:55] We'll see if we can count how many times we use the word ultra today. All right. So, tonight we had, by the way, how good was Sean Lawrence last week or two weeks ago in class? Put in the chat.

 

[03:10] Amazing. Great. Awesome. So helpful, Adam says. Amazing. Right.

 

[03:20] Today we do not have Shawn, but we will be accompanied by none other than the wonderful Donna here. And I actually am very excited about today's class because it touches upon something that we spent a lot of time doing on the B2B team, the business development team here at Danlock Education.

 

[03:45] So I'm really excited to take a lot of that what we spent hours, countless of hours doing and actually sharing with you guys exactly how we did it. And when I say it, do you guys have any idea maybe what we'd be covering today on today's class?

 

[04:05] Let's see. We didn't really give the hint out on Facebook, but let's see if anybody remembers. It is prospecting. Prospecting for sure. It's going to be a different type.

 

[04:20] They don't know it. I don't think it is actually prospecting but in a way that very few of us actually do. It's called video prospecting.

 

[04:30] How many of you guys have actually done video prospecting very actively with your accounts?

 

[04:35] I see Adam did. GGO did back then. Adam says back then it seems like a while back. It was only yesterday. Adam also a few people not yet.

[04:55] So this will be really really cool because I think you'll find that the reason why video prospecting at least the way we do it complements the whole idea of ultra is because we are accelerating the results that you get using it.

 

[05:15] So, we'll step into that. And just so you know, a lot of what we did as prospectors on the B2B team, the bisdev team was really from closing packages forclosers.com as well as copywriters.com as the internal sales team for team Danlock.

 

[05:35] So, really excited about sharing that with you guys. And got some reminders for everybody.

[05:45] Yes. So, make sure you turn off all distractions. If you do use your phone for Discord, make sure you use it for Discord. Comment often within the chat. If you have any questions, make sure you drop them in Discord as well.

 

[06:00] And don't be shy. Like I said, if you have any questions, just drop them in there. We are support the family. So, we are here to support each other and maybe someone else has the same question as you.

 

[06:15] So, don't be afraid to ask your questions. Be resourceful and show up each week because that is when you will get the most out of everything and go back to the replays and revisit the material of course.

 

[06:30] Awesome. All right, guys. Let's head into it. This is part two again of ultra high ticket prospecting.

 

[06:40] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Review: The Roots"

 

NÚMEROS: 2 motivadores principais

 

VISUAL: Diagrama de raízes da árvore, elementos visuais de fundação

 

[06:45] Just a quick review. We asked about the roots from last week. Does anybody remember maybe one or two of the mindsets? Actually, we covered two last week.

 

[07:00] Put in the chat if you remember the two mindsets we covered that lie on top of the roots giving you that unshakable unshakable confidence and that unshakable base for functioning as a ultra high ticket closer.

 

[07:20] Let's see. Alyssa says, "Curiosity, stay curious, stay genuine, data control, control the world, the connection." Yep. They don't owe us anything. Yep.

 

[07:35] Those are the roots. And so when we talked about mindset, one of them was curiosity. Okay. Right. The search for wisdom. We talked about curiosity, staying curious. And then there was one more.

 

[07:55] Trying to read on the chat here. Adam says, "Constant improvement and systematic approach." That's right. That's right. You got it, Adam. Diego as well. Nice.

 

[08:10] It is the systematic improvement because as salespeople at the core, we still have the responsibility. We still have the right really to go back and take a look and see how we can get better every day.

 

[08:30] That's part of the reason why you guys are here, right? Is how can we close bigger deals? How can we set ourselves up for success when we're closing deals that are in the order of magnitude larger than what we see in the BTOC realm? Right?

[08:55] So, tale of two trees. We talked about this before. Just wanted to just quickly touch on this. This is the framework for the money tree that we talk about here in ultra high ticket prospecting.

 

[09:10] We really want to build up that tree of life, that tree of money for you. And last week we covered the motivators which are the roots, the mindsets and then we also talked about strategies too, right?

 

[09:30] And somebody mentioned when you guys logged on some of the scheduling, the intention of time usage, time blocking, the time suck. You guys remember the time suck?

 

[09:45] And then finally, we actually Sean was very very gracious enough to share with us some of his teams and also his personal email strategies and messaging as well.

VISUAL: Estrutura hierárquica mostrando: Roots → Mindset → Strategy → Tactics

 

[10:05] All right, so that was last week. How does that tie into this week? Well, this week is part two. We're going to use the same framework.

 

[10:15] We're going to start off with two really core motivators, go into the mindset, and then talk about strategic company research, and then I think you're really going to like this.

 

[10:30] Towards the end of the class, we're actually going to show you how we actually crack the nut in terms of getting people to respond, getting prospects to respond to us by using video. You guys excited about that?

 

[10:45] I don't know. Ra, do you want to share that with them? Only if they're excited. I mean, let's see. I can see the chat blow up a little bit, but yeah. Okay. Yeah, I think they are excited. Yes.

 

[11:05] All right. So, let's start. And actually, I do want to spend today's going to be a little bit more interactive because I want you guys to come online.

 

[11:15] I think Dana's going to help unmute a little bit and then I'll kind of open it up for more questions this time than last time. We're going to go through the motivators and the mindset a little bit quicker, right?

 

[11:30] We'll have some exercises there so we can practice and understand some of these critical things. But at the same time, I want to spend a lot of time on the strategies and also the tactics of video prospecting as well. Does that sound good, guys?

[11:55] All right. So, let's start with motivators. Before we do that, let's do a quick round of word associations. What do you say, Dana?

 

[12:05] Yes, definitely. So actually let us know in the chat what feelings or what emotions come up when you hear about this.

 

[12:15] And this is interesting. So think about think about it this way. Think about the fact that it takes you five or six months just to close a deal. Not five or six weeks, five or six months.

 

[12:30] How do you guys feel about that type of deal cycle? As we say, a lot of people say long, slow, very long, dragging, impatient, marathon.

 

[12:50] Mhm. Must be a big deal. Some say normal process depends on deal size. Massive followup. Lots of decision makers. Long breath, relationship, and trust.

 

[13:10] Perfect. These are all these are all core. So, it does actually the I don't know who is who said that sometimes these are the bigger deals take longer. Sometimes not even the big deals take longer.

 

[13:30] I mean, Adam, you could probably comment, right? Sometimes we're farming kind of high to medium ticket, medium high ticket deals for quite a long time before we actually close.

 

[13:45] So a lot of times when we think of if we haven't done this actively as a group here sometimes we think about hey you know what five months is a long ass time it's a long time to be fed right.

 

[14:00] Adam says half a year. Half a year right six nine months sometimes okay we're going to talk a little bit about that in a second.

 

[14:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Video Resume Exercise"

 

NÚMEROS: Não especificados

[14:20] Here's another one gonna jump actually this is kind of a jump tell us how you feel about recording and see if we talked about this in HTC Recording your own video resume.

 

[14:35] Put in the chat if you have actually recorded a video resume to date and sent it to somebody.

 

[14:45] Adam does it multiple times, multiple ones. Yeah, a lot of people have done it. Some not yet. Some are saying not yet.

 

[15:00] Yeah. Okay. What's for those of you who have done it? Great. We're going to talk about that actually and the feelings behind that and some of the ways we can even make some breakthroughs.

 

[15:20] But for the ones who have not actually tried it yet and tried to differentiate using video for themselves, what are some of the reasons why?

 

[15:35] Stress. Stressful. Yep. Not sure what goes into it. Lack of clarity. Script and direction.

 

[15:50] Actually, since we have Adam, Adam is clearly one of our leaders here in the community, setting lots of great examples. Can we unmute Adam? Adam, if you're there, just for a second.

 

[16:10] And if you'll put your hand up here, we'll unmute you for a second. Tell us a little bit about your experience with the video resume process.

 

[16:25] Hi Rich. Hi Dana. Can you hear me? Hey, we can hear you. Yes. Awesome.

 

[16:35] So yeah, I really had a great experience with team. It was pretty pretty awesome to use videos because I was specifically targeting Europe and videos were not very prominent there.

 

[16:55] So therefore the companies were really surprised and very open to it. Now when I take a look I'm subscribed to multiple newsletters to keep track of the influencers and I noticed that now video resumes are a must.

 

[17:15] So therefore you should really get comfortable with your resumes. And if you want to I can also share my framework of what I did to make the video more successful.

 

[17:30] This is great. Adam, can you tell us a little bit about the first time you actually went about and did something on video to broadcast your professional background? How did you feel about it? Were you excited, anxious, stressed like some people have said here in the chat?

 

[17:55] Well, I did not feel stress or anxiety that much because I'm what you say in Germany like which means I really love the spotlight. But I have to say despite me being that and despite me really being comfortable with videos which was elevated tremendously since the video assignments that we had in HTC.

 

[18:20] I felt that I needed a lot of practice actually. So for example I made the first video and I was stuttering. I was like what the hell is happening? I'm comfortable with this, but I'm stuttering. And I did it again and again and again.

 

[18:40] And then I noticed, okay, like I couldn't even go one minute without making a spelling or a speaking mistake or messing something up.

 

[18:55] Mhm. And that comes because and this is why I said I didn't feel nervous, but I was I was nervous, but I didn't notice it. So when you notice that you're nervous, this is awesome because you already know that you are and you can deal with it.

 

[19:15] If you don't know you're nervous, well, that's another issue because you then just don't see it. Right. Right.

 

[19:25] So, by the end, thank you, Adam, for sharing that because I think what we want to do here for the rest of the community who have not actually explored this avenue is we want to welcome them into the idea that this can become a core part of their strategy and this can actually be very very fruitful.

 

[19:50] Now, Adam, before you go, can you tell us a little bit about your success rate or any kind of comments about some of the wins that you've had with the video resumes?

 

[20:10] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Adam's Video Success Framework"

 

NÚMEROS: 3 componentes principais (three-pronged approach)

 

VISUAL: Diagrama de três pilares: Research → Personalization → Value

 

[20:15] Yes. Actually, the success rate and response rate was incredibly high because people just responded to it. But the reason for that was several points.

 

[20:30] And if there's something that you want to teach about, just tell me and I'll stop. I don't want to like spoil anything.

 

[20:40] That's okay. Give us give us one kernel of wisdom, please.

 

[20:45] So basically what made it very successful was a three-pronged approach. The first thing I did was doing intense research. Every single social medium the person had that I was reaching out to.

 

[21:05] Every single post I read them. I read every email. I read the funnel. I was working through it like a workhorse. I was going through everything.

 

[21:20] And once that was done, I made a screen a combination between a screen share and a video of me recording so people could see me and I was illustrating based on their social media and them personally.

 

[21:40] I made it extremely personal to them using their name multiple times. So they saw that it is not a pre-recorded thing and this really did it for them.

 

[21:55] And from there people saw I put in effort. I gave them tremendous value and it worked very well.

 

[22:10] Later on, I noticed some people don't respond anyways and some people require the video to be sent in certain forms. So, what I did was using a so-called fake audit where it looked like I made a video and I asked them, "Well, I made a video for you. Whom do I send it to?"

 

[22:35] And they were like, "Oh, yeah, the video doesn't work. Can you send it there?" And then I knew this person wants one. Then I made it and I sent it. And that saved me a lot of time and had the same effect.

 

[22:55] This is great. This is great. Actually if you wouldn't mind chiming in when we get to the video section because I know you're definitely one of the more active ones.

 

[23:10] We had a team definitely of very many active but I'll tell you what here's the reality right the reality is we actually on the bisdev team we all started from pretty much the same place like we had never most of us had never done a video resume or even a video pitch before.

 

[23:35] But by the end of like I would say two weeks we became extremely comfortable doing it right so that that's what that's what we want to get to today kind of give you guys a glimpse of what it would take to get to that level of comfort effort.

 

[23:55] We won't be able to, of course, do the actual the full-on practice session of that here on the class today, but I tell you what, if you guys can keep a promise, we may even try to release some of the actual successful videos that have created conversions for this team.

 

[24:20] Okay. So can you guys keep a promise and say let's say do not share this keep it completely within the HTCIC community.

 

[24:35] I see a lot of yeses in the chat. So I think I think they will.

 

[24:40] This is absolutely guys a proprietary part of how we do business here. So, and I think it's just such a great thing that Sefue is willing to have us share some of the stuff directly from personal experience being on the team.

 

[25:00] So, if we share some of that content with you after the class or even on Kajjabi, just please be sure to not to share it. Keep it to yourself, but make it something that actually improves your effectiveness. Is that a deal, guys?

 

[25:20] One other thing, by the way, is this is a different kind of a different spin on it is I'm curious to know how many of you guys out there have actually started closing on video, which is to say usually maybe it's a Zoom call or you're walking people through a demo.

 

[25:40] Put in the chat if you actually done some of that. I see some have. True Zoom. I have done a demo but not for closing. Okay. Not yet.

 

[26:00] All right. We may call on you guys a little bit later in the presentation just to get some of your feedback and input and your experiences.

 

[26:15] But for those of you who actually have not done the closing via video, how do you guys feel about doing a presentation maybe like 30 40 minutes with question and answer in order to close a client? How do you feel about that concept, that idea at this moment?

 

[26:40] I see. Awesome. Love it. It's great. Showtime.

 

[26:50] Some of us are actually very I'll tell you what, just kind of as an aside, I was I was extremely comfortable doing it. Not that I was good at pres, but I knew that at least on Zoom, there are some things you can control, right?

 

[27:10] There's we can actually talk about this in more detail if we hit upon these topics but with a zoom video you can actually control the pace you can actually control whether or not your video is on right.

 

[27:30] Some some of us tend to keep it off so that the distractions or the focus actually is maintained on the presentation so this is also in line with breaking out of that mold.

NÚMEROS: 10 fishing rods → thousands of fish

 

VISUAL: Comparação visual: barco pequeno com varas vs barco grande com redes

 

[27:55] So so I would say the majority of us here have not done much of this before. So the idea is to get out of that mold or that the habit of or the comfort zone I should say of not having done this.

 

[28:15] So so today's roots let's move into the roots for today. The first one is ultra big thinking because we all have by the way after last session right we all now have ultra big goals right.

 

[28:35] So if we have ultra big goals what does that mean about our thinking we got to think big we got to think bigger at least right.

 

[28:50] So here's an analogy so after last class. Maybe we got a little bit of thinking think about the calendar, right? How you guys are starting to organize and time block and really put in additional fishing rods out there to make sure that you are getting as many prospects in the door into your pipeline into your boat as possible. Right?

 

[29:20] So, where maybe in HTC you were thinking of just using two or three fishing rods, now you're thinking, okay, how can I make sure my entire schedule's booked, how can I make sure I've got 10 fishing rods all around the boat in different directions, right? You guys agree with that?

 

[29:45] Well, what if I told you and you looked at you looked at your boat and you're thinking to you're thinking to yourself, "Hey, you know what? What if I had what if I had to double, triple, quadruple the fishing rods on this boat? Could you guys do it?

 

[30:10] What are they saying in the chat? Seeing a lot of yeses. Seems like they all can do it. They all think they can do it. That's great.

 

[30:25] But there comes a time that maybe around the edge of the boat, you run out of space, don't we? Right? We all we all have the same boat. We've got a ton of unlimited fishing, but by the time you line up all the fishing rods, you start running out of space. You guys agree?

 

[30:50] Like you look at your calendar, like how many of you guys have more of a packed calendar today than you did two weeks ago or three weeks ago or four weeks ago? Your calendar only has 24 hours in a day, right?

 

[31:10] So, we have to start thinking, what can we do to think ultra big instead of just big? Maybe it's changing the game a little bit.

 

[31:25] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Fishing Rods vs Nets"

 

NÚMEROS: Thousands of fish vs individual catches

 

VISUAL: Pescador com varas pescando alguns peixes vs barco comercial com rede pegando milhares

 

[31:30] What if we instead of fishing just with the rods, what if we just did a hybrid? We threw some nets out there. You can see this guy. He's just he's just reeling in. I don't know. He's probably got thousands of fish coming on board now, right?

 

[31:55] He's also has the size of the boat changed from the last picture. He's also got a bigger boat, right? Bigger boat, bigger net.

 

[32:10] So, what if I told you for those of you here listening, if you look at your calendar and your calendar's completely packed right now, I'm talking to only those who have a packed calendar, okay?

 

[32:30] You guys have a packed calendar throughout the entire week and the weekends. What if I told you that was just a fishing rod analogy and that you have actually not even started using the nets yet?

 

[32:50] Let me read in the chat here real quick. Bobby says, "Wow." Aiden says, "Bro."

 

[33:00] All right. I'm I'm trying to paint a picture for you and you guys tell me please by the end of this module here part two if we really talked about switching the rods to the net analogy.

 

[33:20] Okay, I want you guys to be honest at the end of the class. You tell me if you think that we went from talking about 10 fishing rods to 10 nets in a bigger boat. Keith says, "Give me the net."

NÚMEROS: 24 horas por dia

 

VISUAL: Calendário completamente preenchido, blocos de tempo coloridos

 

[33:45] All right. All right. Hold your horses. That's what we had. Like I showed this slide last time we were together and it was packed. This is probably your calendar, right? Or what we're working to.

 

[34:05] But we got to change something about this. Maybe we're adding four calendars, five calendars on top of this in a certain way, right? Maybe we're changing the type of appointments, right?

 

[34:25] So, as a thought exercise, real quick, what are some ways? Like, if I said, "Hey, hey guys. Hey, Adam. Adam, how can we actually 10x your effectiveness from where you were with those fishing rod? How can we actually change everything to nets? What would it be? What would it look like?

 

[34:50] Let's say become independent from time to effort. For example, if I put in one hour of prospecting and I only measure it by calls that I make that doesn't work as much.

 

[35:10] So I need to use technology in a way maybe like videos is a form of technology but also how which tools can I use which strategies can I use to multiply it. Yeah, for example, what happens if I post a video in a group?

 

[35:30] Suddenly thousands of people see it or hundreds depending on the group size and then people react to it. That's a completely different thing.

 

[35:45] So if I might summarize, I guess you're referring to maybe actions that are more one to many. Yes. Actions that actually multip.

 

[36:00] So you're doing one single action, but it yields multiples. So instead of you're sending one email to one person, you're sending you're posting one thing that hits 500 people. Yes.

[36:25] Okay. Good. Let's talk a little bit about that in a second. And actually, we'll turn it into actual exercise because I want you guys to think out of the box first before I show you one of the ways we do this or one of the ways the industry bests do this. Is that okay with you guys?

 

[36:50] I want to talk about this guy here. How many of you guys remember this guy from HTC? It's a pretty animal, the lone wolf. Okay.

 

[37:05] How many of you guys feel like even as we talked about it last week, the whole idea of ultra high ticket prospecting, the structured the intentional frequency at which we structure our time, all of those things that we talked about last week, even the templates, the way we use them, those strategies, right?

 

[37:30] Those are still kind of things we do ourselves, right? Things we do, things that we are doing to focus and hone in on our personal effectiveness. Right? Agreed.

 

[37:50] So, back to HTC, what happens to the lone wolf? A lot of people say they die, starve. He dies as the winter comes.

 

[38:10] Yeah. So you guys can imagine what I'm getting to here in a second, right? This we're talking about creating the net. Okay. So the lone wolf dies and who survives? That's the pack. That's the pack.

[38:35] So these are analogies like we we love at team Dan Lock. We use so many different analogies, but the idea is like who is the pack here and why is the pack related to the net?

 

[38:55] Can anybody think or give me some ideas here so we can start talking from the from the audience here? What what are some ideas? What is it we could do that where we're leveraging other people to create like Adam just said multiples?

 

[39:20] Everyone says steam delegation leadership work together. Like got God says cover more territory I like that. Leverage. Kelly says leverage split efforts.

 

[39:40] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We talked about that, remember Adam? At some point. Okay. Work with the pack support. This is good. Yeah.

 

[39:55] So, I want you guys to think about because we often like in HTC we talked about, you know, making sure that we're working together as a community, right? And helping each other succeed because that's at the end of the day, you're going to have a much much higher chance of survival when you do that.

 

[40:20] It is the same way as you develop a ultra high ticket closer mindset because you're starting to think in multiples. You're starting to think like you guys said in leverage instead of just one one one. We have to scale this activity. So how do we scale it? Okay.

[40:50] So that is the that is the root. This is the motivation because you have ultra high ticket goals now. You have super high goals. So the only way you can address those goals knowing that you have to close bigger deals on orders of magnitudes higher is that you actually have to think bigger, much bigger. Think ultra.

 

[41:15] That should be our mantra by the way. Think ultra is Apple was what? Think different, right? Think ultra.

 

[41:30] So here's the exercise. I want you guys to take a minute and you've got a piece of paper in front of you, right? Because you guys are taking notes, I assume.

 

[41:45] So on that piece of paper, write down as many different things you can think of. Some of them came up in the chat already. Most of them I heard around kind of team-based stuff, but I want you guys to list as many things you can think of that will actually multiply orders of magnitude in terms of better results, bigger deals, more bigger deals, more higher quality, bigger deals.

 

[42:15] Okay, let's take a few seconds to do that. Let me see if there are any questions here on the Discord. We're going to compare answers, by the way. That's why I want you to take just a few seconds to do that.

 

[42:35] And this is in all in all, this is just a creativity exercise. I want you guys to think about these things and then instead of me just kind of spouting the answers out, I want maybe you guys will come up with something that is also extremely relevant, too.

 

[42:55] So, let's let's list some of these things out. Okay, is this good? Okay, so you guys have listed at least two or three down down there on paper.

 

[43:10] So, start typing in the chat the one that's most creative that you think nobody else here in the chat is going to name. Okay, I want to see the we already talked about team leverage. What else do we have?

 

[43:30] I see good strong funnel brands routines make a team of combined for right strengths. Mhm. I like that b capacity. Focus on what you're brilliant brilliant at and delegate the rest. Bigger affirmations.

 

[43:55] Okay. Yeah. Some of that the mindset work is definitely necessary. We talked about that too last week.

 

[44:10] Adam says, "Organization in a squad. One person looks for possible fits, one researches it, one creates the video, and one closes."

 

[44:25] I like the specialization. We're going to talk about that. Actually, we'll just mention I mean, we're going to spend a lot of time on the video and the reason why it's so powerful.

 

[44:45] But certainly specialization is a common theme here. Got leadership. Okay. All right. Derek says, "Close clients to their prospects after he becomes client."

 

[45:05] Getting there. We're getting there. Getting warmer. Can you guys be some of you guys have given like kind of one word. Can you guys be why don't we do this?

 

[45:20] Let's do a quick unmute. Hands up if you guys have maybe of a creative one you guys want to share that you haven't seen in the chat yet or maybe you want to expand on something that you just said.

 

[45:40] Let's try to think of something outside of specialization because we know specialization is great. We tal we even talked about that remember last the last module we talked about blocking things off and making sure that we do things in batches.

 

[46:00] Same thing goes for for here and video prospecting right but outside of specialization and outside of kind of the teamwork that we're talking about you some of you put your hands up and I want to hear kind of some of the the other creative ideas that you have.

 

[46:25] I saw Bogdan was one of the first. Okay, so let's see. That's great. Let's let's grab Bogdan. Yes, you can hear yourself. Okay.

 

[46:45] Hey, Bogdan. Hello, Rich. Hello, Dana. So, the number one thing that I thought of a few years ago as I was fresh out of college, civil engineering college in order to help my dad with his business as he was struggling was to just go out there and build connections with people like accountants, bankers, consultants, industry experts without wanting something from them.

 

[47:20] Just getting them to know the name, knowing the fact that we exist, knowing the fact that we are actively pursuing and working. And I call this the or my dad called it the backend dream team.

[47:45] Because we could always go back to these people when we would find a deal and leverage these relationships. We didn't have to start looking for them. We didn't need referrals. We didn't need to waste time like headless chickens because we didn't know who to go to.

 

[48:10] And they were so powerful these relationships that when we were bringing stuff to the table, a deal people outside of our connections were throwing themselves into them. Hey, I want a part of I want a part of.

 

[48:30] And from 2013 2012, 13, 14 my dad struggling not having anybody to help him to 2015 and 16 ignoring or saying no to 90% of the people because they were like, "Yeah, you guys are the ones that are always following up on your promises. You have good connections. You always take care of your this backend dream team. We want a part of it, want a part of it."

 

[49:00] And we ended up saying more more nos than than yeses. And I think that is the one aspect that a lot of people ignore. They don't want to do it because they say I don't have any instant gain out of it and I don't have a fundamental promise that sometime in the future I will get something.

 

[49:25] But as long as you are committed, this this backend dream team will come about at a time when you need it most and will amplify any business idea or help help you close or help you take it to different levels.

 

[49:50] That's amazing. And and you said backend as in the back end of something backend dream.

 

[50:00] No, no, just this is something that my my dad came up with. It's like it's like one of those dream teams that you don't actively pay later on like they're not they're not on your payroll or anything like that, right? You don't pay them for anything. They're just strong connections out there in the marketplace. They're doing their own thing.

 

[50:25] But once you you have a deal or something very similar to what Dan Pena is doing and let's say you want you want to have a merger and acquisition right now during these times, right? You want to purchase something and you want to do owner finance everything.

 

[50:45] You don't need to go out there, waste six, nine, 12 months building this team and trying to convince them. They're already there. You just need to cherrypick them. They're already in your network.

 

[51:05] Yeah. Like I will go to Adam. I'll go to Dana. I'll come to you. I'll go to Jake. I'll go to Rang God and so on. They are you are already there. We know each other. We have the relationships. We trust each other.

 

[51:25] We do our own thing. We have our own businesses. But we come together in this time and we just we crush it. Like the market just takes such a huge positive impact from from stuff like this. People need to put in the work initially.

 

[51:45] This is this is critical. So everybody here that's listening to this story, I think it it is a extremely good example of where you you don't you don't wait till you're hungry when you stick the fishing rod out of the boat, right? Or when you throw that net.

 

[52:10] You don't wait until you're starving before you do any of this. You're actually constantly setting that I go back to the concept of pipeline or even just setting up your network is so by the time you actually need to fish, the fish are already jumping into your your boat, right?

 

[52:35] So this is a great great example and I think it's a it's a great example of from a timing and cadence timing perspective you guys are leveraging what is called frontloading or preloading your pipeline.

 

[52:55] I wouldn't say pipeline because these are not actually prospects per se. They're probably people that you guys can do deals with if if I'm understanding that correctly. Right, Bogdan?

 

[53:10] Yeah, but you said it right. You said it right because each of these individual people, they have their own individual pipeline and their own dream 100 or 10,000 customers. Yep. And they will bring some of them to the table.

 

[53:30] Yes. Yes. And that's what makes it so unique and so special because all of a sudden it gets amplified and you're like, "Holy what happened?" Yeah. Yeah.

 

[53:50] So, do you mind if we expand on that tonight? Actually, I think I think Bognan has a great point. We're going to expand on just that concept and he mentioned a key word tonight which is dream 100. We're actually going to go into that as part of the strategy piece. Is that okay with you guys? Bogdan, are you okay if we we kind of expand on that that topic?

 

[54:15] Sounds great. Of course. Awesome. Thank you.

[54:30] I want one more example, guys. If you if you want to raise your hands, keep your hands raised for another creative example of how to think in orders of magnitude. You got to think ultra. Let's see.

 

[54:50] So, make sure you use a hand icon within Zoom. Think ultra. That's right. That's the new motto, the new slogan. What do you think, Dana? I don't see any hands up. So, okay, I'll go ahead and let's move forward here so we can make some progress.

 

[55:15] But here are a couple things that I just listed for you guys. The common things around personally developing capabilities, right? Obviously, if you you're you demand nine hours of sleep a day, then you're you're you're actually it's sleeping less, maybe it's creating a more efficient call system for yourself, your conversion ratios are getting better.

 

[55:40] These are the very very standard things that we think about, right? What we're going to focus on today has to do with the last four points in greater detail.

 

[55:55] Here's still kind of general, but here, how do we improve your personal marketing ability? How do you spend maybe this will be a question for you guys if it makes sense to spend more time qualifying your prospects before bringing them into a deeper discussion right or doing that what what Adam was saying earlier which is that hard research more research right.

 

[56:25] How can we differentiate when communicating again we're talking about most of the time we're talking about prospecting unless you're like bogden is thinking out of the box and setting setting up those conversations naturally over time.

 

[56:45] But here we'll bring the conversation back into the realm of prospecting, which means that hey, maybe some of these people you're not talking to all the time, but you do need to reach out to them, right? And find that relationship, find that common common ground.

 

[57:05] And then of course, you guys are pretty quick on it, which is specialization, utilizing teams to produce some kind of net result, right? Am I missing anything? We can always we can always add to this list too.

[57:30] All right. So here is I want you guys to write this down. This is so the first route is what? Let's see. Think ultra big. Think ultra.

 

[57:50] Well, just to shorten it, we'll just say think ultra. That just means because you you guys I mean obviously we're going to we're going to hit some of these bigger goals, right? So, you have to think big. Think ultra.

 

[58:10] Second second tree tree root at the very very core of what motivates us to do this is because we know and I'm going to for now until we get into some of the numbers I'm going to propose that let's try to see if it makes sense to qualify harder because the hypothesis is if you qualify harder it means more money comes.

 

[58:40] I don't know if that's true actually. Isn't it also rich that it takes takes more time as well. And isn't it so that more time means less deals closed?

 

[58:55] Actually you you you're stumbling on a good point, Dana. It's like like if I'm going to spend more time researching and qualifying, doesn't mean I have less hours in a day to to close these deals, right?

 

[59:15] How many of you guys actually thought about that? Like, gosh, do I want to spend half a day on Saturdays like researching the crap out of my list?

 

[59:30] Christian says, "It occurred to me." William says, "Kind of. It takes time, right? It takes time off your schedule." Ivan says he does a lot of research before he contacts while doing outreach and then he was he was unsure.

[59:55] Okay, so let's let's talk a little bit about that. I'm just going to leave it out here as a hypothesis. First, let me ask you guys this. I've got a set of questions here.

 

[1:00:10] I just want to make sure if you guys aren't already qualifying, these might be some of the questions you're asking, right? Does this person match the ideal customer profile? Is this person located in a key geographic area? Right? What's the size? What's the size in terms of revenues?

 

[1:00:35] What's the size in terms of number of employees, customers? Right? What's the size of the actual department? It may not be the entire company we're selling to, right? It just might be a part the the single department. It could be an ID IT department. It could be a set of doctors in a clinic in a hospital network, right? What's the size of the department?

 

[1:01:00] Are they actually in an industry that's a good fit? Right? Are they currently using any kind of competitor's products? Obviously, you should be looking at these. How long have they been in business? What would actually cause us to disqualify them immediately? What are those red flags?

 

[1:01:25] Right now, I want you guys to be honest. Many of you are already closing or are on sales teams. So, I want you to be completely honest. How much time do you guys spend researching a prospect? Researching somebody on your lead who looks like they might want to buy.

 

[1:01:50] How much time do you spend per prospect before you actually send that email? Before you actually pick up the phone, John says 20 minutes. Good. Greg says, "A lot minutes."

 

[1:02:10] How many of you guys actually spend an hour on a prospect researching Greg says at least. I like that. Greg. Greg's my kind of guy. Sean says 5 minutes for cold, 10 to 20 minutes for warm. That's pretty cool. Okay.

 

[1:02:30] How many of you guys are are not afraid to admit that some days you just go and take your list and you just don't do any of this? You just start typing that email. You start picking up the phone and just winging it.

 

[1:02:50] Stan Lee, I'll be I'll be the first to admit I've done that. I've done that many many times. And I will tell you if you guys haven't had the experience yet, by by the end of the week, you kind of wonder, right?

NÚMEROS:

UHTC: 2,500 leads → 197 qualified → 90 days → 60 clients closed (30% close rate) = 2% return

Brute Force: 2,500 leads → 2,500 contacted → 365 days → 75 clients closed (3% close rate) = 3% return

 

VISUAL: Tabela comparativa com duas linhas, colunas mostrando processo de qualificação, tempo investido, taxa de fechamento

 

[1:03:15] Okay. So question is let's propose something. Okay. Should we qualify harder? So I'm going to give you two cases here of something similar that I've observed from working with a business client.

 

[1:03:35] And I'm just going to say that we had some people on the team that actually just did the minimal work and some people actually spent a lot of time researching. Okay. So, here's a kind of walkthrough of the numbers of what it would look like.

 

[1:03:55] So, put your emerald hats on. Just bear with me for so for those of you just not into looking at the numbers, but this is so important. Okay, guys.

 

[1:04:10] All right. So, in the first row, this is the UHTC style, and I'm going to call it UHTC style because it's hard qualification. Okay. In the second row, we're just going to call that brute force. Just going to pick up the phone, send out the email, smile and dial, you know, just do it.

 

[1:04:35] So, what's the difference? Well, when we qualify, let's say we we have about 2500 leads and we're spending some of you guys said 20 minutes, right? 15 to 20 minutes. Spending 15 to 20 minutes really qualifying.

 

[1:04:55] And out of those 2500 leads, you actually get them down to maybe less than 200, right? That's about 8% of your your original list. You guys following me here so far? All right.

 

[1:05:15] So, now you've got a list that maybe you can get them to book and start closing, right? Or start having a conversation at least. Some of the B2B deals are just not going to be closed in one call. As we all know, so the question is is like these 197 we are reaching out to them.

 

[1:05:40] We're starting to do that outreach and let's go ahead and budget maybe roughly an hour and a half per lead that we go out for. Okay. So, for those 197 prospects, we're going to spend close to 900 hours. We add that up and divide by the work week. That's roughly 90 days. Okay.

 

[1:06:10] Then from that group, let's say we because we qualified pretty hard, like they were good prospects. Let's say we close at 30%. Okay. So, at the end of that 90 days on an average, we're looking at about 60 clients. Follow. Okay.

 

[1:06:35] So, the return rate I've got here in the last column for the emeralds who care, it's a 2% return because off off of that initial lead list, you're just really you're closing 2% right at that. Okay.

 

[1:06:55] Let's look at brute force real quick. Brute force, same thing. Okay, the difference is spending no time on qualification. That 15 minutes, we're giving it back to them. But guess what? They're spending a lot of time trying to close the deal and it adds up to almost like a year year's worth of time. Okay?

 

[1:07:20] But when they do that, the closing rate goes lower, right? Because you can't close most of them because you didn't do the research. You don't really understand what they want. You don't understand what they need. But you do at the end of that year, you do close 75. Okay.

 

[1:07:45] So, and of course that return rate you have to look at it as over 90 days is the first row over one year is is the second row. Are you guys following me here?

 

[1:08:00] What I'm trying to say is in 90 days you've already closed 60 clients. Okay? Versus the traditional smile and dial. I don't care about my lead list. You gave that list to me. I'm just going to send out the emails. I'm going to change the name on the template. I'm going to add one customized word on that template. I'm just going to send it out. I'm just going to make that phone call. Okay.

 

[1:08:35] So, what does that mean? That means that over time and of course this is just a case example of something that I've seen happen in the field right so over time you may have a situation right this may not be a 30% close rate might be 15 20% but it doesn't matter.

 

[1:09:00] Over time you will have spent less time closing almost the same amount of leads maybe a fourth of the time closing almost the same amount of clients because you did hard qualification.

 

[1:09:20] All right. How many how many of you guys can see how this works? You can actually, if you want to build this out in your own spreadsheet, change the numbers, say, "Okay, I'm not closing at 30%. I'm closing at 10%." And figure out what that looks like for you.

 

[1:09:45] Because not everybody's spending 15. I like to spend at least 30 to 45 minutes per lead just so that I can squeeze all the juice. Okay.

 

[1:10:00] In a nutshell, I've highlighted some stuff in yellow, but are you guys starting to see why hard qualification can actually make a difference? I see Kimberly there. Hey, Kimberly.

 

[1:10:20] So my point is if you qualify harder it could lead to more money in your pipeline and those closed right the number of deals closed because you spent the time. I almost I almost want to say this guys I mean traditional smile and dial like no research is wasting your own time.

 

[1:10:45] So question I have for you is like as a ultra high ticket closer, do you have the luxury to waste the time?

 

[1:11:00] All right. So we got root number one which is thinking big. And then we have route number two, which really drives us to doing the right thing with our list of prospects. Is everybody okay with that as a strong base for your tree?

[1:12:20] Seeing a lot of me's and yeses within the chat. Oh, see no, not me. Not really. Yeah, I I will tell you guys just to be kind of vulnerable for a second, I am not the most optimistic person.

 

[1:12:40] And Donna, are you are you optimistic yourself? Really depends on the situation. Yeah. For me, the optimism was very very strongly crafted by kind of my childhood.

 

[1:13:00] So, I always had some of some of our Asian brothers and sisters here might might identify with this. I had really really not a rough childhood, but my my parents actually gave me a lot of negative lower self-energy.

 

[1:13:25] To the to the extent where in my mind I had almost like a shadow of a voice that would always tell me, "Hey, you're probably not going to be able to do that, right? You can't do that. That's not going to work. Are you crazy?"

 

[1:13:45] Right? How many of you guys have have had some of those those voices? That's that's that's a lower self thing. So, it just depends kind of your background, right? So, optimism is going to be one of the key things that will make your tree your your money tree very strong.

[1:14:15] And here's a quote we just pulled off, but basically I love the way that this works and I think it's so true. Right, Donna? Can you read this?

 

[1:14:30] Many an optimist has become rich by buying out a pessimist. How many of you guys have can imagine how that works?

 

[1:14:45] See, Shang says, "Well, let me think about this. An optimist buying out a pessimist becoming rich off of that." Garrett gets. Garrett gets it. Yeah. Garrett gets it.

 

[1:15:05] Godford says thinking about the reaction time it's quicker. Yeah. Think about in a market economy and we we'll talk we'll talk stock stock market for a second. Who's the optimist here? Is it the seller or the buyer?

 

[1:15:25] There you go, Greg. Buy low, sell high, right? Unless you're shorting the stock, right? But if you're shorting the stock, and this you guys can go look up the terminology. If you're if you're buying short or you're shorting a stock, are you the optimist or are you the pessimist?

 

[1:15:50] Let's keep the shorts out. Yeah. So, if I short a stock, that just means I think the company's going to go that the worth the value of the company is going to go down.

 

[1:16:10] So I love this quote because optimism many an optimist has become rich by buying out pessimists. So basically the people if you look at an economy or a market economy people who are selling are trying to get out of something right.

 

[1:16:30] I don't want my car anymore. I want to sell it. Why why don't you want it anymore? Well, I don't think it runs good. I think it's kind of it's five years old and it's not stylish anymore. I want a Tesla. Right?

 

[1:16:50] So the pessimist is selling the car, the old used car. The optimist is is saying, "Hey, you know what? That car is only five years old. It runs great. You got a good record. Never any accidents, right? Wheels are good. Tires look good. You kept it in good shape. It's good color. My mom's going to love it."

 

[1:17:15] Like this is this is the difference between somebody who's optimistic, right, versus a pessimist. That that's just kind of a very simple example, but in sales you'll see that, right?

 

[1:17:35] So, we want to be we don't want to be the extreme optimist, but we we do want to leverage the powerful force, the powerful mindset of optimism.

[1:18:15] Big policies. Big and small policies, right? They they sell this an insurance company. They sell policies. So, they did a study.

 

[1:18:30] Essentially, the study looked at whether or not these sales agents who are in operation were able to sell versus whether or not they were optimists or pessimists or somewhere in between, right?

 

[1:18:50] Over the course of two years, they found out that it actually made a big difference whether or not they were optimistic as a person, as people versus how much they actually sold.

 

[1:19:10] So imagine you could go from and you could take on the mindset of optimism and you can boost your sales by by a magnitude of 50% or more just from being optimistic. What would that look like? Right?

 

[1:19:30] So, this is why optimism is such an important mindset for any salesperson and that's that's one that I want to touch upon today. Mainly because of the numbers we'll talk about in a second, but that's optimism.

[1:19:55] Second one, I don't know if you've heard of this one. It's hunger. Hungry. Hunger. Be hungry. Okay. Where have we heard of this one before, Dana?

 

[1:20:10] Success doesn't come to those who are the most intelligent or the most talented. Success comes to those who are the most hungry.

 

[1:20:25] That sounds f Oh, yeah. Some Sandra says red suit. Yeah, this was a this was one of my favorite this Sorry, this is a low res, but this was one of my favorite talks.

 

[1:20:45] I love the the hunger analogy and the fact that if you're hungry enough, like the mindset of hunger is so powerful. If you're hungry enough, you'll figure out a way, right? You'll figure out a way. The hunger just just breaks through all of those excuses.

 

[1:21:10] How many of you guys just from joining HTC have seen that in action? Have you guys started going back and and leveraging some of that hunger to actually produce even more results than you've ever seen before and this is why right optimism and hunger actually go hand in hand.

NÚMEROS: 130+ rejeições em 3 meses (caso UHTC)

 

VISUAL: Comparação de números de rejeição, boxer se levantando após queda

 

[1:21:40] So if you look at the numbers we had in the last case, the person who was in the ultra high ticket position, even with all of the deals that he was screening and going through and actually closing on a higher, you know, order of magnitude than the traditionalist.

 

[1:22:05] Even with all that, he would have been rejected 130 times in these deals on average in three months. Okay, rejection. It's the same.

 

[1:22:25] So, we go back to Sefue's TED talk. Do you remember the the analogy of the boxer or the person who was asked to come into the boxing ring? What happened to that guy in the ring?

 

[1:22:45] The kid got knocked down. Not not quite knocked out. Keith says knock out. Not quite knocked out. If he got knocked out, it would have been harder to to regain consciousness and get up. But but what did he do? He got up. He got up and then he was challenged, right?

 

[1:23:10] So again, this is the this is the this is the situation, guys. This is not I'm not talking about HTC. I'm not talking about regular sales. If you are operating at that much higher level, if you're thinking that much bigger, do you think you'll have more rejections or less rejections?

 

[1:23:35] Yeah, it's it's going to be crazy. You're gonna you're going to develop a callous for it. I I don't know if Adam wants to share a little bit about that, but you you just when when we were doing video prospecting, it's like number one, it took time, right? You had to sit there, learn the process, get in the rhythm.

 

[1:24:00] You it still took time. And you could send a bunch of videos out in the first two, four weeks and like literally nobody's saying anything. And we actually had I I actually had people that just rejected me straight up and said, "No, thank you. Pass like somebody just said, right?"

 

[1:24:25] So, there is a rejection and there's going to be a higher level of rejection from B2B deals because it's not normal people rejecting you anymore. It's actually somebody who is educated, who has money, who has control and power.

 

[1:24:45] And those are the people that are telling you no or not at this time. The optimist will say what he meant was not at this time. Right?

 

[1:25:05] All right. So that's the second quality. So two qualities actually let's go back. What are the two roots again? Let's see the two roots or the two qualities. Two roots. Okay. They getting it.

 

[1:25:25] We got the think ultra and the second one is qualify harder. Qualify harder. Then moving into the mindset. We have two mindsets. One is going to be optimism and hunger.

 

[1:25:45] These are so critical, so overlooked, but I promise you that's going to be your roots and your unshakable trunk.

[1:26:25] I'm going to call this section for now strategic company research and it's going to focus on one framework which it is is kind of widely available but it depends on where you're reading it people write about it differently.

[1:27:10] Here's basically what's going on here when you have a big list. Okay, you're going to of course filter through that list. You're going to look at different maybe some of you guys are lead scoring, right?

 

[1:27:30] Maybe some of you guys are looking at demographics, geography, revenues, you know, all those things. You get to narrow it down. You'll have your targeted list, right?

 

[1:27:50] Then from your targeted list, maybe you're going in and you're what people are saying online and here's where I want to call the difference out is some people are calling this the dream 100 list, the traditional dream 100 list of sales.

 

[1:28:15] Which is really an ultra I could say it's an ultra-targeted list, but but I don't want to use the word ultra yet. It's simply the the customers, right, or the potential customers, we say prospects that are actually more likely to spend more with you more quickly in a shorter amount of time, right?

 

[1:28:40] They're they're going to spend more with you. They're going to be the the bang for buck customers, the customers that you just got to have. That's your dream list.

 

[1:29:00] Though. If you come up and do your filtration, you're filtering through and you have a hundred of those good ones. That's your dream 100 sales list. Does everybody agree with that? You guys have seen that before, right? Somewhere. All right.

[1:29:25] So, what I want to introduce to you guys is something that we call the ultra 100 list. Okay? And this is a different type of dream 100. If you see it online, you also see dream 100s being described this way. And that's okay.

 

[1:29:45] But within our kind of community, we'll just call it Ultra 100. Is that okay with you guys? Okay.

 

[1:30:00] So, here's an example of how one company describes it. And again, we're going to talk about filtration, different stages, right? If you take a large list of let's say 2500 leads, you go through, you map stuff out.

 

[1:30:20] Get rid of the ones that are not in the right revenue category, growth trajectory, look at geography, look at the industry, right? Look at where the customers are. Look at what kind of relationships.

 

[1:30:40] Okay, so what's actually happening here is you're trying you're starting to see here this might not actually be a client list. This is actually just a simple company list.

 

[1:31:00] Why am I starting to say it this way? These are now I want you to think of ultra 100 list is actually a list of partners. Okay? It's not unlike what some of you guys have mentioned here.

 

[1:31:20] But that top 50 to 100 target list at the very right side at the very end of this filtration process is actually when you've actually analyzed what these companies are doing and you find these companies actually do something similar with the same culture, the same values.

 

[1:31:45] Maybe they're complimentary, you would be able to take these guys and put them on a list.

[1:32:05] Here's an example. Donna, do you want to take this one? Yes, if there was 100 clients that if you've got them all, you could dramatically increase your business.

 

[1:32:25] The goal of the 100 list is to take your ideal buyers from I've never heard of this company to what is this company I keep hearing about to I think of I've heard of that company to yes, I've heard of that company to yes, I do business with that company.

 

[1:32:50] How many of you guys have on your shelf and and I highly recommend that if your shelf is missing this valuable component, you need to replenish it. You need you need to put it back on there.

 

[1:33:10] How many of you guys have the ultra um I think I put ultra in in place of it should be ultimate, right guys? You can see my mind was on ultra. Ultimate sales machine by Chad Holmes. Okay, you guys got to keep that on your on your bookshelf there.

 

[1:33:35] Is this what we've described here, the the quote from Chat Holmes, is that the dream 100 that we're talking about here with Ultra 100 or is that the traditional sales sales 100 sales dream 100?

 

[1:33:55] See, Adam says yes, it's more the traditional. That's right, Aaron. It's more traditional because Chad talks about this as really those are the clients that you are trying to get excited, right?

 

[1:34:15] Eventually, they're going to come back and and say, "Hey, I would do business with you in a heartbeat, right? The the the message is the messaging around this from Chad's point of view is closer to the traditional, I would say, than what I'm about to show you." Okay?

 

[1:34:40] I think I think it's the the dream 100 term has been has floated around for for quite some time now. So, it's it's it's kind of evolved. And I want you guys to think about partnerships rather than sales. And I'll tell you why.

[1:35:20] And of course, if you have a CRM, it looks much better than this. But you can see, okay, I've got company, I've got website, I can go do research from the website, right? I've got the name, I can go look this guy up on LinkedIn. I've got their role in the company, right?

 

[1:35:45] Spreadsheets are the basic thing. So, if you guys aren't on those yet, make sure you understand how to leverage a spreadsheet for quick scoring and quick sorting through all your leads.

[1:36:30] That's good. I mean, we've got we got people with some some experience. Some some of you I I'll be honest with you. I've actually done a limited lead scoring with my my engagements. It's been mostly spreadsheets and me doing the manual tallies.

 

[1:36:55] Some of this is made easier through technology, right guys? CRM. Yeah, Bobby and I are on the same same page. We're spreadsheet guys.

 

[1:37:15] So this is this is another way to start upgrading your research level. Okay. So lead scoring gives you a better handle on on how warm, how engaged that lead is before you touch them, before you sometimes before you even do more of the basic research.

[1:37:45] I want to point this out to you. And I know I'm flying through this. It's going to connect in one second. There's a video actually it's not a video I believe it's actually a blog post that we have this image here on danlock.com how to get to clients fast and this is one thing I was waiting for one of you guys to elaborate earlier but it's we call it the kingpin approach.

 

[1:38:15] Have you guys heard of this kingpin? So as we think about those lists guys right think about that spreadsheet you have to start thinking ultra which means those names don't look these do not look the same anymore.

 

[1:38:40] Okay, I'll give you an example. Look at look at column E. Look at these roles here in the company. We see mostly VP of sales. Correct? We see national sales manager. We see d sales director. We see partner manager, right? These are all different roles.

 

[1:39:05] Now, think of think of this link back to what we call the kingpin. How many of you guys know the origin of the kingpin strategy or the kingpin terminology? Where does it come from?

 

[1:39:25] B says Breaking Bad. Yeah, Renu. It's kind of super connectors actually comes from and I have to I have to read more about this because I find this so interesting.

 

[1:39:45] It comes from Bogdan. You're absolutely right about that. It comes from the idea that you take out that one person. This comes from the the drug cartels and and the strategies the CIA and FBI tried to use to take out the drug cartels in South America.

 

[1:40:10] They would go after the leaders rather than going after the dealers, right? Think about it that way. How many of you guys have been going after the dealers, the drug dealers, when you should have been going after the head honcho, the guy at the top?

 

[1:40:35] What did Bogdan say? He says, the pin that holds everything together. Yeah, the idea of the kingpin strategy is is simple.

 

[1:40:50] So, Sefue talks about it too in a couple of his videos. If you find the right contact, you actually get access to the entire rest of the organization, right?

 

[1:41:10] And I want you guys to be careful about this because look, just because you have the VP of sales, does that mean you have the ear of the CEO or the CTO if you're selling software? No, not necessarily, but it could be. You might have a chance.

 

[1:41:35] Just because this guy's only a sales director, right, EJ? Just because he's only a sales director, does that mean you don't have the ear of the CTO, the chief technology officer? No, not necessarily. But you got to find out, right?

 

[1:42:00] You can make some assumptions, but you got to find out who's controlling the direction of that department, that company, who controls the budget. Everybody following me here?

 

[1:42:20] Is this a strategy that gets you multiples? The kingpin strategy. All right.

[1:42:40] Let's move to our friend Russell. Russell. Okay, I realized that there were probably 100 people who already had my dream customers. They had the traffic. I didn't need to create it. I just needed to figure out how to get those people to come and see my new opportunity.

 

[1:43:05] Oh, sorry. I think we probably missed a piece of that. Can you start from the top? I think it's it's my connection, actually. Go ahead.

 

[1:43:20] Okay. So, I realized that there were probably 100 people who already had my dream customers. They had the traffic. I didn't need to create it. I just needed to figure out how to get those people to come and see my new opportunity instead.

 

[1:43:45] This is Russell Brunson, good friend of Sefue. They're go they're both very good friends. He's the author, co-founder of ClickFunnels, multi-million dollar company with zero VP funding.

 

[1:44:05] If you guys know the the background, ClickFunnels, simply amazing, right? These this if you think about kingpin strategy, if you think about like like growing in in multiples, Russell is one of the guys that you you guys should study.

 

[1:44:30] So, I I'll I'll tell you guys if you if you he's got a whole series of books, right, the funnel books that you guys if you haven't checked out at least one or two of those, check those out. He's got some really cool stuff in there.

[1:44:55] How does that relate to ultra 100s? Well, if you go into Russell's reading, you'll find that he refers to dream 100, which is what we talk about as ultra 100. So, this is all about the kingpin strategy.

 

[1:45:15] It's not necessarily selling to those 100 people directly and getting them to buy something, right? It's actually leveraging, which some of you guys have said in the chat, yes, expert secrets is one of my favorite books.

 

[1:45:35] Here's what you do if you're if you're Russell, right? If you're trying to control traffic, here's what you do. His dream, his idea of an ultra 100 list looks like this.

 

[1:45:55] He's taking his network of people, right? He's built up a list of the top ideal partners and he can take he can do two things with these guys. Okay, I want you guys to listen carefully. This is really cool.

 

[1:46:15] He can either I'm going to start with the one on the bottom. He can actually buy his way into a list. When I say list, I mean that's a list of list of prospects or a list of leads, right? He could pay his way in to get access to those leads.

 

[1:46:40] Or he could do another way. He can also partner and actually work with this person. Let's say they get together and do a joint venture where Russell's interviewing or creating some kind of product together with somebody who owns the owns the list.

 

[1:47:05] And by nature of that, he's created a product, he's put in the work, he's put in the effort, he now gets access to that list. So either way he does it, either he pays it through cash, right, to buy access to that list or he does a partnership, he eventually owns the leads on that list, right?

 

[1:47:30] You guys seeing how this works? Now, going back to the concept, are we selling to that list directly? Not necessarily. Right.

 

[1:47:50] So, is this kind of like kingpin a little bit because we've grabbed the the key contacts for that list. So, are you guys seeing how this this is the scalable? This is the the orders of magnitude we're talking about the ultra 100 list. Okay.

 

[1:48:15] So, how does this you got to think think for a second. How does this relate to what you're doing today with your list of let's say I'm assuming some of you guys are still looking for closing opportunities, right?

 

[1:48:35] Some of you guys let's let's talk about that for a second and some of you guys who are looking for closing opportunities are actually building your list, right? Building your your dream 100.

 

[1:48:55] Are there is there anything that you can do now that you know about leveraging this that would change the way that you structure and filter for that list.

 

[1:49:15] See what everybody's saying here. Scott's going after his first B2B. Congratulations. Bo says, "Let's check out who's connected to who. Bugton says there is an issue. If you can type in there, we'll get we'll come back and address that.

 

[1:49:40] So, I want you guys to think about your you're no longer remember we talk about lone wolf versus working with others. As a salesperson, is it okay to work with others to get to the the contacts and leads that you need?

 

[1:50:00] Yeah, why not? Everybody else is doing it. So, if you're not doing it, you're you're probably going to be the the only one that's not leveraging that, right?

[1:50:25] So, if you think about it this way, the the first thing you got to remember that if you're building an Ultra 100 list, the first thing you think about are shared values. Okay?

 

[1:50:45] So shared values meaning there's some core values in the way you operate as a salesperson for your company and the way that your company views its products and services.

 

[1:51:05] Those values should be in line and this is assuming you're closing for for a company closing B2B for a company. Those values of the company should be in line with those people that you're trying to target. Right?

 

[1:51:25] You got to have that other otherwise you'll end up selling selling stuff to a list that actually is not aligned to those values and you'll have a hard time trying to get them to to pick up on those.

[1:51:50] So, here's some tactical things that you can do. I know we're we're talking strategy and research here, but let's let's talk a couple of tactical things to build your build your list. You guys okay with that? Yes.

 

[1:52:10] Bogdan, let's take a quick moment. Let me read Bogdan's comment here. Issue is getting permission. Yes, knowing the boundaries. We'll talk let's why don't we do this? Remind me.

 

[1:52:30] We're going to talk about that. I've got a slide around the collaboration piece and how you might be able to structure that conversation. Is that okay?

 

[1:52:50] That's right. So, we cannot take prospects from Sefue's YouTube audience and qualify them and bring them into the funnel yourself. Yes, that is not permitted and that would be that would be bad.

 

[1:53:10] So, here's an idea. So, step one, take a list of if you guys don't know that the company that you're working for, what are the things that they value as a company? It's probably one place you want to start, right?

 

[1:53:30] You could start with a list of values here and just kind of think about, okay, if I'm back in my day, I was working for Dell. Just think about, okay, what does Dell care about as a company?

 

[1:53:50] I know they they're big on customer service. That's one thing. They're also big on maybe it's commitment, right? Making sure that we execute to what we commit to. The other one is quality. We measure quality actively and we you know we we run a lot of reports on quality.

 

[1:54:15] Like you have to go through and first do this mapping so that you can come up with a better list and make sure that you're not including companies that don't match that brand value.

[1:55:00] You could do it by size. So maybe you have some customers or some partners that are enterprise level partners. Maybe you have small medium business SMB as an example. This is just an example here.

 

[1:55:20] And you have some c some some partners that serve a market as more high-touch, right? That require much more attention. Maybe they work on clients that have longer deal cycles, high touch, right?

 

[1:55:40] Or you may have a set of your list is actually quite quite quick. I mean the very low-maintenance type of customers, right? So what you want to do is step two is you create that the longer list. You want to create some separate buckets so that you can address those separately. Make sense?

[1:56:25] All right, here's Bogdan. Let's take a look at this together. Okay, so Ultra 100. Here's here are some things you can do. And we're going to be careful with how we do it. Okay, and and step three is really looking at how they actually serve.

 

[1:56:50] So we obviously this list when you look at it these partners have to have some clients but we're not we should not be in competition with what we're offering. They should be complimentary right.

 

[1:57:10] So maybe okay just bought a friend just bought a car the other day. So if a company's selling cars, maybe the complimentary company at a same level with the same values, maybe that company's offering a what do they call that? A clear coat insurance type of application to the car.

 

[1:57:35] You know how dealerships like to upsell you on that kind of stuff when you buy the car? My friend was telling me about that. So you got the car and then you have another company that's offering not the car, not parts of the car, but just a coating that goes on the outside of the car that's a complimentary service that complements that product, but it's a different company.

 

[1:58:00] So how did those guys collaborate and get to the that deal where any customer that comes through the door the dealership gets sold both the car and also that coding? You guys following me here so far?

[1:58:30] All right, let me walk you through this. This this table is a little bit confusing, but we have three boxes on the left. Three boxes across the top. Boxes across the top would be your your ultra 100 partners components and then of course on the left side is your stuff. Okay.

 

[1:58:55] There's three things. Either you have a list of customers, either you have a list of customers or a list of opportunities, and then you have a list of prospects. What's the difference?

 

[1:59:15] Your prospects are going to be the least qualified, right? The opportunities are those that are almost on the verge of closing a deal or entering into a deal. And then the customers are already paying. That's the difference. Okay.

 

[1:59:40] So, how do you combine these two things? So, let's say let's take the top. Let's take the middle actually. Let's say we have a list of our opportunities, deals that are almost closed, right?

 

[2:00:00] And then you also work with your partner and your partner also has a list of opportunities. Not closed yet. Very, very hot. Almost done with the deal.

 

[2:00:20] So what could happen is you guys can collaborate and say hey you know what what if we actually work together to sell right these guys are maybe we can work together and actually does not have to be a complimentary kind of they're selling stuff on the same page necessarily but it can be as simple as what do you know of your because we have the same remember the partner and my company have the same brand values right so we have stuff in common.

 

[2:00:50] So this could even just be as simple as learning from your partner on how to sell better, right? How can we sell to these? We're almost done with the deal. I mean, how are you pushing these guys from opportunity to customer?

 

[2:01:10] And then he's he's telling he's sharing with me and I'm also sharing with them, right? That's one that's one scenario.

 

[2:01:25] Let's say I have a list of my prospects. I haven't been able to move them into the deal stage. So, this is I'm not sure if you guys can see my mouse cursor, but the list of prospects. Okay.

 

[2:01:45] And again, I have also the list of the partners' opportunities. Well, these guys are hot, right? This on the partners' list, that list is hot.

 

[2:02:00] So, what we could do is work together and do a bundled type of selling opportunity, which turns these prospects into either warmer opportunities or closes them into customers.

 

[2:02:20] So that they go they jump from this category prospects into customers and the partners opportunities are also jumping into the customer bucket.

 

[2:02:40] Bogdan says he's he's done this a lot. That's good. So there's an opportunity to collaborate just depending on what stage and you can do these categorizations and you can actually sit down and do what we used to do at team Danlock is we sat down and actually created joint venture opportunities right.

 

[2:03:05] We took a look at what Sefue was doing or maybe there was something somebody out there an influencer or a company where they have same values but they're offering something different but we bundled it together or we offer we came together and did a completely new product and we co we co-sold that product. Right?

 

[2:03:30] So again, step three is to take a look at the the customer sets and also your assets depending on what you have in terms of lists and what you what you're able to share between you and the partner where you're not competing. Does that make sense guys?

 

[2:03:55] This is very high level by the way. Okay.

[2:04:10] This is the probably the most important part. This links back into last week we talked about intentional. Does everybody remember intentional frequency?

 

[2:04:30] You want to get to know these guys. We're calling them influencers here because they can influence the market, the target market that you're after, too. Okay.

 

[2:04:50] So overall, when you're building this list every day, I would say put this thing in front of you, print it out, post up on the wall next to your desk, you have to make it part of daily routine.

 

[2:05:10] Like, what am I doing to get closer to these guys to understand them more? Because if you just build a list and you don't do anything with it, what good is the list?

 

[2:05:30] When you look at this activity, the ultra 100 list, is this a high priority type of activity for you? Heidi says yes. Adam says no. Couple people saying yes. It's critical.

 

[2:05:50] Is this a let me ask a second question. Is this an immediate return activity? No. But over time, does it pay off in multiples?

 

[2:06:10] So you guys see how how important this is, right? So everybody start thinking if some of you have already taken the the initiative to do some of this work but we have to make sure that this is a list and everybody's got their own list and we have to spend time getting to know these people.

VISUAL: Lista de perguntas estratégicas sobre relacionamento com parceiros

 

[2:06:40] Couple of final questions I would ask in your outreach with people using this list, if you're creating this list, is how do these other companies and their clients relate directly to your business?

 

[2:07:00] Okay, it's not just the values, the brand values. Other little links. If you look at trying to think of a good example, I gave you the car example with the with the the insurance or the the coding.

 

[2:07:20] But you got to figure out also what does the customer journey look like, right? When they're going through that checkout process in in terms of buying a car, where does it make sense? Like where can we add value?

 

[2:07:40] What do they look what are their pains? Like I just got sold a car. Maybe when I get home is when I finally realize that, hey, I just got sold a car, but like my car is naked. I got no protection over on the car, right? Maybe that's a pain point, right?

 

[2:08:05] Does it make sense to insert yourself as a partner solution in the checkout process of buying a car in this example? Buying a car, money in the future. That's right. What are the domino effects?

 

[2:08:25] This is this is key. See if talks about this all the time and those of you who are in the sales team Danlock sales team you guys will see this too. See if always says you know what what's the what's the one thing we can what's the kingpin?

 

[2:08:45] What's the what's the domino effect that we can impact upstream that will just take care of the rest of it. Right? Stop thinking transactionally. Stop looking at the we talk about the drug dealers and the drug lords. Stop looking at the drug dealers.

 

[2:09:10] I know this this is a bad example, but stop looking at the drug dealers. Look at the drug lords. Where are those guys? Right. You can think of it. Yes, Scott.

 

[2:09:30] You think of it, think upstream or get to the root of what's happening. What are the and Desmond likes to say this too is what are the small hinges that swing the big doors? Okay.

 

[2:09:50] And then finally, when you look at execution, are there any lower-hanging fruit? Meaning, is there something that you can do immediately and quickly to affect that that change and and get people to to see the value in what you do as a salesperson. Okay.

 

[2:10:15] Some some of the things some of the other contacts, some of the other strategies may be a little bit harder. They take longer to set up. They take more time. So, maybe there's something we can take on and get started.

 

[2:10:35] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "The Third Door Strategy"

 

NÚMEROS: Não especificados

 

VISUAL: Três portas: Front Door, Back Door, Third Door (kingpin approach)

 

[2:10:40] Question for you is which door are you guys using currently? Gail says Gary Keller says what's the one thing you can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier unnecessary. I love that. It's a good one.

 

[2:11:00] Ultra thinking. Position yourself as a hinge. I like that. Okay, we got hinges now. We got the door analogy. We've got the wolves. Like, what else do we need? We've got almost all of it color.

 

[2:11:20] The the third door approach. If you guys haven't how many of you guys have seen the video that see if we put out about the third door? I'm going to test you guys since you guys are ultra. Where was that video filmed? That's a test.

 

[2:11:45] VG. Was it? Are you sure, Adam? This graphic looks like it is. But I'm not even sure this is the same one. I I remember the very first video he talked about the third door. He actually filmed it in Japan. You guys remember that?

 

[2:12:10] Chris, you you got to remember it, man. You were there. Okay. He's going through the the columns coming down the stairs. You guys go back and watch it. Okay.

 

[2:12:30] Third door strategy is the kingpin strategy. It's the other way. Everybody's going through the front door. Everybody's going after the drug dealers when they should be going after the drug lords. Okay.

 

[2:12:50] So question always ask yourself which door am I using and that's what I have to say about strategic research. Okay. So does that give you a better frame on how to strategy-wise, right? How to not get in the weeds, how to elevate yourself so that you can you can impact more of that audience in less time.

 

[2:13:15] We went through this fast. All right, questions. Let's take some questions and we'll go on a break.

 

[2:13:30] Yes. So, make sure you put your questions into Discord. It could be questions or if you guys want to do aha moment that's fine as well. Just make sure you raise your hand so we can see you.

 

[2:13:50] Do we want to mute unmute him? Yes, please. Rich. Okay. Thank you. I see Joseph has his hand on hand up. Okay, let's hear from Joseph. You can unmute yourself, Joseph.

 

[2:14:15] Joseph, you're still unmuted. Joseph, we'll come back to you in a second. Okay. So, make sure you raise your hands within Zoom. That way I we can select on you.

 

[2:14:35] I see Bogdan has his hand up again. Let's take a let's take a question from Bo. We haven't heard from Bo in in a bit. B's Bo's got a good question. It's a it's a very philosophical question.

 

[2:14:55] Okay. When getting started building the pipeline, is patience more important or impatience? Can can we get Bo on the line? Actually, can we unmute B?

 

[2:15:15] You can unmute yourself, Bo. Hello. Hello. Try ticket community. Hello. Hello. Hey. Hey, Mr. Rich. Long time no talk. Long time. Long time. Yes.

 

[2:15:40] My question is when getting started building the pipeline, is patience more important or impatience?

 

[2:15:55] That's a good question. So, so let let me dig a little bit deeper into that question because the patience could be defined a little bit differently. So when you think about patience, what does that typically refer to for you?

 

[2:16:15] For me, that refers to people that are not ready. And thinking of it from an investment standpoint, is it better to plant those seeds or is it to go and find the fruits that are ready?

 

[2:16:40] This is again very very the theoretical. So, so my immediate response to that is it's actually you you actually cannot have one without the other. You you cannot find the seeds that you want without disqualifying. Does that make sense?

 

[2:17:00] So, you're going through the process. Inevitably, as you start, you're going to end up in your lap naturally, you're going to have a list that's not that great, but you're doing research on.

 

[2:17:20] So during the phase of research, you're going to have to build up that patience, right, to get through and make sure that you're disqualifying with enough time to to vet, make sure that you have the information about the company and about the prospect, right?

 

[2:17:45] But at the same time, on a higher level, when you look at your calendar and your schedule, you want to make sure that you're impatient, too, because you want to squeeze as much time out and be as efficient with that time as possible.

 

[2:18:05] But that's that that's the way that's the way I would see it initially. Impatience also applies to research too. I mean obviously like you get to define everybody here has a different tolerance for how much research is being put in. Right?

 

[2:18:30] So let's say let's not even talk minutes here. Let's we talked about people going from 15 minutes to 30 minutes to 45 minutes of research per contact on average. Well, what's actually going in there?

 

[2:18:50] Are we looking at company? Are we looking at social media for that person? Are we looking at company news, news releases? Right? Are you checking all of those boxes off?

 

[2:19:10] And if you do, is that for you, Bo? Is that being patient or is that being impatient?

 

[2:19:25] Making sure that all the boxes are checked off. I would say that that is I would say that that's that's impatient. You are impatiently pursuing who you believe is a good prospect.

 

[2:19:45] And you but but at the same time right Bo you've predefined what is a good set of check boxes to check off correct. Correct. Right you've given yourself criteria or sorry not yourself but you've given these companies a set of criteria by which you can judge them right.

 

[2:20:10] Are you cutting corners when you do this, are you saying, "Hey, you know what? This I don't want to I don't feel like doing the rest of this checklist. I think I get a I get a handle just by looking at the front page of this company that I don't I don't want to deal with this company, right? Is that does that happen?"

 

[2:20:35] Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, I mean there's there's certain criteria on the checklist which are if you if you think about it, it's like you've done enough research to know that just by looking at two of those boxes, you know that this guy's not going to pass, right?

 

[2:20:55] So you don't actually have to go through the motions and be patient about it that way. You can simply just move on.

 

[2:21:10] Okay. So, if if I may if I may interpret what you're saying that it's it's not a matter of should you be planting or should you be reaping. It's a matter of you want to do as much of both as you can at the same time to ultimately find what the best fruits are.

 

[2:21:35] Yeah. And again, this you bring up a great side note, which is the when you when you talk about seed, a seed is not always ready to start sprouting, right? Just because you find a seed, it looks like it's not ready, you put it back in the bag, right?

 

[2:21:55] Or you you put it back into the into the sand or into the dirt and you still have to wait for that the right time for it to start sprouting. But does that mean that it wasn't worth actually looking at that seed and seeing what stage it was at? Not necessarily. Right?

 

[2:22:20] Because now you have a handle. And again, we go back to the the first part of this class which is the data that you come across is so important because even as you disqualify, what do you have now that you can go back to marketing team with? Data. You see what I'm getting at, Bo?

 

[2:22:45] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. That's that's setting up the nets, setting up the fishing rods, for sure.

 

[2:22:55] But but you're you're you're going back to marketing with the data. And then what is marketing doing theoretically, too? They're getting better at providing the the resources and the support to give you a better list over time.

 

[2:23:15] There's the pack. Yeah. And then that you're leveraging the pack and now you have a better list after 2 3 months and now you're closing at a higher rate because the list got better. But you you couldn't have done that if you didn't sift through all those bad leads.

 

[2:23:40] Very wise. Cool. Thank you for your question, Bo. Hope all is well.

 

[2:23:55] Can we take maybe one more question? Yes, I saw some questions here in the chat. Now, here's a question from William. What if we were researching the influencer but didn't find info about the company?

 

[2:24:15] This is from, let me try to scroll up. Is there cont? Okay, got it. William saying, "What if we were researching the influencer but we didn't find any information about the company?" Hm.

 

[2:24:35] Let me ask let me let me redirect the question to you, William. When you're when you don't have enough information about your prospect, what should you do even before you well, there's multiple ways, but let me ask you, what is what is your reflection?

 

[2:24:55] Let's say all all of the other leads you found company information for for, but this particular lead or this particular prospect you couldn't find any information for. What would you do?

 

[2:25:15] Ivan is asking, "Wouldn't that be a red flag?" True, they don't have a website. They're not listed in Google, right? They don't want to do business with the outside world. That could be true, but it depends on what kind of company is as well.

 

[2:25:40] Some companies like to focus on services that are not, you know, widely known. Maybe they're not doing marketing yet. And maybe you're offering marketing to these types of companies, right?

 

[2:26:00] So, so the scenario, it depends. It is strange that you can't find the more information about the company. It could mean the company's just not mature enough yet in its stage of evolution to have that information available. Okay?

 

[2:26:25] When compare, this is all relative. If you have a whole list of these that all look kind of the same, they're all missing information. They can't can't find their website, right? They're not listed or if you if you find that the list is mostly like this, I would say, hey, bad list.

 

[2:26:50] But if it's just an outlier, William, move on. You've got other leads to qualify, right? Yeah, you're ultra high ticket prospector. You you don't need to spend time trying to go with these companies that are not presenting themselves. Does that help?

 

[2:27:15] Okay, one more question. Here was a question from Christian. Practical question. How do you keep from researching the same company twice? Do you keep a disqualified list that doesn't even make it into your CRM?

 

[2:27:40] Okay, very tactical question. Who's this from? Is it Chris? This is from Christian. Yes, Christian. Okay. Hey, Christian.

 

[2:28:00] It's kind of hard to see what the context is. So, it depends like what what tools are you using currently because if you're using one CRM, there are ways usually, right, in most CRM to label a prospect as disqualified.

 

[2:28:25] And so, some of us have used like like a close.io, a HubSpot, there are ways to tag a prospect to say, "Hey, you know what? Prospect is is not ready to buy and you can tag them that way.

 

[2:28:45] And when you filter out your list for the ones that are not that don't have that tag then you'll have the remaining remainder of the list right so that's that's a that's a typical or very common feature you're going to find in any CRM.

 

[2:29:05] Now if you are working off spreadsheets with some which some of us I know we are spreadsheets you go about the problem differently right you will arrange your leads into column and row format.

 

[2:29:25] And you're going to do a filter off of the columns. And when you hit filter, just sort by alphabet or sort by company name. So then you have all of the leads next to each other row on row, if that makes sense. So you'll be able to see that.

 

[2:29:50] You can mark those out or you can remove them from a from the list. Right? Very very tactical question. He color codes them. That's good.

 

[2:30:10] All right, guys. Let's take a quick break. A bio break. Let's see what time is it. Let's do how would you guys feel? Five minutes. Bio break. Five minutes.

 

[2:30:30] And we'll come back and we're going to after the break, we're going to dive right into video prospecting, which is our tactical part of the tree today. We're going to go through a couple of examples and also run through the actual script that we use for video prospecting. Sound good?

 

[2:30:55] 5 minutes. So, let's be back at 58 past the hour. All right. So, make sure you stretch stretch your legs real quick. Take something to drink or something to eat.

 

[2:31:15] And I'm actually looking at chat and I want to see who is paying attention. So, who knows? What do you need to create or have to have that unshakable trunk? Let's see. Who knows?

 

[2:31:40] Hunger. That's right. Optimism. That's right. Now, those are the two unshakable qualities, but what were the roots? Let's see. What were the two money tree roots?

 

[2:32:00] Think ultra and qualify hard. Yes. Yes. That's right. Now let's see in the chat what were some of your main takeaways so far. Not everyone has some same takeaways. So let's see.

 

[2:32:25] Think ultra nets. That's right. Big Ned, find a kingping. Kingpin. That's right. Erin Reie says, "Use a dirt door entry." Interesting.

 

[2:32:45] Ivan says that I have to think bigger. That's right. And I thought I was good since I was starting. Always got to think bigger. Do some research, collaboration, shared values, catch big fish and the rest will follow up. I like that.

 

[2:33:10] Sh says, "Merge customers leads list with a partner." That's right, William. Get the Lord, not the drug dealers. Qualify harder.

 

[2:33:30] All right, I'm back a little early. Get the Lord, not the drug dealers. Actually, a question for the family. When making a video or anything like that, do you normally use a script?

 

[2:33:50] Good question. Let's see in the chat. I see. Donna, do you use a script for your videos? I do. You do? I do.

 

[2:34:10] Why is it so important to use a script, especially when starting out? See if they Muhammad says structure not a script. Organized. William says.

 

[2:34:30] Todd says must use not go on a tangent. Adam says plan your message. Yeah. Kevin says avoid sometimes the stuttering that goes on when we don't have something in front of us to guide us. Right. Yeah.

 

[2:34:55] I know I I completely a big script guy. I'll show you guys what what what I used to do step by step. But even if you guys go back and because it's okay to share this here with you guys, right?

 

[2:35:15] The videos I post on Facebook. I don't post too many, but if you go back to the videos that I posted before, it's kind of hard to tell, but I actually scripted everything out first before recording that video.

 

[2:35:40] And I had to probably, you know, I'm still recording at least, I don't know, six or seven times before I take the final take or take the best take. Right. Donna, do you do that for for your videos as well or you more of like a one take girl?

 

[2:36:05] No. Oh, no. No. It's not in in one go, unfortunately.

 

[2:36:15] I remember like them saying that Sefue like now he's he's so good and he does the he does the YouTube video recordings so often now. He's he's pretty much like one take, two takes max, you can get the message done.

 

[2:36:40] But it comes with so much practice, right? So much experience. All right, let's continue, shall we?

[2:37:00] So, let's talk about video prospecting. And at some point here in the presentation, I will need to switch because I want to share with you a live video being played. So, I will need to switch out of this.

 

[2:37:25] But let's see. We're going to talk about video prospecting the ultra way. And before I get into this, I need to give heavy heavy heavy props or mad props as they say, credit to Jeremy Haynes, part of team Danlock, who trained, spent many hours training us on the bisdev team on how to video prospect.

 

[2:37:55] Because he he had done it for such a long time with such great results and he was able to pass on a lot of the good knowledge around that and elevate our ability to get people to notice us and to get people to want to close deals with us.

 

[2:38:20] So, credit goes to Jeremy for all the training that he he gave us. And in this part of the class tonight, I want to pretty much share most or all of what I learned from Jeremy and through my experiences doing countless countless must have been hundreds and hundreds of takes of videos going out to different companies.

 

[2:38:50] Is that okay with you guys if I share that? I don't I don't expect you guys are going to share this outside of class. We have agreement on that. Cool. Looks like everybody's getting the message. Everybody's back from break, right?

[2:39:20] All right. So very quickly here a couple snapshots of the different videos to give you some context and I want to bring Adam on in a moment because he was there at the same time we were getting trained for this and we had started executing on a long list of contacts.

 

[2:39:50] And what we were trying to do is we were trying to close for essentially two main services. One of them was closers.com and then the second one was copywriters.com. So you guys are probably familiar with both of those.

 

[2:40:15] But really for us the big challenge was hey can we take a list and can we start creating these very very customized videos through extensive research and really try to attract these business owners to come talk to us. That was the whole goal.

 

[2:40:40] Like if I sent a video out, whatever company it was, be it a digital marketing agency, which in most case it was, and let me take take a step back.

 

[2:41:00] Why do you think it was important for us to look at our Ultra 100 list and say, "Hey, digital marketing is one of the industries that fits on that list." I want to take a look and see who's following here. Digital marketing as a category that's on our list.

 

[2:41:25] See, Peter says shared values, leverage kingpin. Yes. Adam says perfect refer for both services. Mhm. Share the same customer target. That's right. I think you guys are getting it.

 

[2:41:50] So shared values maybe not not as much initially. I mean we we definitely looked at the idea that hey you know what digital marketing a marketing agencies were looking for either to sell their services which you know the theoretically higher ticket items that we could close for.

 

[2:42:20] And at the same time digital marketing agencies work you know very often with copywriters and they need teams or if not individuals to to really write good copy for their clients. Right?

 

[2:42:45] So, this is definitely more of a kingpin, a one to many if we get a good agency working with us that we could pull in additional CL target target clients for our business. Does that make sense?

 

[2:43:10] So, you'll see I I just posted six. Of course, there's many many more here. You'll see it ranges from dig digital marketing specifically for medicine. We have for real estate we have general digital marketing agencies as well as even SEO companies that we tried to to loop in and get them to close or at least for us to close services with them. Okay.

NÚMEROS: Não especificados

 

VISUAL: Lista de benefícios: Research-driven, Repeatable, Pattern-based

 

[2:43:50] So I want to ask you guys you guys maybe I'll just go through this list for you first. The reason why video prospecting is great and why we found it so effective and I want to bring Adam in just for a moment here but from my perspective video prospecting at its core is research driven right.

 

[2:44:20] You can't make a video you can't make a good video without actually having it customized with the information you need to talk to that client right you can you can slough off an email and just change a couple paragraphs in there, right? Keep the rest the same. Use a template and send it over to somebody.

 

[2:44:50] But you can't really put out a good video if you don't do heavy research. You guys following me here? But, but there's a big butt. Once you figure out the pattern of how to research, what to leverage, what pieces go into the video, it becomes repeatable. And that's the cool part. Okay.

 

[2:45:20] Let me ask, does a video editing part matter? Yes, it does. We'll talk a little bit about that.

 

[2:45:35] I want to if if Adam is still available here. Adam, are you still up? Yes, I am.

 

[2:45:50] Can you share with us and because I know you've done so much of this, share with us a little bit about your experience about like how much research goes into making a video at least in the beginning and then over time does it get better or did it get better for you?

 

[2:46:15] So in the beginning I would say I was extremely close to the one and a half hours that you that you mentioned and over time then together with the German community I figured out a way to make it faster.

 

[2:46:40] So we actually built a research department as where a few of the closest that were doing nothing else but researching and so therefore they were feeding me the info and we had a framework.

 

[2:47:05] So we were going through all of the social media in a certain order and then we were like researching every single presence that the person could have had and then some people were going through the funnels and listening to the webinars and giving an excerpt of that.

 

[2:47:30] We were going through like all the social media posts. We were reading the different comments under certain posts to see like what is the voice of the client target audience and what is their voice, how do they react.

 

[2:47:55] And so I was focusing on that and then copying the voice of the influencer or the person that we targeted to speak in their voice. And as soon as I was talking about their clients, I was switching my tone of voice so they see that we understand how they speak.

 

[2:48:20] And this is a very subtle thing like high level later on. And it got us great returns. They were like, "Hey, wow, that's a great video. Thank you so much." Like they they liked it very much.

 

[2:48:45] And even some of them were not ready to do business with closers.com. They really appreciated the effort because they could clearly see it.

 

[2:49:05] And later down when we were splitting the efforts, I think the the research time went down to like half an hour to an hour. But if you do it yourself in the beginning, there is no too long because you want to get a feel for it and find all of the pitfalls.

 

[2:49:30] For example, I can share an example that where the research really paid off, we almost would have gotten a scammer in, but because of the intense research that we did, we noticed it.

 

[2:49:55] For example, there was a guy, he was very prolific with YouTube ads. He was like, "Yeah, and I help you like five figures a month and help you so much." B and that was like a wave of German influencers that were all promising you that. They all had the same type of ad.

 

[2:50:20] And we noticed that because we did so much research. And so we looked the guy up and we did find a website but at the same time we looked at the impressum especially guys in Europe look at the impression everybody has to have it in Europe and it's so important.

 

[2:50:45] And we looked at it and according to his impression there was just a wall of text but in reality it wasn't a real legal text. So we could see that he wasn't a real company actually.

 

[2:51:10] And then we were looking it up even more because on his homepage he said he is known from YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, Apple Music and whatever like all the services. And then we researched all of it. No LinkedIn.

 

[2:51:35] That's that's huge. That's huge. Can you guys imagine like if if if if Adam did not put together that team and take the take the time to research on that company, how much time would have been wasted if they he went forward in the process of talking to that company.

 

[2:52:00] Yeah. Hours on end. And for the guys who don't know what an impressive is, it's basically all the information about the company, where it's located, who is the person who is responsible, who's the CEO, who is responsible for the technology, who's responsible for the privacy, and so on. It's really useful.

 

[2:52:30] So therefore we researched that we found that he has no YouTube channel like he has a channel but with three videos and they are dead since like 3 years. He has no podcasts. He has nothing on Apple Music or anywhere.

 

[2:52:55] And his Instagram consisted of three posts of which one the last one at the time when we researched it was congratulations from his mentor to making the first five figures a month. And at the time where we looked at it, it was like three months ago. No, no, sorry, three weeks ago.

 

[2:53:20] So he is marketing that he teaches others to make five figures since months, but he never hit that number himself. And we we found it out and we even called him like we called him and like we all were on a call together and we called the guy and he was like.

 

[2:53:45] We were like, "Dude, you say you are known from YouTube but we don't see on YouTube." Oh yeah, yeah, you don't need to be on YouTube to say you can't be known from YouTube. Like, yeah, dude, you also have no testimonials. And yeah, you don't need testimonials to sell. Like, it's perfectly fine. Like, I had so many clients. Yeah, sure, dude. You made five figures like three weeks ago.

 

[2:54:15] And then suddenly, I ask you this, Adam, too. Like, when you went through that process, I'm sure a couple of us here are wondering, is how do you know when a client is quote unquote video worthy?

 

[2:54:40] I would say I have a very very clear framework in my mind very very clear and I test like in the research process I check out if what they do works like the same framework that you just talked about I focus on is it can we work with the person on the first glance if they pass the first glance we do our research.

 

[2:55:10] Then when the research checks out we go to the third level where we're like going really deep and check like the the back end if possible as much as possible. When that checks out, then I would say it's video worthy.

 

[2:55:35] Yeah. Yeah, that's a that's a great process. And and in my in my opinion too, from my experience, it's once you go through the initial you everybody here has a has their own framework for the initial check, right? If they are worthy of doing business and they make it to your list.

 

[2:56:00] I think everybody if you're if you're if you truly believe and you're a purist around videos, which I was at the time, everybody who looked like a a valid lead, a hot lead, would get a video because because if they were that good of a lead, if that if they were that good of a prospect, why wouldn't I accelerate my chances of trying to get them to notice me, right?

 

[2:56:30] Why wouldn't I send that out as long as I had a as long as I had the research and the process behind it to make the video?

 

[2:56:45] Yeah, that makes sense. And later on like you can also save time when you become faster with the research what you can do. But again like be very very careful to get closer. It is very very important that you first go through the full procedure hundreds of times until you really got it down.

 

[2:57:10] Otherwise you cannot do the next step. Next step would be to have a list and you will become way faster because once you have like the framework you just check it out very quickly and you are very used to it. You see the signs like immediately.

 

[2:57:35] And from there you can do a fake audit. Be very careful with this. You have to be still able to provide very personalized email so they they see it's not a cold call or cold outreach.

 

[2:58:00] The fake audit looks like it's a real video, but when you click on it, it's basically it's a it's a dead picture. It doesn't really work. And this way, you can test. And this only works with prospects that already are super super qualified and you know they will be responsive.

 

[2:58:30] You do enough research on them to formulate a very personalized email where they feel you did put in effort but you still save the time for the video. And when you basically send them the fake audience that hey I made a video for you and where do I send this best.

 

[2:58:55] And when you use this kind of wording even if the click or the audit doesn't work they might think oh he probably just used it to give us an idea of how it looks like. Now we tell him where he should send it.

 

[2:59:20] There are some apps that can do that. Like they can do a fake audit and put it like from their homepage and draw it and it looks like you really recorded a video and when they respond to you say hey oh yeah sure we'd love to see the video then you make it.

 

[2:59:45] Yeah. It's kind of a you've made almost Adam you've created almost like a funnel process for for these guys right with the video at the the second stage. That's great. I love that. Thank you so much.

 

[3:00:10] I want you guys to give give Adam a round of applause because Adam truly has put in his hours to really refine his process and and to have him on the call and share in such great detail, too. Like very very grateful, Adam. Thank you so much for for sharing with us.

 

[3:00:40] Thank you for having me, Rich. It's a pleasure. Thank you. Cool.

[3:01:00] Let's Okay, so here's a quick here's a quick example. I want to show you the actual video. So, I may click out of this in a second, but here's a screenshot of me with my short hair.

 

[3:01:25] I did a this was after maybe three, four weeks of practice just to give you a time frame like when you guys actually watch and listen to this. This will be a three and a half actually four minute video. I'll let you guys watch from start to finish.

 

[3:01:50] The context is you guys can look them look these guys up. They are a credit card consulting a credit card processor consulting company. They have a high ticket offer. They have a very very loyal audience base.

 

[3:02:15] I did the research. I actually even connected with the top sales guy there before actually reaching out to the business owner with this video.

 

[3:02:40] So, what I want you guys to do when I play this video is break your notebooks out and I want you to kind of when you see something that's interesting or something that stood out, I want you to guys to make a little note on the notebook.

 

[3:03:05] Once we finish the the video once over, we'll kind of take a pause and we'll kind of go through and and see what everybody noticed about this video as one version of the outreach that I sent. Is that cool?

 

[3:03:30] Yeah, Bo recognizes that company. This was, by the way, this was a company that did respond. It was one of the first ones that gave us a positive closing conversation later on because of the product that was changing.

 

[3:03:55] They were actually going through an upgrade, try trying to get their their their high ticket offer even higher ticket and then eventually the the deal did fall through.

 

[3:04:20] But it was because of this video that the business owner wrote directly back to me literally the same day saying, "Hey, I saw your video. Most people don't do something like this." It was just nice to see somebody talking in person and that kind of thing.

 

[3:04:45] So, let me play this for you guys so you can you can see what what the guy actually saw. So, let me stop share here for a second and I'll have to come out of full screen, Donna.

 

[3:05:10] Okay, let's do share computer sound. Oh, look at that. There we are. Everybody see this? Okay, I'll put this in theater mode. Looks like it's not. Let me just refresh. Here we go. All right.

 

[3:05:40] [VIDEO PLAYBACK BEGINS]

 

Hey there, James. You don't know me. I've had some really great convers. Can you guys hear that, by the way? Is it loud and clear?

 

[3:06:05] I can hear it. See in the chat? Yes. Let's let's go from the beginning here. All right. Break your notebooks out. See what you notice about this video. Good, bad, strange, whatever. All right.

 

[3:06:30] [VIDEO CONTINUES]

 

Hey there, James. You don't know me. I've had some really great conversations with Ryan about the great progress CC Salespro has made this year.

 

[3:06:55] My name is Rich Jay and I want to help CC Salespro create even more revenues in the coming years. Now, I wanted to take a moment and say that I've done some research on credit card processing coaches online and that hands down there is no one that is delivering as much value as you are in this market.

 

[3:07:25] So, it's really great to see that positioning you've got as well as the value you're delivering to to all of your customers.

 

[3:07:50] Now, as I think about this, in a previous life, I was in retail restaurants for many years, and we were constantly being pitched by processors and other services that wanted to get our business.

 

[3:08:15] So, James, I know that this market niche is huge, and it's not going away anytime soon. Now, I work with Dan Lockach and closers.com, and we really help companies who have leads already coming in close more deals.

 

[3:08:45] And we do this by plugging your company in with some of our top closers. And just to be clear for this video it's really valuable for anyone in your company to watch. It could be decision makers. Please forward to Ryan by the way.

 

[3:09:15] Any other business partners, salespeople, managers, everyone can get value from this because from what I can see you've got a team who really wants to help you with your goals. Right.

 

[3:09:45] So now we have trained thousands of certified closers now and we've helped plug companies into our team to get more revenue in the door each month.

 

[3:10:15] And some of the ways that we do this are by keeping the minimum KPIs on the closers, helping you get more deals, and we'll swap out anything that's not meeting your requirements. And we're able to do this without bugging you or slowing down your operations.

 

[3:10:45] Is we built out processes that attract that develop and retain only the best closing talent. It's it's really a great systems approach that we've optimized over the years. And again, you don't have to worry about the training either. We handle all of that.

 

[3:11:15] Now, by the way, this doesn't have to be for the six week jumpstart program. It can be for any of your high-value offers for your community, ones that you're offering now and ones that are coming down the pipeline.

 

[3:11:45] Oh, and also we'll continue to add value by providing scripts for follow-up emails and after leads come in to increase the appointment show rates, which will really help us close more deals for you.

 

[3:12:15] And James, one great action, actually, one great action you can take right away if you already have a sales team, and I know Ryan is a pivotal part of that is to stop closing people online through your webinars and sales pages, and to start closing with physical closers.

 

[3:12:45] Why do I say that? Well, when Danlock did this, we went from a mere 8% conversion to 28% of our leads closing, which was massive for our bottom line.

 

[3:13:15] So, long story short, as long as you have leads coming into CC SalesPro and want to close more deals while avoiding the headaches of additional operations time, building out a team of well-trained closers that are accountable, we can help.

 

[3:13:45] Now, our intention for making this video, James, is to get on a call together and help CC Salespro make more revenue with our closers.

 

[3:14:15] So, if you're interested, my cell number and email are in the description of this video. My email is rich the letter J@closers.com and my cell number is 352-815-3866.

 

[3:14:45] Now we don't send these out to just any random company either. We are convicted that this will help your company based off of what we've been able to research online about you, James, and your coaching programs. And we're really excited to help.

 

[3:15:15] So bye for now. We'll talk soon. Thanks for watching this.

 

[3:15:30] [VIDEO ENDS]

 

All right. What'd you guys think? It was okay, right? It's not probably wasn't my top video, but it was one of the earlier I just want to let you see kind of the early stage.

 

[3:15:55] Like if you're working on this like for a long time, maybe giving couple hours a day for three or four weeks. This is probably one stage you could look forward to. You could be much further ahead.

 

[3:16:20] I mean, it's what I want to ask you guys as as ultra high ticket prospectors is, are you comfortable with putting in the effort to get to doing something like this? Are you excited?

 

[3:16:45] Because at the time, I was nervous. I was super nervous about something like this. And then later on, I became more and more excited about it. Okay.

NÚMEROS: 3:50 minutos

 

VISUAL: Elementos de análise: estrutura, fluxo, nervosismo visível

 

[3:17:15] So, let's critique this really quickly just based off of what you know. What did you like about the video? Is that 3 minutes and 50 seconds?

 

[3:17:40] Bden says, "Good structure, detached but warm, communicative in and in flow, not perfectionist, very good approach and genuine excitement." Cool.

 

[3:18:05] Aiden says, "Great progression telling the story here. Starting from some personalized compliments on their product to SL to lightly speaking on the value offering forcloser.com aka the Yi FM.

 

[3:18:30] You're not stopping at something high level though, bringing in concrete data and numbers to show that we've done that homework. You also leverage the video to show and not tell, letting the numbers speak for themselves." Very, very cool.

 

[3:18:55] How many of you could tell that I was in parts of the video I was still kind of scripted and nervous? Chandler says, "Yes, a bit." You could tell, right? They're pieces there. They're not just didn't really flow. A little awkward. Yeah.

 

[3:19:25] So, it's very very real, right? So, the idea is that, you know, you're not perfect. Nobody's perfect at doing this. Some people are a lot better. I think extroverts typically a little bit better at at doing something like this.

 

[3:19:50] And you could certainly, you know, gravitate to to more advanced better performances over a shorter period of time. But over time, if you put in the hours and you're actually doing this through a scripted, structured way, you definitely can get to a level where it seems natural and you're not reading off of a script.

 

[3:20:20] Now, how many of how many of you guys thought I was reading off of a script? See, a lot of nos. Not really.

 

[3:20:45] How many I'm just curious because I never pulled anybody about this, but how many of you thought that in parts of that video I was still trying to search for I was I was trying to reach for some words from the script that I forgot.

 

[3:21:10] Yes, Sean, you're absolutely right. The tabs are my script. I was reaching parts of it. I'm and the reason why I want to tell you guys this is because this is raw. This is real.

 

[3:21:35] As you put together. This is a production. Think of it as like a short movie, right? You don't want to underestimate the amount of hours. Raphael's here on the chat. Raphael also put in a ton of hours as well.

 

[3:22:00] You may get to see some of his videos when we upload those to Kajjabi for you guys as well as maybe some of Adam's. But we put in a ton of hours because this is not a natural activity that we did before. It was very very unnatural in the beginning. Right.

 

[3:22:30] I will tell you that the answer to my question just now is I was absolutely reading off of a script the entire time of the video. Do you believe it? You don't believe it? Then I'll have to tell you the secret of how that works, won't I?

 

[3:22:55] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Video Production Secret"

 

NÚMEROS: Não especificados

 

VISUAL: Diagrama mostrando processo: Video recording → Screen recording → Editing

 

[3:23:00] It's kind of funny. Okay, I I'll reveal some secrets now and then we'll we'll go through the actual script and then you'll see kind of the parts where where it's coming in and out. Okay.

 

[3:23:25] So the first thing is you'll notice and I you guys put up your hand if you notice this is sometimes this the screen was moving but my hands were moving in front of the camera. So who the hell is controlling the mouse? Do you guys see that? Right.

 

[3:23:50] So you guys notice like who's controlling the mouse as I'm speaking. The reality is to make this a production just like Adam said, you have to break it down into parts.

 

[3:24:15] So first thing and we won't go too much into video production. We actually want to talk more about the script and the messaging which is the most important. You guys can always come back and and look at the way that this was designed, but I think the script is important because the mindset behind it drives the actual engagement of the person watching. Okay.

 

[3:24:45] I'll say that again. The mindset behind the script drives the engagement of the person watching. But here is the idea. You record a video separate, okay? Then you do a screen recording to match yourself while you're playing the the video back. Does that make sense now?

 

[3:25:15] But don't do it like me. Don't flail your hands in front of the camera, okay? Because it just kind of looks weird. Okay?

 

[3:25:40] So, you're recording the video with a script. It's going to be in front of the camera, very close to where the camera is on your laptop or on your monitor. So it looks like you're looking into the camera wherever possible. Okay, the script will be there.

 

[3:26:05] And then by the time you finish that, you'll set that aside. Then you get all of your tabs ready. And we have a specific way that we're presenting the script. So we've got the tabs ready from left to right. You can see them up at the top here, right?

 

[3:26:30] We've got the the company. We've got some of the videos from the company. We've got Sefue's pages, his Instagram. Then we go into the this is exactly the pro progression of the script pretty much from left to right. Does that make sense?

 

[3:26:55] Let me take a second here. How much how did Rich move the video without his hands? Jonathan Franks. Yeah. So that's that's the secret behind behind that is to keep it separate.

 

[3:27:20] And I will I will confirm with Adam that it probably took me an hour to two hours of research before even lining up things for the video. I would do the research because without the research, can you write the script? Not really. Right?

 

[3:27:45] Without the research, do you know which parts of the website to go to? No, not really. Right? Without the research, do you know where to put specific mentions of people and you know who you know and things like that? You you won't.

 

[3:28:10] So you have to do the research first then then you go into the script second piece and then you go into recording and then you do your editing afterwards. Okay.

 

[3:28:35] So I put about in the beginning it was like two hours of research figure out what I wanted to say then it would for recording may take like 30 45 minutes to record the actual video plus the screen recording just to get it right the timings right.

 

[3:29:00] And then I would use a piece of software. There's tons of software out there that does this, but the one I used was Camtasia. Some of you guys that may have used Camtasia, but you can use any kind of simple video video editing software.

 

[3:29:30] And you'll see you guys remember where the boxes were going left and right. What why was it important that I moved my move my little video from left to right, up and down? See if you guys paid attention to that.

 

[3:29:55] Not to block things. Yeah, that's right, Joel. I don't want to block what I'm talking about. This is key, guys. When you get to making your videos, you need to move the the box at least once every, I don't know, 45 seconds to a minute at least because it gets too boring. Okay.

 

[3:30:25] There's if there's nothing flying around on the screen, like people will end up closing it. It's just not it's not as engaging. So, you're absolutely right about engagement, Muhammad. And you can do that with Cam Camtasia. It's very easy.

 

[3:30:50] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Anatomy of Video Prospecting Message"

 

NÚMEROS: 7 componentes principais

 

VISUAL: Estrutura numerada: 1. Intro/Pattern Interrupt, 2. Purpose Statement, 3. Rapport Building, etc.

 

[3:30:55] All right, let's fly back to the slides real quick and let's go over what's happening here. And let me see if I can go. Let's go full screen. Can you guys see my screen? Yes. All good.

 

[3:31:20] All right. So, let's talk about anatomy of what's going on in there. And some of you actually, I forget who it was that just listed the bullet points of all the different pieces of the message. Thank you. That was very very you guys go back and scroll up and take a look at that.

 

[3:31:50] That was very very pretty much exactly what I'm saying here. So first we start out with an intro and there somebody had mentioned that I had a pattern interrupt when I did that. Yes, there is a bit of a pattern interrupt and you have to, right?

 

[3:32:15] Otherwise, if you if what you're saying you're not interrupting, then high likelihood of them just clicking out, right?

 

[3:32:40] The second thing I did was I stated my purpose upfront. How many of you guys remember I I I said why I was contacting them? And then there was was there a rapport built in the very beginning? Some some rapport, right?

 

[3:33:05] And how we're going to refer back to the original part one from two weeks ago. What did I do to pull in rapport with this business owner? Not just the research. Daniel got it mentioned. Oh, so Diego's taking notes. Mentioned Ryan.

 

[3:33:30] Ryan is Ryan is the top sales guy. So immediately within the first 30 seconds, you can see that I used Ryan's name. Okay?

 

[3:33:55] So as soon as let's say if I I sent a video message to you guys and I said, "Hey, so and so told me about you guys. I love what you're doing. I was talking to so-and so the other day."

 

[3:34:20] And like if I if I start talking to you like that, immediately that relationship builds a connection. So if you have one of those, sometimes we don't, but if you have one of those, use it. Don't waste it, right? Don't waste it.

 

[3:34:45] Third is very high level. Like how do we do what we do? Right? We're closers.com. How do we do what we do? How do we how do we have top 1%? Like how are we able to keep those people? Right?

 

[3:35:10] We had the whole closing ratio spreadsheet if you guys remember, right? And also casually mention, hey, I'm talking to you, but actually this message could be for anybody in your group. Send it on to Ryan. Send it on to your your delivery people, whoever you want, right?

 

[3:35:40] Because everybody in your company should be excited about what we're about to tell you. You see the mindset there? I'm so excited. I'm I'm professionally from a tone perspective professionally excited about my message, but I want everybody in your company to hear about it because it's going to elevate your company 100% thousand%. That's my conviction.

 

[3:36:10] Your dog, your cat, your children, the janitor. Absolutely. Because everybody on your team wants your company to succeed, right? So I had to mention that.

 

[3:36:35] So this remember this is one framework to do and it's it's gotten a lot of results. I would say at a clip this type of a video even when Jeremy was using it would get up to 20 to 25% conversion on just setting up an appointment. One out of four. Okay.

 

[3:37:05] So, if you had a list of 16 leads and you did the research and you recorded these videos, would you be happy if four of them came back to you excited and wanted to talk to you?

 

[3:37:30] Yeah, absolutely. Geez, if they're on my ultra 100 list and then if I could get them to respond to me and say, "Hey, that was a cool video. Can can you tell me more? Heck yeah. I'm going to put in that extra two or three hours because otherwise, look at the alternative, guys. Right?

 

[3:37:55] What's the alternative? We go back to email, send a LinkedIn message, right? Wait for the next availability to make a phone call outbound.

 

[3:38:20] This is cutting edge stuff because you're no longer doing what 99% of the people are doing out there. 99.9. Like, who spends the time to put together a video like that? Are you crazy? Right?

 

[3:38:45] And so most of the time a a common reaction is if somebody is yelling my name in a video and I happen to open up that video, I'm going to be like, first of all, I'm going to be surprised.

 

[3:39:10] And number two, even if I don't respond, I will remember who that person is cuz holy this guy Rich was talking about closing. He sent me a video. You can always go back to that, right? Okay.

 

[3:39:35] Bogdan's got a good message before we go through the rest of the anatomy here. How do you make them watch it? Okay, let me hold off on that because we got a some notes on how to do that at the very end here. Is that okay, Bogdan? Okay.

 

[3:40:00] We're going to do who's this message for? We just talked about that's for everybody. Deep dive with some really nice visuals. Any kind of objection that you have for your company that you can think of.

 

[3:40:30] If it's price, if it's location, if it's, you know, service level, whatever it may be, address those upfront because if you're doing a sales pitch, the last thing you want to do is to have your sale your prospect walk away still fearing, still allowing the fear to overtake their action, their ability to take action, right?

 

[3:41:00] So go ahead and object those things that they're afraid of right there. Okay. So can anybody name one objection that I and Raphael and Adam would be addressing or what you saw in the video? What do we address address in terms of objections?

 

[3:41:30] The possible objection you did it very casually in a way where you said hey if we if somebody's not performing at the usual rate we can swap them out because most people ask okay what is if somebody doesn't do what he's supposed to do. Yeah that's one awesome thank you Adam what else who else noticed.

 

[3:42:00] Low performing closers that was it Aaron matching okay good Bobby by Oh, Shan says, "I object achieved or addressed a objection of is this company legit. Training time. Yep. Kelly, you got it." Yeah.

 

[3:42:30] So, so these are the things that we got to address up up front because you only have the three minutes in there or four minutes if you want to make a four or five minute video. Like you only have those few minutes, you might as well tell them, hey, you know what? Don't worry about it. We got you covered.

 

[3:43:00] And we we see this all the time. We know that you might be concerned about this, but you know what? It's not even an issue for us because of this. Okay.

 

[3:43:30] Number seven, and finally, recap. State your intention. Why are you so exc why have you brought this message to me? Why are you so excited about this? I need to know as the recipient like what do you what do you want? You want me to book a call with the excitement that you just provided? Like what do you want me to do? What's the intention? Okay, state that at the end.

 

[3:44:00] Yep, there's some qualification going on in there. All right. How many of you guys would be okay with if we just stepped through a similar script and a similar framework sentence by sentence to show you what the psychology of that you just watched? You guys okay with that? You guys you guys got time for that?

 

[3:44:30] I don't know. These guys look kind of excited. Okay, let's let's do that. All right, let's let's go into the formula.

 

[3:44:55] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Video Script Formula - Copywriters Version"

 

NÚMEROS: Script completo linha por linha

 

VISUAL: Script formatado com anotações de timing, ênfases, elementos visuais

 

[3:45:00] All right. So, you guys will get a copy of this in Kajjabi. Take notes if you want to start using it tomorrow if you want to, today if you want to. But here's a here's another version that's written for copywriters, not closers.

 

[3:45:30] And I'll take you through. It's the same exact mindset and it's also the same exact structure. Okay.

 

[3:45:55] So, the first thing is we start off on their website or one of their other pages, social media. Why? Why do we do that? Why do we start out on their website, not on our website? Somebody tell me.

 

[3:46:20] Yes, it is about them. Yes, it's personal. Yeah. No, no, nobody cares who the we are. Who said that? Daniel. Nobody cares. Like you you're just another freaking video showing off your stuff. Like it's not about you, it's about them. Right.

 

[3:46:50] Chia actually Chia says it's about them. Diego said exactly. How do you get them to open? Well, you got to show them something they recognize. They don't recognize you at all.

 

[3:47:15] Then you say you start out by addressing one of the biggest objections, which is I don't know who the you are. Right? So, you just say that, "Hey, you don't know me. I don't know you. You don't know me. Okay? Here's my name. And here's what I want to do right there out of the gate."

 

[3:47:45] How long does it take to state and overcome that objection of of somebody who's unfamiliar and to state the the actual intention there. It's literally seconds. Seconds.

 

[3:48:10] And remember who we're dealing with here. We're talking B2B. We're not talking B TOC anymore. What type of what gem type are we typically dealing with on a B2B level? This is stereotypical obviously, but yeah, a little bit more ruby, a little bit more impatience, like get to the point, right?

 

[3:48:40] So, we want to open and be quick about you don't know me, my name's Rich. I want to help your company just make more money. Like, that's all I want to do. That I'm straight up. That's what I'm going to do. Okay.

 

[3:49:05] So, you get that out of the way. You kind of cater to the Ruby side. They're just wondering what what the hell are you doing on their website, right? So, you answer that and then you expand.

 

[3:49:30] Point number four, we're going to address that. This is how we actually do it. Okay. We start out. I work with Dan. We help companies just like yours create more revenue, right, with copywriters.com in this case.

 

[3:49:55] And we do it. How do we do it? We do it by plugging your company in with our copywriting network and we show, excuse me, we show the visual for that and we show the validation if it's a maybe just a glimpse of a testimonial or a glimpse of parts of the the inner workings, right? That's how we plug plug them in.

 

[3:50:25] All right, we talked about remember we talked about who the message is for, guys. To be clear, this video is valuable for anyone in the company to watch. You know, decision makers just like yourself, executives, marketers, the managers, everyone can get value from this video because from what we understand, you got a great team and everybody wants to be a part of this team's success, right?

 

[3:50:55] So, does this mean that this video is exciting to the person who's trying to deliver it, or it's something that's just like bottled up just for the CEO, bottled up just for the for the business owner? It's exciting. Jesus, I want everybody to know. Yeah. Tell everybody. This is great stuff. Tell everybody. This is for everybody, right? And you get that out.

 

[3:51:25] Another thing I got to mention is you have to have conviction. How many of you guys here have actually are actually good at brainwashing yourself right before you have to deliver a message?

 

[3:51:50] I won't say brain. Maybe I should use Adam. Should I say hypnotize yourself? Self self hypnosis. Oh yeah, that works very well. I I I'm starting to get good at that. Yeah, because you got to be in the zone, right? Sometimes we call it the zone.

 

[3:52:20] And when you deliver that message, you have to have the most authentic conviction. Those are two key words. I want you to write that down because au authentic and then conviction has to be there. It's got to be true.

 

[3:52:45] You have to you have to believe it at your core and you have to show that you you're true to this, right? You're true to this message. You're not just saying it to be a salesperson. You're not just saying saying it to make the sale.

 

[3:53:10] And by the way, can they tell if you're not 100 or 1,000% confident in your message? Can they tell? Oh, yeah. They can tell right away. Even my last message, there are parts in there just kind of a little nervous, right? No conviction in those points.

 

[3:53:40] So you have to be 100% convicted as we like to say convicted like a criminal and you have to you have to believe in your message 100%. I cannot say that enough because what happened in the very beginning I don't know if Adam you got the the feedback but we used to post into telegram our draft videos.

 

[3:54:10] Raphael can attest to this actually. I remember Raphael and I would would post our our videos and then Jeremy would come back in the chat group. You know what Jeremy would say?

 

[3:54:35] Oh yeah. I was like, "Yeah, this is not good. This is not good." Like this sounds robotic. This sounds unscripted. He was you sound like you you would spent just imagine this guys, okay? You just spent freaking five hours of your time researching doing a 100 takes of the video message, doing a 100 takes of the screen the screen share, right?

 

[3:55:05] And you post it in Telegram and then the your coach, right? In this case, it's Jeremy, he comes back, he's like, "It sucks." Yeah. I need to think like, "What did I do the last 100 hours?"

 

[3:55:30] Raphael says, "Laughable." It's like it's like okay and this is why when you're going through a process of learning don't wait until the final stage to get feedback right we talk about if you guys ever get a chance to go out to YouTube or some of these these places that train for leadership there's a really fun exercise called the marsh I think it's called the marshm marshmallow challenge.

 

[3:56:00] And it's basically a a game that they put executives through to prototype to learn about the benefits of prototyping. The same thing goes for this video process is if you're just starting out, hey, make a draft video and get somebody to take a look at it, right? You need that feedback.

 

[3:56:30] Don't don't try to perfect it on one go. Make half of it and say, "Hey, Adam, what do you think? Been working on this for a little while, but what do you think? It's not the whole thing, but what do you think?" Right? That's called prototyping.

 

[3:56:55] Doesn't have to be perfect in the beginning, but you need that feedback. And boy did we get our share of feedback, right, Raph? Yeah. So.

 

[3:57:20] Second part is what we're going to transition to show them exactly how this is going to work, but more importantly, the how. We talked this talk about this at closing. Nobody cares about the how. Really, what they care about is the outcome. Sometimes we call benefits, but what's the outcome? Okay.

 

[3:57:50] Visuals are important. Everything that you're saying should be animated and paired with those visuals, right? And then there's in in many cases when you structure your own formula, you want to include the social proof, which is testimonials.

 

[3:58:15] In this case, we say, "Hey, we've trained thousands of certified people and we plug them straight into the company. The companies are getting more revenue in the door each month." We got the proof here. You show the testimonial page and they're like, "Oh that's that's a lot of testimonials." Right?

 

[3:58:40] In the back of their mind, they're saying, "Shit, that's a lot of testimonials." All right, here we go. Now, this is part of the part of the how. Again, we say, "Hey, some of the ways we do this are by leveraging our copyriters or closers to do this for all the channels, all the landing pages."

 

[3:59:10] In the case of closers would be doing it for closing those deals, right? In copywriters, it's for landing pages, emails, chat bots, and organic organic copy.

 

[3:59:35] We also say another benefit here in this case, it's taking the load off of your current marketing team, right? Which means a marketing team instead of doing all this writing, they can free up their time focus more on revenue driven activities because that copy usually takes a long time. But we do it really well.

 

[4:00:05] So we're saying it takes a long time so the marketers can actually get back their attention, focus on the important stuff, right? So again another bullet on benefits.

 

[4:00:30] And then the second to last bullet here, we are able to do this without bugging you or slowing down your operations. Okay, what am I addressing there? An objection, right?

 

[4:00:55] So, one objection from these business owners like if I work with you guys, you guys are just going to keep asking me questions and I still won't be able to get my done because you're external. Right. You're just going to slow me down because you're external. That is a that is a valid concern. Agree? Okay.

 

[4:01:25] And then the last bullet again, training is an objection we we also address as well. Here's the last last third of it. So I go in and I say, and this is for copyriters.

 

[4:01:50] So, our copywriters are focused on your marketing goals, and we're really skilled at converting at a high opt-in and high closing rates with everything that we're trained to do.

 

[4:02:15] So, long story short, and you'll hear, if you guys have ever worked with Jeremy, that's his big phrase. Long story short, long story short, this is for the rubies. Long story short, as long as you need highly skilled and accountable copywriters to help your marketing team with driving revenue, we're here to help. Okay.

 

[4:02:45] And then finally, you end with intention. Our intention of making this video is to get on a call together, help your company make more revenue with our copywriters. So, if you're interested, here's my contact information down below.

 

[4:03:10] And then we cap it off by making it sound exclusive just like somebody mentioned earlier, right? We're not sending this. This is not a mass mail out. This is definitely not a mass mail out, right?

 

[4:03:35] So, we don't send this to just any random company. Again, we're convicted that this will help you based on what we've been able to research and we're super excited about this opportunity. So, talk to you soon. Thanks for listening.

 

[4:04:00] What do you guys think? Is that is that pretty decent framework for a video? I think it's pretty good. It's pretty good. Now you guys understand some of the mindset behind this.

 

[4:04:30] So I just went through the entire script. This is a four-minute script. Okay, pretty much everything's built in here. You can you can copy and paste it. I would recommend that you do not use it word for word.

 

[4:04:55] When you guys are able to download this and and study it some more, I would I would definitely recommend you can follow a general framework, but the wording of it has to be in your voice. Okay?

 

[4:05:20] Because you have to again authentic conviction, authentic confident confidence in the message, right? If if you're speaking like Jeremy, it just may not come out right. I think Raphael knows knows what I'm talking about for that. I certainly know.

 

[4:05:45] So, you'll see I wrote this. Those of you who are in high income high income copywriter writing this over and over again, you realize, hey, this is not the way I talk. I don't talk that way. Right.

 

[4:06:10] So, even as I'm reading the bullets out to you guys, you can see I I change it up. It's more my my style, my cadence. Yeah. Adam says, "Try to say it as if you would explain it to your best buddy." Absolutely. Yeah.

 

[4:06:35] And again, you'll be surprised your first run through this, even if you do a script reading with no video, just audio, you'll be able to hear the amount of conviction. You'll be able to hear the amount of authentic, caring side, like I care about your company. Like, you'll be able to hear that kind of thing going on in your voice.

 

[4:07:05] And if you can't hear it, or if you think you can hear it, but you're not sure, what should you do? Adam says he sounded like a voice assistant. Yeah, get feedback. Prototype it.

 

[4:07:30] Don't build the entire video and think that, holy I'd finished one project and now I can finally present it to somebody for feedback. Like that might be too late is that's all I'm saying. It just might be too late.

 

[4:07:55] So you want to do it maybe in pieces. Work with a team member. Work with somebody you can hold accountable to somebody here in UHTC. You can, you know, try it together, right?

 

[4:08:20] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Channel Strategy: Blanket Approach"

 

NÚMEROS: Múltiplos canais simultaneamente

 

VISUAL: Lista de canais: LinkedIn, Email, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Phone

 

[4:08:25] All right. Note on channels bogden. You asked about this. This is the cardinal rule for getting responses. Don't just send it to LinkedIn. Send it to all the channels. Send it to all the channels.

 

[4:08:50] And why is that so important? Is everybody a LinkedIn user yet? No. Yes. Well, maybe in some cases I'm just I'm catching up with the I've got a delay here.

 

[4:09:15] But people people use different channels of communication during different times and also with different frequencies. So let's suppose that you send something people a lot of people are on are on Facebook, but let's say you know you have an executive or you have a business owner that literally doesn't check Facebook until the weekend and you just finished your video on Monday.

 

[4:09:45] What does that mean about your video? You got to wait until the weekend before he sees it. Right. It's too late. That's right. For every freaking two-hour hour, every freaking hour is time that you could have started that dialogue.

 

[4:10:10] So, your your ideal situation is you use all of these. We call it the blanket approach. You guys are saying the net is perfect. The the the cut and paste where you're you're you're posting at multiple social networks so you get the widest reach.

 

[4:10:40] And you're doing that because you don't want to leave one stone unturned. That is what a high ultra high ticket closer does. You're not going to leave one stone unturned. You don't have time.

 

[4:11:05] You just you you you got big goals to reach. Why why would you you just created a a video with five hours of your precious time? Like why would you just only send it via email, right? It makes no sense.

 

[4:11:30] So sometimes we'll DM them, right? We'll we'll let them know, hey, I just been following you for for quite some time. I don't know if you know this, but I just sent you something.

 

[4:11:55] And then you could you could post it there on the on the message or you could actually have it as a separate email as well. Me check the chat here. We got any good questions here coming in comments.

 

[4:12:20] Dana, I was still muted. There's a question from Renu. Should we not send on one platform before sending on another one to avoid coming across as spammy just in case prospect ends up checking our message on more than one platform?

 

[4:12:45] I love that question. That's a good question. What do you guys think? Grant, my man. Omnireents. Yeah. Yeah. Still need to do it. Mhm.

 

[4:13:10] Yeah. So, think about it this way. If if let's let's let's turn it around. Okay. Right now, we're talking about sales. We're talking about offering somebody that will help them. Offer offering a company a solution, right? That's what we're talking about here.

 

[4:13:40] But imagine you had something so important that it was life or death situation and you had to you had to get a hold of this person to let them know. That's what we're talking about here.

 

[4:14:05] This is such a you are so confident that if they don't take action on this within the next day that their their business would just be missing out big time. Like that's how convicted you are.

 

[4:14:30] And that because you have that conviction and also because you have the hunger, right, and the optimism that he's going to open it, you're going to actually do it for all those channels because it was that important.

 

[4:14:55] I wouldn't I wouldn't say I mean you could say, "Oh, you're spamming them." Yeah, I mean that's that's one way to look at it, but the other way to look at it is I've got something important. I need him to he him or her to actually be able to read it in time. Otherwise, they're going to, you know, they're going to they're going to fail, right? It's that important.

 

[4:15:25] Every single video that you produce is you should believe and you should have the conviction and self-hypnosis. Whatever it is, you need to believe that it's that important that they get it. That's the way I feel.

 

[4:15:50] Okay, here was another question from Christian. Can you talk about the psychology of actually caring? How do you get there? I care about my income. I care about people as individuals, but there are so many companies out there. Caring about someone else's business or passion is a stretch for me.

 

[4:16:20] Who is that from? This is from Christian. Christian. Okay. Can I chime in on that? Yeah. Yeah. Adam, go ahead. I'm just reading through the message again.

 

[4:16:45] Thank you. So, Christian respecting that. I put it in chat too but if you if that the way you asked those questions that said season shows that you are thinking about yourself here the psychology of caring is completely detached from you.

 

[4:17:10] If you care about your income that's great but caring about someone else doesn't have to do with your own preferences. Yes you will do the same script the same video a 100 times but it's not about the script.

 

[4:17:35] This is just a method, the tool to convey the idea. It doesn't matter like you would you say the same if you have a 100 prospect calls, do you not care about them anymore after a while? Every person is different.

 

[4:18:00] And so therefore, it is very important to analyze and understand the core. Every business owner created their company and their business out of love, out of a of a drive. They sacrificed time. They sacrificed loved ones. They sacrificed money and effort, blood, sweat and tears.

 

[4:18:30] They have been sitting on the floor crying because nothing worked out. They were confused. They were desperate. And then they created something and it finally grew.

 

[4:18:55] And you are the one going there being able to give them the next step they didn't even know they could use. Remember what happens when you are the one person that reaches out and help them with the service to grow their company to such immense measurements that they think back 10, 20, 30 years in the in the future.

 

[4:19:25] They think back and say, "Damn, because that Christian guy reached out to me and helped me. My company is that multi-million dollar empire now. It was a small business before.

 

[4:19:50] Imagine they get interviewed. They became a billionaire with this maybe and they get interviewed. What happened? And he like well 30 years ago. That one guy was so persistent and I felt he was caring.

 

[4:20:15] At first I ignored him at the company. I was like why did I send him a video? But he was persistent in a in a non-salesy way. He was like not sleazy. Never saw that before. And I I listened to him. He convinced me and boom my company just grew.

 

[4:20:45] Don't you want to be a part of that? And now imagine if this happens multiple times. Imagine if that happens a 100 times a day. Imagine when that happens every day.

 

[4:21:10] And then imagine speaking with that people. You are part of the sales team. Imagine that person becomes part of our community. So you're not talking to a prospect. You're not talking to a business owner. You're talking to a future brother, a future sister.

 

[4:21:40] You're talking to a company, a multi-million, even a billion dollar company in the making. And therefore, I want you to call them as if you would be a travel time traveler from the future.

 

[4:22:05] You know that per like that company is already a multi-million dollar company and you know you were the one who helped them and you traveled back in time to this specific point because you know this is the part where you change history of mankind because you have even more impact than that.

 

[4:22:35] Imagine when the company grows to a multi-million dollar company how many jobs get created how many lives get saved. Now in corona times we have the problem that people are losing their jobs.

 

[4:23:00] If you help them grow people keep their jobs, families get saved, children get saved, futures get saved. Imagine what kind of impact you have there. And now ask again how you care about people. Think about purpose and you will ignite a passion beyond belief.

 

[4:23:30] Amazing. It's a very very powerful message there there. Adam, thank you. My pleasure. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.

 

[4:23:55] One other thing too if if I might add is is to address kind of the objection that's inherent in that message, Christian, which is which I think and this is my interpretation is that 1 plus 1 always equals two, which which I don't I don't my my personal belief is I don't believe 1 plus 1 always equals two.

 

[4:24:25] I think that one plus one sometimes can equal so much more which means to me that means like yes I care about my family. I care about individuals around me but my my love and my care is not bound by time.

 

[4:24:50] There are ways and this is again I think this goes back to our psychology as closers as ultra high ticket closers too is we're not thinking in terms of one plus 1 anymore we're thinking in terms of 1 times 5 1 times 10 right.

 

[4:25:20] So so yeah there are limited hours in a day but because we have the ability to develop this this this power we'll call it skill and power for now we have that ability the 24 hours that we have actually becomes multiplied and it's not multiplied instantly but over time.

 

[4:25:50] You'll find that hey and you know Steven CVY talks about it in his in his book you guys may recognize that name but the seven habits is your circle of influence you guys remember that circle of influence starts out small right I can only help the people around me today that's okay, that's perfectly okay.

 

[4:26:20] But as you grow in influence and power and the things that you are able to exert influence and control over, that circle gets bigger. You won't even realize it, but you'll already start impacting the neighborhood right outside your house. You'll start impacting the city, the companies in your neighborhood.

 

[4:26:50] Yeah, there's a ripple effect. Thank Thank you for sharing that Adam and also thank you Christian for bringing bringing that to our attention which I think is a common is a common mindset and it's also something that we have to be extremely aware of is is the the the where do we see the limits of our abilities? Okay.

 

[4:27:20] Just scanning through questions here. Donna, if yes, there was another question from Michael Rich. I may have missed this in your slides. However, I remember one specific thing that Jeremy teaches is to give them a piece of value in the video. Give them some small thing they could implement right away. Is this covered here?

 

[4:27:50] It's not covered today. It is covered. Well, I I should say it is a general principle that we we tend to utilize and and if you look back to I guess right now the the video script and also the anatomy right now is more focused on bringing news to light.

 

[4:28:20] It's almost like oh I have I have good news. I've spoken to somebody you know in your company already and you know this this is something I really want to help you with right if you want to find out more than than contact.

 

[4:28:45] So it is not an internal is not a initial value ad but certainly there is we have had modifications I've seen Raphael do it too Adam probably does it is you you can also attach stuff to that.

 

[4:29:10] So I think you could say I've included some some email templates that are crafted just for your company in these situations. I want you to go ahead and take a look at those. If they can help your sales team go ahead and use those. Right. And there there's an example of your value ad.

 

[4:29:40] It's so powerful and it's such a great question too because Sefue by nature of of having, you know, his business experience, some of the very early successes were based off of free work, right? Let me go ahead and rewrite your entire website landing page, give it to you for free, and then all of a sudden he has the business of the entire agency, right?

 

[4:30:10] These are the types of things like yes it is is part of what Jeremy taught us but it's not covered in this presentation but it should be part of your mindset which is always try to offer something of value first. So good good question.

 

[4:30:35] Here's another question from Garrett. How deeply do you research their personal life and how do you integrate it into the video message?

 

[4:31:00] That's a good question. Why don't we let's unmute and and see if we can elaborate on that question. We'll hear from him directly. Okay, that's okay. Garrett has his hand up. You can unmute yourself. Garrett, hello.

 

[4:31:30] Hey, Garrett. How are you? I'm doing well. How are you doing? Great. Enjoying enjoying the lessons. So when you're doing your research, obviously you're doing a lot of research on the company, but you address this to a particular person and are you looking towards their gem type as well when you're doing this?

 

[4:32:00] You you have to know something about them as an individual when you're doing that, I'm assuming. So that's a great it's a great question. Again, this is something that that Adam and I have explored as well.

 

[4:32:30] There's there's tool there are tools out there and even if you don't use those tools you can pretty much take a look at somebody's resume and start over time you'll be able to guess kind of the the gem make some assumptions obviously but you can essentially slot them into different categories for sure.

 

[4:33:00] To give you an example you'll have VPs and CEOs with engineering background so what does that tell you about the person? Emerald. A little bit more emerald a little bit more detail oriented they may come back with you, you know, faster on questions revolving around quantities and price and things like that, right?

 

[4:33:30] So, so we can make those assumptions. They're def they're definitely not they're broad assumptions, right? So, it just it just it just depends. We we do that I think naturally, right? Even after coming out of HTC, we start stereotyping people based off of just tiny little cues. For sure.

 

[4:34:00] Yeah. So, is that a focus of your research though as you're preparing to address them?

 

[4:34:20] Yes, it is. So, the tool that I was going to refer to, Adam, do you remember the tool that's I think it started with Crystal? It's a LinkedIn tool. It's so damn powerful. It's good. It's really I use it for everybody that I research. It's just so good.

 

[4:34:50] Yeah. So, the the tool's name is Crystal Nose. There's a bunch of other ones out there, I'm sure, that do similar things, but when you have that tool, then of course you can craft the message a little bit better from a scripting perspective, right? So, it definitely helps for sure.

 

[4:35:20] So, what kind of tool is that?

 

[4:35:30] It is it is a tool that essentially analyzes résumés or resume like information online. And also, you know, I I don't know how deep it gets into postings and things like that on LinkedIn, but it'll summarize what type of person that that that person is based off of that information.

 

[4:36:00] Interesting. Okay. Thank you.

 

[4:36:10] Can even it can even analyze messages. You can encrypt that in. And I tested it a little bit. It also researches your connections. I tested it because my fianceé Lisa she had a LinkedIn profile but no posts and aboutund like about a few connections that had a lot of connections themselves.

 

[4:36:40] And it gave a perfect like a really to the tea perfect analysis of her personality despite her having no content on her profile and only 19 connections.

 

[4:37:05] So therefore you can use it for many things and also it's very useful some influencers have people that write for them. Now, here's the thing. You can copy text and put it into crystal nodes and then it will tell you the personality type.

 

[4:37:30] So, when you use different text on the website and some you know for a fact something they posted themselves, you put it in and you see this a different personality type then you know they have a writer for them which is extremely useful for you to know if you want to close for copyrighters for example or you want to understand who you are writing for.

 

[4:38:00] Because if all the posts of one profile fit one personality type, you know exactly, okay, there's somebody else that writes it and you want to engage that person and build a relationship to them because they probably have a lot of influence there. So that's my tactic for this.

 

[4:38:30] Thank you, Adam. I I appreciate that because I mean if if not everybody's going to subscribe to these, so you you just need to get in the habit of looking up some of these cues.

 

[4:38:55] I like what the Sarge is actually commenting here in the chat for for some of the questions which is really good. The Sarge says he actually comes in to some of these engagements. Even this the script writing he may start out neutral but as soon as he finds out some additional information additional information comes into the call for example he'll switch immediately to accommodate some of the tonalities and things like that if it's a live call.

 

[4:39:25] But yeah, of course the broad assumptions have to be made based off of resumes. I would I would definitely look at kind of the background. I think it's natural for for those of you guys who aren't who don't have the habit of linked like LinkedIn what do we call it stalking I I hate to use the word stalking.

 

[4:39:55] But usually before I get onto a call with any you know we're in the process of looking at vendors for example every time I get before I get on a call always always doing the research on LinkedIn looking at somebody's resume where they from where do they live what what was their education were they you know engineer they you know a lawyer whatever they maybe.

 

[4:40:25] As a default Sarge is scarier than Crystal knows. Godfred, I would have to agree with you. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.

 

[4:40:50] So, Sarge is Sarge definitely has one of the very rare personalities that is extremely aware and and sensitive to personality types and and scenarios and situations where he is like he's almost got a Sarge, would you say you have like a spider sense? Spidey sense. Oh, what do they call that? Spidey tingle.

 

[4:41:20] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Subject Line Best Practices"

 

NÚMEROS: Não especificados

 

VISUAL: Exemplos de subject lines: lowercase, casual, com nome do prospect

 

[4:41:25] Yeah, let me move on here. I just want to quick mention of subject lines too as you guys are reaching out to people. Jeremy has said that some of this like lowercase less formal you know we think about when we write copy every every we do what it call a capital case where every word is capitalized.

 

[4:41:55] Way in the case of the subject line what Jeremy has seen and what we've seen as well is if we keep it very very general and not capitalized almost casual it's almost like a friend wrote to you without putting too much thought into it you get a higher open rate just from doing that.

 

[4:42:25] So, for example, following up would be the subject line or made this for you, right? So and even the third one he's Jeremy is telling that I personally haven't used it, but using their name in the subject line plus whatever the compelling copy is behind that also can be very effective. It has to be tested though overall.

 

[4:42:55] So, you guys still have to do your testing for sure. Yeah.

 

[4:43:10] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Magnify the Effect"

 

NÚMEROS: Não especificados

 

VISUAL: Estratégias de amplificação: Ultra 100 + Kingpin + Team Specialization

 

[4:43:15] All right. So, what can we do to magnify the effect, guys? Well, in the case since we're we're thinking ultra, we don't do this in isolation. We don't do it kind of in the traditional sense of video prospecting. We think of it in the ultra sense, which means you start magnifying the effect by doing other things with it.

 

[4:43:45] So, for example, you can combine, we talked about having an ultra 100 list before, right? So, when you think about creating that list of partners, could you use video prospecting to help build the bridge with people that you potentially want to work with?

 

[4:44:10] Yeah, why not apply it? You just you just this works powerfully if you go one-on-one just to a just to a list, right? Just to break through that barrier to build that relationship through video. Why not apply this to your list that you just built your ultra 100 list, right?

 

[4:44:40] The script might sound a little bit different because you're talking about partners, developing relationships, joint ventures, things like that for longer term closing, but you need to combine these two to magnify the effect.

 

[4:45:05] And then do what Adam did with his team, which is you got to it's almost like a factory now. You you you're building out. So don't work as a lone wolf. Think about the team. Who else can you work with in that company or in in in the team in the sales team to do this as split it split it up.

 

[4:45:35] As who whoever is good at this? Let's do this part. Whoever's good at that, let's have them do that part. We'll do it very quickly together. Put it assemble it and then send it out to these people. Right? Then you get the efficiency of scale and specialization. Does that make sense?

 

[4:46:00] It's just a simple concept of combining what we talked about today. All right. Okay. This is kind of the last comment. I know we went through this. You guys as long as you are promising that you're not going to distribute any of the actual scripts or any of the videos outside of our class here and outside of our community here.

 

[4:46:30] We're going to send you definitely the copy of this this script as well as some of the actual videos that we've used to prospect. So that's going to be I mean probably helpful to some degree, right? Wouldn't you say?

 

[4:46:55] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Org Charts & Stakeholder Mapping"

 

NÚMEROS: Empresas <50, 50-100, >100 funcionários

 

VISUAL: Organograma hierárquico, diferentes níveis de stakeholders

 

[4:47:00] Now org charts. If you guys aren't from a corporate environment, you're trying to break in as a salesperson into to do these deals, you're going to have to study like org charts a little bit. Okay.

 

[4:47:30] Many of us come from kind of small business or entrepreneurial backgrounds. We haven't been exposed to kind of the larger organizations. These are so important and this is not even an org chart here. It's just to give you an idea that there is a hierarchy in larger organizations where you have to find the right stakeholder otherwise you're you just not going to close. You're not even going to get close. Right?

 

[4:48:00] So what that means is leverage LinkedIn. When you go to a company profile, some of the one of the first things I do is I go take a look how many employees, right? First I slot it into size of company.

 

[4:48:30] Companies that are less than say 50 employees I treat one way. Companies that are less than let's say 50 to 100 I treat slightly differently. I look for different stakeholders. And then companies that are much larger, I look for maybe even more sta, you know, I go for a different approach for those as well.

 

[4:49:00] The idea though is to remember since we're going after bigger deals, what does that tell us about usually u because we talked about cycle time, right? Deal cy the average deal cycle is much longer.

 

[4:49:30] Can you guys tell me for example why the why the deals take so so long to close? Give me a couple reasons. We got more decision makers. Yes. More research for sure. Chain of command. Some hierarchy there. Yep. Sonia. Sonia. There we go.

 

[4:50:00] Chandler hit it. So, one of the ones that we don't think about typically is budget planning cycle. Okay. We got a lot of companies when they do a budget planning cycle, it happens at a certain part of the year.

 

[4:50:30] If you can't catch them after they've allocated or before they've allocated all their budget, what happens? No deal. Or you just got to wait and get in line with the rest of the people for the next planning process. Right?

 

[4:51:00] So in in addition to the org chart, you got to understand who is actually influencing the budget, is it truly the CFO who's making the calls or is it one of the VPs, right? Or if it's somebody who's below the VP who talks in who actually is has the ear of the VP, right?

 

[4:51:30] You see how this is almost like a little bit a game of politics. I like to say it's like who knows who who's in control of what who has the say and it's not always the person at the top that's the most important and the person who needs to be engaged all the time.

 

[4:52:00] Sometimes you have to work it from different angles. Today it could be the VP. If you can't crack the nut on the VP, maybe you're going across to to somebody else who knows the VP in the same organization. Maybe you know the VP's wife or the husband, right?

 

[4:52:30] So, you have to think about it from a political standpoint. There's a structure there and then also the hierarchy like who's making the budget decisions at the end of the day. And we don't talk about that much, but from a ultra high ticket closing perspective, study the org chart to the best of your ability so that you can figure out who are the actual people that need to be listed on your ultra 100 or in your dream 100 list.

 

[4:53:05] Yeah, Bogdan is saying we can actually use that to our advantage to create urgency or have them speed up the process, especially if they're competing for budget with other departments. Yeah.

 

[4:53:30] I mean, you you can absolutely take what typically is like a a pessimistic view. Remember we talked about optimism earlier. A pessimistic view about a budget cycle and not being able to catch it at the right time is you could actually flip it.

 

[4:54:00] And when you talk to the stakeholders, even if you're out of cycle, you generate some you use a use some techniques to generate some urgency around that. Right? The budget goes fast typically, but we wanted to set you up for success, right? Have that type of conversation.

 

[4:54:30] All right. So, we covered video prospecting. How many of you guys got something out of that? And special thanks of course to I'll have to say you know super super thanks to the Sarge as a Sarge led us through several iterations of developing the skill of video prospecting.

 

[4:55:00] So, if the Sarge is still here in the chat, just wanted to give the Sarge my appreciation. And also here today with with Adam with all of his passion, enthusiasm for helping people and also sharing his experiences around closing.

 

[4:55:30] Adam has also been a pivotal part of our community. And special thanks to Adam for essentially being a a guest instructor today as well.

 

[4:55:55] Thank you so much, Rich, for having me. This was a great honor and a great pleasure too.

[4:56:15] Yes. So today we covered the let me let me see if we can just go through one more time. So our two motivators we got two motivators and two mindsets. Can somebody if you guys are on top of it? You guys aren't asleep yet. Go ahead and list those four things just to see if you guys remember.

 

[4:56:45] Let's see who gets it first. So they got the first one. Okay. David got two of them. Vincent as well. Ke has the other two. Perfect. And then what are the mindsets now? Simple but effective. We've got yes. Optimism and hunger. They're getting it.

 

[4:57:20] Okay. And when we look at companies, do we look at them from a very traditional big list perspective? How do we look at those partners personalize? Yep. Dream 100. In our case, we like to say ultra 100 list and starting with some of ours. Great. Looks like you guys are catching on.

NÚMEROS: 4 roots, 4 mindsets, múltiplas estratégias, táticas

 

VISUAL: Árvore completa mostrando todos os componentes dos 2 módulos

 

[4:57:55] Over the course of the last two sessions, guys, this is what we covered. Just so that we we actually had four four different routes we covered for the motivation piece. Stacked on top of that is of course four areas of mindset that prospecting at least the way we do it here cannot be done effectively without.

 

[4:58:30] And then of course from a strategy perspective we talked about being intentional about how we use our time, how we set set up this the calendar, how we wake up and and start each day.

 

[4:58:55] And then also today like how do how do we look at leveraging and creating that list that gives you the multiple return on investment, right? Return on your time invested and return on all the all the research that you've you've been doing.

 

[4:59:25] Tactics. We covered emails and messaging with Sean last week, the last session. And then of course we touched upon video prospecting today.

 

[4:59:50] So after covering some of this, let's go back to the word associations very quickly. When you look at these phrases like a five-month deal cycle, doing video selfies or doing video resume and closing calls on videos, are you guys do you guys feel a little bit different about those? You feel a little bit more it's not as strange to you. It's not like as impossible to do. There's there's there's a process now, right?

 

[5:00:25] Yeah. Actually, let us know in the chat how do you feel about it right now? Grant says better. Williams says, "Awesome." Oh. Sergeant is asking us to do the push-ups. 20 videos. Ultra helpful. Ultra helpful. Nice.

 

[5:00:55] All right. Do we have some nets in place potentially? Do we have a a a way to build and source these nets?

 

[5:01:10] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Assignments"

 

NÚMEROS: 4 tarefas principais

 

VISUAL: Lista de assignments com checkboxes: Ultra 100 List, Video Scripts, Practice Videos, Accountability Partner

 

[5:01:15] Some assignments for you guys. Stay engaged. I I want I really truly if you got something out of this content I think the real measure for that sometimes is like can you regurgitate can you teach somebody else can you share what you've learned.

 

[5:01:45] So as we talked about as ground rules at the beginning of the session today is like stay engaged share some of the things that you've learned if you can put it into practice you're not going to forget it you're going to be able to recall and apply and get get the results that that you're looking for.

 

[5:02:15] So as part of the assignment I would say first thing is start creating that list, right? Post it somewhere, make it visible, have an engagement plan, and do it daily. Okay?

 

[5:02:40] You're doing exactly what Bogden and his his dad started doing many, many years ago, which is creating that unshakable unshakable pipeline.

 

[5:03:05] Second thing is create a video script for at least three of your list people, your partners. See what that looks like. The actual exercise of creating the script is not as easy as it looks. We went through that, but at least now you have a framework.

 

[5:03:35] Finally, show everybody, right? Show everybody that actually the process is doable. Post a screenshot of a short clip. The sergeant is saying do 20. I would take one of those 20. Post a short clip of that in the community and show people that you actually can do this, right? And and ask for feedback.

 

[5:04:05] Finally, if it helps, and we we did this as a team with Sarge, with with Adam, with everybody here on the bisdev team, find accountability partner. I did this with actually Raphael.

 

[5:04:30] Found find an accountability partner to give and receive feedback for your video. Okay, that's pretty important. That's the only way you're going to get better. Prototype it. Get that feedback.
