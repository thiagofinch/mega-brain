[01:50] I mean, right. Well, why do I want to become a sales manager? I don't plan to lead or manage a sales team, right? Like, you know, it's not really for me. I never even thought about being a manager in general. How is this relevant?

 

[02:05] You know, I'm a high ticket closer. I'm an ultra high ticket closer. You know, I close sales. I don't really think much about leading or managing a team. So, you know, I'm not so interested, right? Like, I don't really need this. And, you know, that's kind of why we have a low turnout, right? It could very well be.

[03:15] What we're going to share tonight is not just applicable to sales and management. What this means is this is not just for if you want to become a sales manager, right? In fact, it's not even if you want to be a manager or even a leader. This applies to you today, right now in your life.

 

[03:35] And as we go through the class tonight, you see how it applies in your personal life, your relationships, even with your friends, family, siblings, spouse, right? Even with your kids and pets, everyone, right?

 

[03:50] It's not a sales department breakfast. We're not here to tell you about all the cool things that the sales department does, right? We're not interested in that. We're here to share what we found that works so that you can implement, that you can apply, and that you can bring to your own businesses, your own influencers, your own life, and apply it to basically advance life forward and get to where you want to be, get to that next level in where you want to be in life.

 

[04:20] It's not just show and tell. We're not just going to sit here and show you kind of some cool features and things and tips and tricks. We're actually going to show you how to implement, to actually show how it works, right, in real life. We're going to have a bunch of role plays.

 

[04:35] It's not just theory, right? The last thing we want is theory, a class on theory. It's not just high-level conceptual stuff. It's battle-tested strategies and tactics that work.

[04:50] And the last bit of it is it's not to be taken lightly, right? Really not to be taken lightly. You know, if you're just here to browse around and jump on class and jump off in an hour or 30 minutes, then you're really going to miss out on a lot, right?

 

[05:05] You're really going to miss out if you're just in and out, right? Because, again, like I have to emphasize, it is not just for management and sales, right? It applies to everything you do.

 

[05:15] Just like how, you know, can you guys put in Discord how we remember in HTC, when we went through HTC, weeks one and week two were so crucial to our foundation as closers, right? Would you agree? Put in the chat. Weeks one and weeks two of HTC, right?

 

[05:35] So just think of it the same way. This is like the week one and week two of HTC for literally leading and managing teams, right, in your life. Because the first person you have to manage and lead is really yourself before you can then have a team of your own, right?

[06:00] So if you agree with me, that's fantastic. And this is what you are going to get out of tonight. So you're never going to look at leadership and management the same way ever again. After tonight, we promise that you will never look at these two terms the way you did in the past.

 

[06:20] And the next part, obviously, this is the fun part. I think what a lot of people like, how would you like to manage your time and priorities like billionaires, exactly what Bill Gates and Elon Musk does, right? Their time block strategies. We're going to cover that tonight.

[07:15] And this is probably one of my favorite parts, but how do you balance the use of the carrot versus the stick, or as we can call it in, I guess, simple term, how do you balance discipline consequences versus rewards, right? And actual motivation through goals, goal setting. And of course, much, much, much more.

 

[07:35] So I can see that the attendance is going up slightly. It's going up. So thanks for tagging your brothers and sisters, but it's still not where we want it to be. So as we move on, they are going to be missing out on a lot of good stuff in the beginning.

 

[07:50] So please get them on class. Keep bringing them on. Keep messaging them. If you're on Facebook, on WhatsApp, on Telegram, that's fine, right? Spam those groups. Let them know we're live.

[08:40] I am Joel Goh, and I am the director of sales as well as business relationships for the Dan Lok organization. I started my closing career in season five of HTC, closed for a bunch of influencers. I think you guys heard my story, how I then joined Sifu's closing team about a year and a half ago.

[09:25] So what I've done so far is I've actually managed about $15 million plus in high ticket sales for Sifu and his company. So in the past year and a half, $15 million. Actually, including the sales that I've closed and deals that I've brokered, it's about $20 plus mil, right?

[10:25] But I joined HTC in season eight, which is in January of 2019. And originally I started with being a paralegal. So for me, it was the regular nine to five paralegal job that I was kind of sick of doing. It was so routine. It was so boring. I mean, money aside, because it didn't even it just paid enough to barely pay the bills.

VISUAL: Comparação visual entre líderes e gerentes, percepção tradicional

 

[11:50] I would say 50-50, right? Like some people said leaders, some people say managers. I think a bit more did say really leaders. And let me ask you guys this, right? On this next slide, not on this slide, this is really what you want your tombstone to say.

 

[12:10] On this slide, how many of you guys, and this is where it goes with the sort of the conditioning and upbringing, right? And all the, I don't want to say brainwashing, but it's really what we've been conditioned with. How many of you guys have seen this, right?

NÚMEROS: Não especificado

 

VISUAL: Comparação negativa de gerentes: apenas mandam, gritam, criticam, defendem ego vs líderes: aprendem, buscam soluções, encorajam

 

[12:30] Leaders lead the team. Managers just tell people to work, right? Leaders do it together. Managers just shout at people from behind and don't do crap, right? A boss or a boss really a manager, they know it all. They criticize, they defend their ego, they focus on themselves, right?

 

[12:50] Leaders, they want to learn. They want to seek solution and encourage, right? So you can see, how many of you have grown up with this, right? Like I did, I personally did. Like knowing really the definition, this is really a definition thing, right?

 

[13:10] It's purely English definitions that managers were seen as so much worse than leaders. Like I grew up with that definition. You know, I grew up like learning that, right? I always learn, even in the army, even in the military, I always learn that being a leader was better than being a manager because I don't know, for some reason we think manager, we somehow think like micromanagement.

 

[13:35] We somehow think people who don't do anything, they just tell you what to do. They don't care. They don't care about you. They just want you to do stuff, right? I grew up with that, right? How many of you grew up with that too, right?

 

[13:50] Because I don't think I'm the only one. I think this is like conventional wisdom. I think most of the world gets this knowledge, right? Yeah, exactly, right? And there's nothing wrong with that. It's definition, right? Definitely, I agree, right? You know, a manager is a bad, leaders are good. You don't want to be a manager. You want to be a leader, right?

NÚMEROS: Não especificado

 

VISUAL: Conceito revolucionário: gerente como nível mais alto de liderança

 

[14:20] Now, Larry actually challenged us and really, I would say, destroyed this preconceived notion or this perspective, you know, during that training. And he argues that the highest level, the best level you could strive to be is truly a manager.

 

[14:40] I'm going to repeat that once more. The highest level of whatever you want to call it, leadership management, the highest pinnacle, you really want to be a manager. Ideally, right? Ideally. So in the next couple of slides, we are going to talk about why. Why is that? And what is the actual definition of that manager versus leader?

 

[15:05] And bear in mind, not only is, not only, I mean, I'm just saying, not just saying this because Larry is a Navy SEAL commander, which obviously holds a lot of weight in itself. But even Larry told me, because I spoke with him after the event.

 

[15:20] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Military Perspective"

 

NÚMEROS: 6 meses de treinamento, Old Six, Old Five (patentes militares)

 

VISUAL: Experiência militar: US Army, ROTC, Navy SEAL Commander Larry

 

[15:25] For those of you that don't know, I'm also a commissioned officer in the US Army. In fact, in six months, I have to go in for full-time training again with the Army for a couple of months. So I'll be back in a military environment, right? For a while. So you guys actually won't be seeing me for a bit next year.

 

[15:45] I asked him, I said, hey, you know, Larry, it's interesting. I learned in ROTC, which is the Reserve Office of Training Corps, as well as in the Army. And I was enlisted for a couple of years before I commissioned. I learned that being a leader is better than being a manager, Larry. I said that to him, right?

 

[16:10] I said, Larry, you know, I love what you're saying, but even in the military, even in my colonels, right? Colonels, the old six, old five, the generals, they said that being a leader was better. So why would you say that being a manager is actually the pinnacle?

 

[16:30] So Larry even agreed. He said, yeah, I agree with you. Even in the military, they've got it backwards. Like they have, we have not got this definition really nailed down. So by the end of class tonight, you will see what Larry and I will mean when we actually say that a manager is a pinnacle of leadership, right?

 

[16:55] It's really interesting. So, you know, right now you might have that debate like, hmm, I'm not so sure. You know, I don't really, I still think leadership is sort of the top, the pinnacle. But let me challenge that. Let me show you some proof, some evidence, some examples, and then we can talk about, then we can talk about what you actually, the aha moments you have in a class, right?

[17:25] So here we go. This is even our Dan Lok organizations, right? Our six type of members. I want to start with this first before I go into the explanation of why. Even Sifu, right? Our company. I want to walk you guys through this so it actually makes a bit of sense. And you can read the definitions to kind of get a basic understanding before I go deeper.

 

[17:50] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Level 1: Loser"

 

NÚMEROS: Nível 1, 100% responsabilidade

 

VISUAL: Nível mais baixo: fazendo coisas erradas, responsabilidade do gerente

 

[17:55] So in TDL, right? If you are a part of it, even as a student, someone who's volunteering, working with us, you've always got levels, right? So at level one, which none of us wants to be, is a loser, right? How many of us wants to be a loser? No one wants to be a loser, right? And you don't necessarily start there, right? Some people just happen to be there, unfortunately.

 

[18:20] Now, by the way, interestingly, a loser is someone who's doing the things they're not supposed to do. But let me ask you guys this. Whose responsibility really is on, right? If you've got a loser on your team, right? Is it really that individual's, like, is it 100% his or her fault? Or could it be the direct report?

 

[18:40] So William says manager. Yep, exactly, right? So sometimes in this level, right, we cannot just blame that individual himself or herself. Because as the manager, I might have to take extreme ownership if I did not give clear directions to my team.

 

[19:00] You know, for example, if my team was supposed to close sales, but then they were all somehow ending up on Photoshop designing graphics, right? Whose fault is that? Think about it. We would say, oh, well, they're losers because they're not doing what they're supposed to do.

 

[19:20] But me as the manager, I have not set them up for success, right? I've set them up for failure. Why did I let them, you know, play Photoshop? And now why did I not kind of curtail them and kind of see what they're doing to actually produce results?

 

[19:40] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Level 2: Doer"

 

NÚMEROS: Nível 2, 6 meses, 50-50

 

VISUAL: Nível mínimo: fazendo o básico, padrão aceitável para novos

 

[19:45] So let's say we passed the loser stage, right? And we go up to doer. So doer is sort of the minimum. I wouldn't even say minimum. I would say, like, it's sort of where at the very least you start there if you're in TDL, where you're kind of doing just what you're supposed to do. Like you're just basically doing the minimum, right? You're doing the standard, you know?

 

[20:10] Acceptable when someone is new, not acceptable for six months. Great, right? Then you move up. This is kind of where the bare standard, the bare, like, bottom line, you've got to be there, you know, you're a player.

 

[20:25] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Level 3: Player"

 

NÚMEROS: Nível 3

 

VISUAL: Trabalho em equipe efetivo, resolução proativa de problemas

 

[20:30] You can work effectively as a team. You can proactively solve problems before they come up. And again, leadership is not a trait. And this is where we're going to go in really deep tonight. Leadership is not a trait.

 

[20:45] Although, like, what again, preconceived notions and what we brought up, we learned that leadership is a trait you can develop. We would argue that leadership is not a trait. Leadership is a collection. It's basically the result of a collection of actions and decisions that you make, effective decisions, right?

 

[21:10] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Level 4: Leader"

 

NÚMEROS: Nível 4

 

VISUAL: Liderança como resultado de ações efetivas, não como traço de personalidade

 

[21:15] So we all lead and follow and switch roles constantly. And then you become a leader, again, right? Controversial because some people say leaders on top, right? Managers on the bottom, but you become a leader where you take effective action, you make effective decisions, and therefore, because of your actions, evoke effective actions in others, right?

 

[21:40] Does this make sense? I want everyone to understand this and let me know whether that definition makes sense to you, right? As a leader, you take the best possible action at the time. We're going to go over some examples to kind of hammer that home.

 

[22:00] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Level 5: Operator"

 

NÚMEROS: Nível 5

 

VISUAL: Pensamento sistêmico, pensamento estratégico, uso de dados

 

[22:05] As an operator, you know, you think big. Like, this is great where you start being thinking systems, right? You think about systems thinkers or strategic thinkers, right? And you start creating systems and procedures so that your team, so that your company can continually move forward, obviously using data, right?

 

[22:30] I think a lot of emeralds here like to think that they operate really well, and I would say, yeah, that's possible, right? Now, can you get up to that level five is the next question, right? Actually use the data, analyze it for the right things, for the right actions to take.

 

[22:50] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Level 6: Manager"

 

NÚMEROS: Nível 6 - mais alto

 

VISUAL: Nível pinnacle: prever futuro, criar/habilitar/suportar líderes

 

[22:55] And then lastly, managers, right? Level six, the highest, the pinnacle, the tip of the iceberg, where you can get to. You predict and prepare for the future. You create, enable, and support leaders.

 

[23:10] Now, again, gonna dive a lot deeper into the definitions and what this really means, but just to give you a basic framework so you understand, this is where we lie in terms of the definition within our organization, right?

 

[23:25] Okay, so here comes the fun part. Who's then by effective actions. All right, does that make sense? I'm gonna say it one more time. Leadership is not a trait. It is represented by effective actions, right?

 

[23:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Leadership = Effective Actions"

 

NÚMEROS: Não especificado

 

VISUAL: Liderança definida por ações, não por características pessoais

 

[23:50] So your actions define how good of a leader you are. That's basically what it means, okay? So let me move on to this next slide, which you've got, right?

 

[24:05] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Lead Following Concept"

 

NÚMEROS: 24-7 mencionado

 

VISUAL: Dança entre liderar e seguir, alternância constante de papéis

 

[24:10] So in the moment though, in the moment, in the room scenario, right? Let's basically come back to this again one more time. I wanna point out something really important, right? We are all lead followers at every given time and always in the practice of lead following.

 

[24:30] And this is really important, right? Lead followers and lead following the whole concept of that, right? Let me define that for you. Lead following is really the dance between taking the lead and following others, right?

 

[24:45] So in life, you know, we would argue, we would say that we really are always 24-7 lead following, right? Meaning you're dancing between taking the lead sometimes and you're dancing between following others sometimes. Now, would you agree that's true, right?

 

[25:05] And a husband, like I'm married, right? Husband's wife, I'm not always in charge. Sometimes Jaden makes the decisions, right? She calls the moves, right? I've got to follow, I've got to dance to that tune. So I'm following in that scenario, right?

 

[25:25] Business as well, yeah, exactly. Lead following is the dance between really taking the lead and following others, okay? So have we sort of like, let me, before we move on to the whole manager definition, right?

 

[25:40] Because that's the bottom line, that's like the hammer in the, that's like a nail in the coffin, right? We're gonna hammer that home. Put in this chord if you sort of get and understand the definition and the difference between followers and leaders, right?

 

[26:00] We've only talked about really leaders and followers so far, is that clear to you, right? We always lead follow, but whoever makes the most effective action in that situation and time becomes a leader. And that's okay, and that's for that time, right? Great.

 

[26:20] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Manager Definition"

 

NÚMEROS: Não especificado

 

VISUAL: Gerente = autoridade posicional + título

 

[26:25] Now, here is what happens with managers. So I'm going to define managers, and I think this is where some of us are going to get a little, not ticked off, but a little, like if you're gonna tickle you in some way, because this might go against what you actually grew up with, right?

 

[26:45] So here's how I'm gonna define a manager, okay? You become a manager by having positional authority. That's literally it. Like, that's it. You become a manager just by having positional authority, and done, that's it.

 

[27:05] And now, positional authority comes with a title, okay? Here's where it gets interesting. These titles can come from anything from a CEO, department head, superintendent, lawyer, attorney, even unofficial, like father, wife, dad, mom, friend, right?

 

[27:25] But all those titles still carry the same management responsibilities, right? So is this clear, guys? I want to kind of define what goes against the grain, what kind of goes against what we've learned, grew up with.

 

[27:40] It's really the definition of a manager is you have positional authority, and you have a title. That's really what Larry is saying, right? And we're gonna go deeper again, right? But I just want to define that first, okay?

 

[27:55] Have we defined the roles of leader, manager, and follower, right? Have we established that? Say yes in Discord. Have we defined that? We need to be all clear on this step, right?

 

[28:10] Yeah, and Chris, we're gonna get there as well. I see Chris's comment, yep. So here's very interesting, right? Larry's found that SEALS, right, Navy SEALS, that are the best, most effective managers, guess what they don't do?

[29:20] Okay, so here is where it gets fun. It's this right here, right? We've covered this. And yeah, really, it's what it is, right? As a manager, you have an obligation to manage, but it is a choice to lead.

 

[29:35] Again, I'm going to repeat that. You have an obligation to manage, but it is a choice to lead. And Chris, this goes to kind of what you're saying. We're going to expand on it a little bit more.

VISUAL: Criar ambiente que habilita líderes, depois seguir esses líderes

 

[29:55] Read the second paragraph with me, guys. The most effective managers, they create an environment that enables and supports those who lead. Okay, this is the key. Then they follow their leaders.

 

[30:10] Right, how beautiful is that, right? Can you just imagine that, right? The most effective managers, they create an environment that enables and supports their leaders, and then all they do is just follow their leaders from that moment on, right?

 

[30:30] They put their trust in there. They put a trust in them. They support them. They acknowledge them, and they just back them, and they go with the leaders. They trust the leaders and move on, right?

 

[30:45] So, Chris, when you brought up, yes, developing leaders, that's exactly it, right? You can't have leaders unless you develop them. So managers need to develop them, need to groom them, need to help them grow, and most importantly, create that environment so their leaders are successful, right?

 

[31:05] They need to be able to set their leaders up for success. And that is why there's a huge distinction between managers and leaders, right? This is the huge difference.

[31:25] So that's a great question, Chris. We're going to cover that as well. Here's a scenario, right, that might resonate with you guys. So I'm going to give you guys a scenario. You guys are probably all kind of feel me on this one, right?

 

[31:40] Let's say I gave you a task, okay? Let's just give you an example, right? I gave you a task. You know, I say, you know what, Patrick or Chris or Philip or Zachary or John, right, you guys are closer.

 

[31:55] And I say, you know what, guys, you guys are going to go HubSpot right now on our CRM, and you're going to upload all your contacts that you've sort of spoke to at our event last week because you guys were offline. You guys were meeting them in person. I want you to upload all the information to HubSpot, right? Okay?

 

[32:15] And you guys say, good, got it. Yeah, I got it. Simple, right? Now imagine this, right? I stand over your shoulder, and I'm still giving you more directions, but I'm giving you wrong direction, and I'm annoying you in your ear.

 

[32:30] Hey, Zach, you're doing that wrong. Hey, you got to do it this way. No, no, no, Philip, I don't like that. You got to do it this way. No, no, no. You clicked the wrong button, Chris. Do it this way. No, no, no. And I'm in your ear for the next two hours yelling at you.

 

[32:50] What do you call that type of manager? All together now, what do you call that type of manager?

 

[32:55] Yeah, you guys all got it, right? You guys all got it. Micromanagers, yes. Micromanagers, yes, exactly. We don't like micromanagers, and to be honest, that's where the whole manager, Kyle's in my wife. That's funny. Oh, man.

 

[33:15] And that's where management gets a whole bad rep, right? When people say manager, they automatically think of micromanager, and that's just, it's just sad. That's how management gets such a bad rep, such a negative reputation on that, right? And we want to kind of clear that air now. We want to break that apart, okay?

[33:45] So let's kind of figure, let's kind of solidify this and summarize all of this again, right? Again, now, mind you, Larry's training that day was three, four hours long. I'm compacting this to at least 15, 20, if not 30 minutes, right?

 

[34:05] I'm trying to summarize a lot for it. So I'm kind of cutting a little on edge, but I hope this really gives you, that paints you that big picture, right? Because we need this context before we move on.

 

[34:20] Because when I use the terms management later, leadership later, you're going to understand what I actually mean. Because I don't want you to get confused when I say lead, you might think manage. When I say manage, you might think lead. So that's really important, right?

[34:45] So let's go and finally, let's just finally define this really quick. So leaders really create, they also create environments. Yeah, leaders kind of create environments because leaders create environments for followers to make the right choices, right?

 

[35:05] They evoke effective actions, but they also have to allow followers to make the right choices, right? So they set them up for success. Now, managers create environments that support these lead followers in making the right choices, right? That's really what management is, creating those environments and developing those leaders, okay?

And this part, even though you might think, well, it's not really a big part, but it actually is, I would say the biggest, if not one of the biggest parts of this equation, the followers.

 

[35:55] Because bottom line, guys, gals, without followers, nothing can happen.

[36:10] Again, right? I'm the director of sales for Christy and Felix kind of fall under my management, right? And they report directly to me and I report directly to Sifu. But I always tell Christy and Felix, you know, guys, like both everyone in the team, the goal really here is for you to outgrow where you are today.

 

[36:35] Like the first step is to know more about your specialty, about what you do than I would, right? I tell Christy and Felix, Christy, you've got to be the expert in B2C sales much more than me. Felix, same thing for B2B sales, right?

 

[36:55] I should be coming to Felix and Christy and asking them more about B2C and B2B sales, right? Than the other way around. And that's really my sort of my way I view leadership, right? I want them, really as a manager, right? I want them to know more than I do.

 

[37:15] And my other goal is, I've always had this motto, right? In 12 months, I don't want to see you on my team. Like, and it's funny, right? People are often confused. They're like, what? What do you mean? You don't like me?

 

[37:30] No, it's just, I want you to outgrow this team. I want you to move on. I want you to go do better things. I want you to move on, like move on with your life and get better. It makes me proud. It makes me happy when you move on.

 

[37:50] So just treat the 12 months as, you know, you're learning, you're growing, you're doing well. But really, I want you to have your own, either if it's on your own goals, right? You have your own team of your own, right? Your perspective, whatever you want to achieve, go and do it, right?

 

[38:10] And nothing makes me happier than leaving, me leaving me, right? Felix says, bye, Joe. Yeah, Felix, bye. Like, really time, it's time for you guys to move on, right? And so that's really what it is. But we're not going to get there unless we learn, right? We're not going to get there unless we learn.

 

[38:30] And we're not going to get there unless we grow, right? And so I'm going to let Felix and Christy continue. I mean, they're going to recommend some books as well. And this is all like great stuff. Oh, Felix, go ahead.

VISUAL: Transformação de ódio por leitura para amor por aprendizado

 

[38:50] Yeah, before we jump on the next slide, one thing that I see learning, right? Like, I used to, I born, raised, hate reading. Like, reading is like, why are we reading books? It's boring. Every time I read a page or two, I just fall asleep, right?

 

[39:10] But when I see reading books, it does this. It really changed the way I see reading. It's not just reading for the sake of learning new things. But the way I see reading and learning in general is to keep my brain running with new ideas.

 

[39:30] You're getting new ideas. You are keeping your brain running with something new into your brain. So you're not just constantly feeding the same thing to yourself. You're not recycling things that you have in your body, but you're bringing new things to your brain.

[39:55] And what does that encourage? That encourage creativity. And when you have creativity, that's when you are aligning with that growth mindset that you need, not the fixed mindset.

 

[40:10] Fixed mindset is like you're recycling the same concept, same mindset you have over and over again. But when you're reading, when you're talking to people, when you're experiencing, when you're implementing new things, you are building new things into your brains to really experience it.

 

[40:30] You know, it essentially, what's that does, right? When we say manager would take effective actions. And another way to see it is to solve problems faster, right? That's where this slide is coming from.

 

[40:45] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Problem Solving Through Learning"

VISUAL: Resolver problemas mais rápido = tornar-se líder no ambiente

 

[40:50] How do you solve problems faster? When you're being a good problem solver, how do you think you can help the team and yourself? You immediately become that leader within the environment already because people come to you with problem and you can just like, boom, I solved the problem for you.

 

[41:10] That's one of the things that changed entirely the way I see learning. Now, one thing I wanted to address, there is a question that Andrew had, which is a really good question. Aren't there other ways of getting ideas besides reading?

 

[41:25] The short answer is yes. However, from my experience, from before when I'm like, oh, I don't want to read. Like even in high school and college, okay. Being a paralegal student, I was still like, I don't want to do this, right?

 

[41:45] But I have found that videos go only so far. Videos go so far, college goes so far because everybody also has their own set of way of teaching it, their own interpretations of it.

 

[42:00] Even though books have the same thing as well, if you actually pick books from people that have proven results, that's actually where's the best place to start. And I think that nothing can truly replace reading those kinds of books, which actually gets us to our next slide.

[42:25] Yeah. So I'm going to talk about the middle book and the right book because that's really what any manager that joins the team now. This really is if you do decide to jump in the world of sales management, right?

 

[42:40] Meaning if you do see yourself becoming a sales manager, right? Eventually leading a sales team or managing a sales team, you want to get down that road. The Sales Manager Survival Guide is a book I make every manager read.

 

[42:55] Like Felix, Christy, Phil, James, they've all read it, right? Top Grading for Sales is a book that Des Desarch got me to read when I first started. It's amazing too. So, you know, these books are like a must, right? And then Felix, do you want to talk a bit about Limitless?

 

[43:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Limitless Book"

 

NÚMEROS: 7 mentiras, 120 IQ mencionado

 

VISUAL: Livro sobre aprender a aprender, eliminar crenças limitantes

 

[43:20] Yeah, 100%. So I have actually recently got this book and I love this book a lot because I love practical things. I love things that apply to learning a lot. It's like a book that you can learn how to learn.

 

[43:35] And it eliminates a lot of the lies that you're telling yourself about learning, right? I'm going to read out a couple lies that he's dispelling, the seven lies of learning.

 

[43:50] So one of them is your intelligence is fixed, right? How many of you, you know, you would think like, ah, yeah, you know, we have the IQ, we have a certain number of intelligence and that's it. Like, that's everything I could do. I have that, right?

 

[44:10] Oh, I'm fixed. I'm, you know, 120 IQ and that's it. I can't go beyond that. We are constantly putting a box into ourselves. This is who we are, but we never think about who can we become.

 

[44:30] So this book definitely helps us to not only talk about some lies that we tell ourselves, but some practical things they can do, even food that you can eat to really develop your brain into a way that you see learning is just something effective, something great, something like a habit.

 

[44:50] You don't have to think about it. You just learn without you having that willpower to do it. So I got a lot from that. So definitely recommend you guys to get that book and, you know, get a couple of things that you can implement right away. That's definitely helpful.

 

[45:10] And, you know, you can kind of see why we started the whole kind of class tonight on learning because the bottom line is this and Felix and Christy and I think a lot of HTM leaders and managers can attest to it, but you're never going to be a manager if you don't enjoy learning.

 

[45:30] That's just like period, right? Like if you don't like learning, you don't like growth, like you will not progress far. You just won't lead people, right? It's just not, it's something you won't be able to do effectively.

 

[45:45] Like you could like kind of ineffectively, but not ineffective level, not in a high performance winning team that that's not possible, right? So it's really important we start with the most important point tonight, which is it sounds simple, but again, how many people like I'm going to ask in Discord, how many people are actually learning every single day, right?

 

[46:10] Like constantly and not just like actively learning. Like it's something simple to say and I feel like it's something we say and then people just forget and they don't do, but because it's so simple, it sounds so simple.

 

[46:25] It's like, oh, learning, I learn all my life, right? I went to school, I went to college. Yeah, you know, I learn, I learn, you know, I read the newspaper. I kind of do stuff at work. I got some hands-on experience. I'm learning, but the reality is if you don't have an active conscious effort in learning the things you want to get better at, like progressing, like let's say you want to be a sales manager, obviously you want to, you got to learn sales management, right?

 

[47:00] The best way to learn is from experience, of course, but at the same time, there's so many books out there that have been written to solve all the potential dilemmas and issues and problems that you come up with as a sales manager.

 

[47:15] And that's the same thing that applies to almost like to every problem, every like, there's no problem in the world that no one has written a book on yet. Like I'm willing to bet money there is zero like issues, except maybe the new, you know, technological, scientific stuff that have never been invented yet.

 

[47:35] Yeah, sure. Like how to solve COVID, how to vaccinate COVID-19 or solve it. Okay, that one's probably not yet created yet, but it is being created. But any other possible issue you can think of in the world, there is someone that...

 

[47:50] But any other possible issue you can think of in the world, there is someone that has written about it, has experienced it, and has documented solutions for it.

[48:10] Let me not sabotage the person. Let me not indirectly mess up their career, right? Some people do that, right? It's a real thing. So these are things where when we say understand your team members are at, it goes both ways, right? It goes both ways.

 

[48:30] And like what Schnurr said, where's your Ruby? And it's very common. Yeah, exactly. So yeah, so I think Felix. Actually, you know what? I want to start with this one first because as equally important as understanding where your team is at, it's equally important, if not even more important, to understand where upper management is at, right?

VISUAL: Hierarquia de reporte: Felix/Christy → Joel → Sifu → Jenny

 

[49:00] And I'll give you a perfect scenario right now because right now to Felix and Christy, I am upper management, right? Because they report to me and then to Sifu, he's my upper management, right? So Felix and Christy report to me, I report to Sifu, right?

 

[49:20] So we all have upper management, right? And to Sifu and Jenny, right? It's upper management. I don't know what it is, right? And Jenny has no one else. But yeah, you got to understand, right? Sifu says that a lot.

 

[49:35] But so upper management, right? Like this is so crucial because I've worked with managers, quote unquote managers, who I inherited a team. And one of the biggest things that grinds my gears is this, which we'll cover in effective communication, right?

 

[49:55] We'll cover this in the next couple slides. When I gave a task to them and explained the why, instead of like dissecting the task and filtering the task, you know, guess what they did, right? They just copy and pasted the task, copied it word for word and just pasted it to the team.

 

[50:15] Like literally no words, no edits, nothing, right? So I'm talking to, let's say, you know, to manager A, manager A just copy and paste my text message to the rest of the team. And I'm like, that's like management 101. Like how do you even not know?

[50:40] And it's kind of like, well, again, it's extreme ownership. Like for me, I have to ask myself, first of all, you know, did I even coach or train the guy to know what's the right way, what's not the right way? Second of all, like, is this the second time he's done it, the first time, the third time, right?

 

[51:00] Like it goes back to me too. So yes, as much as I'm frustrated, I also have to take extreme ownership always at myself, right? But yeah, so what are their beliefs? What are their OKRs, objective key results, right?

VISUAL: Comparação entre abordagem de cima para baixo vs de baixo para cima

 

[51:25] And then bottom-up approach, I want to cover this a little bit because we're also going to talk a little bit about the whole bottom-up versus top-down approach in the next slide. Yeah, so I would say, you know, and I'll let Felix and Christy chime in with examples, but bottom-up approach really is like perfect scenario, right?

 

[51:50] Obviously in the Dan Lok organization, we want to get, you know, as much sales as we can and the best customer experience, right? So naturally the goal is to get the most revenue, right? Can you guys follow that? It kind of makes sense. We want to get the most sales as possible, yeah? Makes sense, right?

 

[52:15] So naturally for me, obviously when I go to Christy and Felix, I go, well, I mean guys, really bottom line is we want to double or triple our sales that we did like last quarter, right? We just want to knock it out of the park, right? Obviously. That's natural, right?

 

[52:35] Now, the top-down approach would just to be like Christy and Felix goes to the closers and be like, all right guys, you know, you heard the boss. We got to get, I don't know, five million sales this quarter. Let's all do it. Boom, let's go. You can't make it. We're all done. I'm going to fire all of you, right? Like that's really top-down.

 

[52:55] Now, that really doesn't answer like, you know, are we actually going to achieve like what are the actual steps we're going to hit that, right? Like what the actual vehicles to get there, right?

 

[53:10] Bottom-up would just be, hey, you know, let's talk to the closers first. You know, I get that you want five million, Joel, right? I get that. But, you know, let me talk to the team. You know, by the way, they've been at this level in performance the past six months.

 

[53:30] Let's look at historical trends. You know, what are we able to do? What is marketing able to do? Let's work as a team, right? Like that's bottom-up approach, right? So it's pretty important. Yeah, so Christy, Felix.

 

[53:50] I'm going off a little bit of a tangent here, like just with regards to what you're hearing from the up and down. Managing that is like an art. And this is something that I've been constantly, I wouldn't say struggling with, but it's a great challenge to have because it's like you're building a relationship with two different parties while you have to be very firm, you know, with towards the upper management and also to your team.

 

[54:20] So how to maintain that was definitely a big challenge to me. And one thing that I learned a lot throughout the time when I'm working with the team, working with Joel, is that I constantly have problem seeing what the upper management are seeing, right?

 

[54:40] What are their beliefs? What do they see? Why do they set this? And translate that in within me and lead them to the team. So this is almost something that that's why communications, right? Never be afraid to ask for help.

 

[55:00] These kind of things, it comes down to one-on-one with your managers, with your team to really speak things out, to really let them understand that where are you struggling with. And don't make like decisions that you think, oh yeah, this is the best decision. There's no best decision.

 

[55:20] So when you're new to managing teams, when you have upper management and you have a team that you're managing, you always have to not assume anything, always verify, right? And that's kind of what I also want to add onto the topic of understanding where your upper management is at.

 

[55:40] Because without doing that, you can't really deliver a good message to your team and your team could easily be confused of what you're trying to say. So that is something that I'm constantly working on as a manager myself.

[56:05] To kind of stack on that as well is that a big part of it is also managing our manager's expectations. Because, I mean, there's been times like Joel has very ambitious goals. And sometimes I'm like, you know, Joel, I'd love to hit it. But realistically, I think we're going to get to X.

 

[56:30] And he is perfectly fine with that. He's like, oh, okay, so how long is it going to take us to the goal that I think we can get? And then we start talking like that. And it comes from building that relationship as well with your upper management as well.

 

[56:50] Because even though we have one-on-ones with Joel, which again is very important to have, not just with your team, but also with the person who's managing you as well. But it gives us the ability to have that outside of work connection. It builds that personal bond.

 

[57:10] Because what that'll do is then we know where you're coming from, where I'm coming from. And when we have situations that it's like, okay, we need to really sit down and talk because you might have a personal problem that's going on that I can help you through.

 

[57:30] You know, that's something that I know that if it's affecting my work, I can go to Joel and he can help me as well. So it's not just, okay, how do I get my team to perform? Like, I don't get it. Like, you know, then it would be like, okay, that's a whole different conversation in itself.

 

[57:50] But if I'm like, you know, I'm having a bad day. I can't get past it. You know, he said this. I was trying to get this done. I think this is where I want to go. Can you help me out with this? You know, help get me past this. That's really also what the connection is for as well, get you over those extra hurdles when you need to ask for help on both sides.

[58:40] You know, your goal is like 50K, I'm going to do 5 million, right? Like, how many of you are like that, right? Yeah, like I'm 100% like that. So, you know, when Christy says my goals are over optimistic or over, like it really is.

 

[59:00] And now where I find even myself going through this challenge a lot is to really balance the perspective of like when is once too low, what is actually lower self versus what's actually reasonable, realistic, right?

 

[59:20] Because here's the bottom line, it's like, and this is a big challenge, like if you're in a high performing team, if you tell your direct report, hey, I don't think we can do that, you might come across as, oh, you're lower self, oh, you know, you're not a high achiever, oh, you know, you're not thinking big enough, right? Oh, you're not aiming for the moon, right?

 

[59:45] So it's like, it's actually a very real dilemma that we have to navigate, right? So like, you know, when Christy says, hey I...

[1:00:25] How many of you actually time block already? Like, so if I ask you, like, if I say, I mean, be bold, right? Bold, like, how long does your, I don't know, how long does your call reviews take for your closing calls, right?

 

[1:00:45] Like, great. Like, you should be able to tell me exactly how many minutes, right? Yeah, or hours, exactly. You should be able to say, yeah, Joel, you know, I've timed it. It's exactly 50 minutes, 45 minutes, exactly, right?

 

[1:01:05] That's good. You guys are already ahead. But for those of you that have not, I challenge you to really do this because it's so effective, right? And really that self-management and time management is all about eliminating distractions. That's really what it is. That's really what it is.

[1:01:30] And then this is recommended too. If you give yourself a reward, like when you first start time blocking, if you start rewarding yourself, especially when you're new to it, because it is really hard, like to get disciplined to follow a time block, it's hard at first, right?

 

[1:01:50] If you're like me, like at first I hated following a time block. You know, when it said 10 a.m. to 10.15, I gotta do this. I'm like, oh my God, like I really gotta switch over to do this right now, right? Like, can I not just spend two minutes to do this other thing again? Or can I just end this early? Can I check my phone?

 

[1:02:15] No, like dude, follow a time block. It's like that strict, right, of a time block. But you know, I give myself a reward, right? Hey, you know, you get a 20 minute break time or whatever, right? 10 minute, you know, check your phone, whatever, right? Like give yourself a small reward.

 

[1:02:35] And I love the last point. All of us in our life, we have the same amount of time available. Every single one of us, 24 hours a day, right? We just have the same amount of time, hours, minutes, seconds. It's just how we do it, what we do with it that matters. And that's really, really, really the key.

[1:03:05] So when we talk about self-management, what we really want to eliminate is our distractions, right? This is very, very interesting. This is very interesting. Like I'm gonna ask you guys a show of hands on a day-to-day basis, right?

 

[1:03:25] How many of you get distracted more than 10 times a day? 20? 50? 100? 200? 500? 1000? Oh yeah, for sure. Me too, right? Me probably like 30, 20, 40, yeah, a lot, like a lot, right? Depends on the day, but it's a lot, right?

 

[1:03:50] Like the whole reason about self-management, time management is all about eliminating distractions, right? Now, distractions is very, like they're very, very like, what do you call it? Obvious. It's like just your phone vibrating is a distraction. Just checking your phone is a distraction.

 

[1:04:10] Someone ringing your doorbell, someone calling your name, someone messaging you on Slack, Telegram, right? You see a notification, you check your email. Now, a distraction is defined as whatever kicks you off what you're focused on doing, right?

 

[1:04:30] So if you were checking Slack messages and you're checking your channel and you get a message, that's fine. That's not a distraction because you're checking Slack, right? But if you're working on like a paper or you're like on a phone call, you're closing, and you see a Slack message, obviously that's a distraction.

 

[1:04:50] Because the distraction is defined as what you're not focused on, what you're not focused working on. Anything outside that is a distraction. So if Sifu calls you, right? And we're gonna get into like what's the Eisenhower decision matrix, right? What's urgent and important and all that. Like what is an emergency, a code red?

 

[1:05:15] But if Sifu calls me, really legitimately, if it's not within my time block and he calls me, I have to ignore him. That's me respecting my time block. You guys might be like, whoa, what? You ignore Sifu? Wow, like you know, like yeah, like Sifu, I've got to respect my time block and you got to respect my time block.

 

[1:05:40] And here's the reason. Here's the reason why I've got to respect my time block is because I can focus on you, Sifu, when I have the time block out for you. 100 billion percent on you. And I'm more attentive, I'm fast, I'm effective, I'm efficient. I can get your stuff knocked out so fast.

 

[1:06:05] So if you just give me two hours, I've got a time block set up. I can knock out all that with you, right? Like it's like, it's legitimate like that. Like the exact same thing. It's that kind of like focus, right? So anything that's a distraction outside of that.

VISUAL: Tempo necessário para retomar foco após distração, conceito de flow

 

[1:06:30] So just really interesting, guys. I want everyone to take a look at this, right? Everyone take a look at this. It takes people on average 20 minutes to refocus. This is according to Mark Sanborn. If you Google Mark Sanborn, he's one of the top authors in the world, right? For leadership stuff and even time management stuff.

 

[1:06:55] It takes people on average, so once you get distracted, right? Once you check your phone, it takes your brain about 20 minutes to refocus. It's like scientifically proven, right? When I mean refocus, I mean like really get back into what you're doing.

 

[1:07:15] Like, of course, you can multitask. You can switch from Slack to email to whatever. But to really get into the flow, yeah, Bo, flow, it really takes 20 minutes. When you watch Ip Man, William, that's, yeah. I mean, if I'm focusing on Ip Man, then anything else is a distraction. You're right.

 

[1:07:40] But again, here's the key though. You could get distracted again within 20 minutes. And you could be distracted again and again. So imagine this, right? Your whole day, you get like a distraction. And then within 20 minutes, you get another distraction. And you get another distraction. And you get another and another and another and another.

 

[1:08:05] Then your whole day is basically just distracted. You never really 100% focus on what you're doing that day. And then when people, when you ask yourself at the end of the day, like, did I complete the six to eight priorities that I really had to do? Get done today? Did you really do it?

 

[1:08:30] Well, probably not, right? Or not well, not well at all. So that's really what it is, right? I like that low-income distraction, yeah.

NÚMEROS: Não especificado

 

VISUAL: Concentração em uma única tarefa por bloco de tempo

 

[1:08:50] So part of time blocking, focus on just one thing during the time block. Just literally the easiest thing, it's easy to say, hard to do. Your calendar, when you block it out, just one thing.

 

[1:09:10] So I think Felix and Christy, you guys can kind of share a little bit about what you're doing in your time block. Like when I message you and stuff, like how do you kind of ignore me and kind of get back to me later? Felix or Christy? Like share with us, like what are some of your time blocks?

 

[1:09:30] I can say every time that I get a message from you and I'm like in a meeting or something, I just make sure I just minimize Slack. Like if I don't need Slack, I minimize it because even though it still like highlights, that's a lot less than having it full screen as well. So that's one thing that I do.

 

[1:09:55] The other thing that of course that I will just end up doing is if I'm in a meeting and of course they're not sharing something on their screen that I need to pay attention to, I'll actually look away from my monitor because then nothing on my monitor can distract me, pop-ups, nothing.

VISUAL: Ambiente físico limpo, sem objetos distrativos na mesa

 

[1:10:20] Yeah, so for me, in terms of time management, I think for distraction-wise, the way I see distraction is anything that I can see physically in front of me, right? That doesn't mean that it's only phone, like you don't have to necessarily look in your phone to be distracted.

 

[1:10:45] If your phone is in front of you, it's already a distraction in my definition because you have a tendency of like, oh, wait, the phone is in front of me, I want to go check it. So the very key thing here for me is how do I keep my environment as clean as possible, including the things on my table, right?

 

[1:11:10] Who has a lot of junk, like a lot of like random books, like random things on the table here? Put it in the chat. You might have a little like, you know, fancy thing or books or like a laptop or your game console, right?

 

[1:11:30] If you have that, it's already a distraction if you think about it because you see it, your subconscious go like, oh, wait, they want to pick it up, like it's that easy to be distracted. So when I work, when I want zero distractions, on top of what Joel and Christy already mentioned, right, turn off all the notifications and all that stuff, I will also make sure I'm in a very clean environment, that there are zero distractions now that I'm focusing on exactly what I'm doing.

 

[1:12:05] So that's what I would want to add onto distractions. And in terms of time blocking, we have a slide, you know, over on that particular, the power of time blocking, but essentially...

 

[1:12:20] Mentally, I know I have to stop at a certain point, but I would expect I might go over a little bit. So, for example, what I would do for a one-hour task, I would actually put it at 45 minutes. And I won't start my next task until the next hour.

 

[1:12:45] So I get that 15 minutes buffer for myself. Maybe I need to go for a drink. Maybe I need to, you know, take a bathroom break. Then I have that time frame that I know that I could take a little rest, right? Otherwise, it's like you're doing task over task over task before you know it, you're burnt out.

 

[1:13:10] That's what happened to me. So I've been adjusting and reflecting on my time blocking. That helps me a lot through doing this.

VISUAL: Mais tempo para família, amigos, vida pessoal através de time blocking

 

[1:13:30] Yeah, and that's great. That's a great, extremely important point. I think one very important thing I want to bring up, I want to ask everyone a question, right? Why is this so beneficial not just for work? Think of it, think of it outside the box.

 

[1:13:50] Like, how else is this? Why is this so important? Why is time blocking something that could be so beneficial in many parts of your life? Can you actually point out a few things? Because I think that's something really important here I want you guys to think about, right?

 

[1:14:10] Self-awareness, how we do anything, how we do everything, self-management. Oh yeah, I think Aaron's really got it. I think Aaron's really got it. I found that when I time block versus when I never time block, I had more time for myself and my friends and my family.

 

[1:14:35] Like here, one more time. I had more time producing the same, if not even more, results and yet had more time to play, to have fun, right? So when you think about people like, oh, you know, we're working so hard. Like, man, I'm working 16 hours a day. I don't got time for my family, all that kind of stuff.

 

[1:15:00] That's really bullshit. Like, I'm just straight up honest, like that's bullshit, right? Like, you don't work 16 hours straight. You're telling me 16 hours you're working every single second, minute? I can't buy that, man. Like, I just don't believe that, right? That's not humanly possible, right?

 

[1:15:25] Maybe out of the 16 hours, maybe you spent like, I don't know, like eight, nine actual good hours, maybe last six, maybe? The rest of it is just distractions and walking around, like all that stuff, right? It's like, so, you know, people can say they don't have time.

 

[1:15:45] If you're not respecting a time block, that's what it is. That's what it is. So like for now, me right now, not to brag, like I need to, but it's like what I do in four to five hours, I think can, like, you know, Stephen say what he does in like two, three hours, what most people do in like a week, which is so true.

 

[1:16:10] Like for me, it's like what I do in four or five hours could be what most people do in like a day or two days, right? Like I get to a point where I'm so productive. So like I could have the rest of my day pretty much free.

 

[1:16:30] And you know what? It makes my family happier. It makes my life happier. It makes everyone happier, right? Then I don't come to work thinking like, oh my God, I hate work, you know, I work too much, I'm overworked, blah, blah, blah. Like, no, none of that, right? It's because of time blocking. Time blocking gave me back more time. That's really what it is, right?

 

[1:16:55] So I think that's a really key part to this as well.

[1:17:10] So really simple. How can you make this work really well? And then Felix, Christy, just chime in if you need to or just comment in the chat so I know. And then, yeah, we can let you know, just chime in.

 

[1:17:30] Really, it's hard to start at first. I think Bo said she took about five months to even get really good at this. I think I know Felix quite a bit as well. But you really need a lot of discipline, right? Really a lot of discipline, self-management to get to do this, right?

 

[1:17:50] And like I said earlier, set boundaries and expectations for friends and family. They've got to know what you're doing. They've got to respect it as much as you've got to respect that you're doing and you've got to let them know, right? So they know.

 

[1:18:10] You know, this is where the closed-door policy is important. Like, yeah, I like the whole open-door policy thing, which is fine. Obviously, you want people to speak to you, but like, you've got an open door to a point where you're only open door when it's open-door hours.

 

[1:18:30] Like, it's open office hours when it's open office hours. It's not open door 24-7, right? Because that's not how we're going to operate, right? So it's really closed door until you actually dedicate a time for those open office hours. That's really what it is, if you actually choose to do that.

VISUAL: Disciplina em time blocking permite saber quanto tempo tarefas levam

 

[1:18:55] And then Felix, I think this last point is yours, right? When you get more discipline in time blocking, you know how much time it takes for you to complete new tasks, to get on new tasks, right, Felix?

 

[1:19:10] Yep, that's exactly. So another benefit that when it comes to time blocking is really when you're so good at it, when you're so disciplined, when you're so, like, we don't want just clarity. We want, like, extreme clarity on our schedule so that we can confidently say that, hey, you know what? I know I have these party tasks I have to do. That's why I can only do this.

 

[1:19:40] So you can say no or yes to new projects when you know that, hey, I can actually do this. I cannot. But without time blocking, without being really good at estimating how much time you need to complete a task, then you might over, you know, you might burn yourself out by accepting too many projects or you are not accepting many projects that you need in order to get the productive that you need.

 

[1:20:10] So think about how time blocking can help you. That is a side effect that I found myself is I'm now very easy to tell people, okay, I can't do this until Wednesday or next week. I can confidently say that, like, because that literally is what I do on my time blocking. I can really see. So, Christy?

 

[1:20:35] Yeah, I kind of want to add a little bit to this that, you know, I like to think that right now, and I'm changing this, but I'm in a very unique situation, okay? Some of you that actually know me, and maybe you can relate to this, right, is that I have a mother who thinks that she is kind of above the rules, right?

 

[1:21:00] Maybe you have that person that's like, you know, what do you mean that there's time blocking? What do you mean I got to schedule this in? I should be able to just do it whenever because you're home, right? So I just want to add a little bit here that when it comes to your family members as well, I always try to reason with them first, try to close them, you know, this is why, you know, can you be supportive, you know, you know, I'm going to dedicate time just for you.

 

[1:21:35] That way you still feel entitled to it. You still have that time you can look forward to it. But if for any reason that they are maybe non-supportive, you know, we're closers, right? We're not the people that are pushy, keep trying to change their mind if they don't want to, which is why I'm also changing my environment so then that way I'm also lowering distractions, which at this point also includes my family, to giving that extra space so then they have to respect my time because now I'm not just like in the next room.

[1:22:45] Like, there's a bunch, but put in Discord. What stands for MVP? To you? Yeah, most valuable player. Yeah, hell yeah. I want to be an MVP, right? Yeah, minimum viable product. For those of you in tech and software, yep, minimum viable product, most valuable, yep, yep.

 

[1:23:10] Love it, love it, love it, love it. Okay, great. So most valuable person, yep. Now let me share another definition of MVP when it comes to time management or self-management or time blocking. Are you ready for it? There's another beautiful acronym for MVP, okay?

 

[1:23:35] Here we go. Most valuable and profitable activities. So write that down, right? Your most valuable and profitable activities. That's MVP right now. My valuable pony, yeah, that's because Christy loves that show. That's funny.

 

[1:24:00] But the most valuable profitable activity, right? So really, you want to focus on accomplishing the six to eight things in a day, right, that can generate the highest returns on your time investment, right? Which is what Sifu talks about, right? Roti.

 

[1:24:25] So six to eight things that generate the highest returns on your time invested. And really, 60 to 80% of your day should be spent on MVP activities. So that's the way to look at it. So if you look at the time block sheet that Christy so kindly helped us make, which is there, if you put 60 to 80% of your time in...

 

[1:24:50] ...MVP activities, that's where you're going to get the most results, the most revenue, the most productivity, right? So that's the key.

I know I never want to be a jerk like that guy. I don't want to be a jackass like that person. And I don't want to be that like, so it's great.

[1:26:25] Some of you have seen this before. It's called the Eisenhower Decision Matrix. Most of you, I think some of you have seen this for sure. For sure, for sure. Yeah. So if you look at the X and the Y axis, right? You know what's the urgent, not urgent versus not important, important.

 

[1:26:50] And I think, yeah, CIT, I probably talked about this long, like quite a few months ago in CIT. Yeah, for sure. So quadrant one, what's urgent and important? Quadrant two, not urgent, but important. Quadrant three, urgent, not important. And then quadrant four, right? Not urgent, not important.

 

[1:27:15] But we're also going to give you some examples of what it's like as a salesperson, right? Some activities, what would you classify? So really for sure, like let's talk about it a little bit, right? Like first of all, can someone define the difference between urgent and important in this course?

 

[1:27:40] Because first we need to define, because some people say, I mean like urgent and important, it's about the same thing, isn't it? Like define that. Right? Like try to define that, right? What if urgent is not always important?

 

[1:28:00] Okay, okay. I kind of see someone, yeah, someone. Okay, okay. Interesting. Everyone has different definitions, right? So I like to define it, something urgent is something that means a task requires immediate attention.

[1:28:25] So like to me, if something is urgent, like it's got to be attended to, you know what I mean? Like if it's urgent, someone's got to take care of it because it's urgent. Like we got to take care of it like now. Like it's like now, it's like a now kind of thing, right? That's like urgent tasks basically make us reactive.

 

[1:28:50] So think of it, urgent is you get defensive or negative or hurried. You can get very narrowly focused, right? So you get really rushed. You get really rushed. It's urgent, right? And then important things are more long term, right? Long term mission values, goal, long term things, right?

 

[1:29:15] So I would say, you know, easy way to define it would be one is like now, one's like long term, okay? So if you think about it, what's urgent and important, right? This means something that's really important. I got to do it now, plus it's really important.

 

[1:29:35] Not urgent but important means this is more long term, right? Quadrant two. It's not really urgent. Don't do it now, but it would be good for my long term success. And we'll talk about some examples soon.

 

[1:29:55] Urgent, not important. This is like, I got to do it now, but am I the right person? Like, okay, we got to do it now, but am I the right person to take care of this, right? Or can someone else take care of it? This one is just like not urgent, not important, right?

[1:30:40] So I think, Bogdan, just now you asked what some examples are, like how do you classify it? So I would put it in these kind of examples, right? So David, I'm going to help you understand that in a little bit as well. So let's look at some examples. I'll do some examples. That will make the most sense.

 

[1:31:00] What is important and urgent? Meaning like I've got to take care of it now, right? So that's like a code red, emergency. Okay, like you're in class right now, right? I think someone said it. Is this class important to you? Yes or no? So would you say this class is what? What quadrant would it be?

 

[1:31:25] Right? Like would it be quadrant one or two for you? One. Yeah, one. Okay, for some of you it's one. Yeah, some of you it's one. Okay, great. Now, but let me ask you this. Let's say a fire breaks out like right outside your bedroom or in your room. What would you, like what's urgent at that time, right?

 

[1:31:50] Like this class will no longer become quadrant one, right? The fire is literally quadrant one. So you've got to get out of the fire. It's a code red. You've got to move. All right, so you run. You get out. You're not going to sit in class and just burn, right? Die burning, listening to the class, right?

 

[1:32:15] I hope none of you would do that. I mean, that would be pretty impressive, but I hope none of you do that, right? Like that's a bit too much. Yeah, follow Felix, right? Don't follow me. Right? So like crisis, deadline problems.

Those take time, don't they? They take long term, right? Planning, right? Planning a vacation. Yeah, that takes some time.

 

[1:33:25] Like it's important, but it's not like right now, right now, right? So those things I plan, right? I plan. Okay?

[1:33:45] Not urgent but important. Now, quadrant three, as you can see here, delegate. But these are things like they are not important, but they're urgent, right? This one, this is a bit confusing. Some people get confused by this because it's like, wait, if something is not important, but it's urgent, how does it even make sense? How is it possible?

 

[1:34:10] Well, a great example would be like, you know, interruption, right? Let's say you're in, yeah, you know, let's say the mailman came to the door and he, okay, very perfect example. The mailman came to your door and he needs a signature of delivery, right? He needs you to sign, but you're doing something that's important.

 

[1:34:35] You don't want to leave, so you get your sibling or your husband or your wife or your daughter or your son to go sign it, right? Delegation, right there. Like, wouldn't you agree it's pretty urgent that the mailman's at your door? The mailman, the postman needs you to sign. Someone needs to sign it.

 

[1:35:00] But obviously, it's not important to you, so you can get your family members to go and sign it. So you delegate, right? That's an example of quadrant three.

[1:35:20] Okay, so can I get everyone to confirm quadrant one, two, and three? You guys clear on that? You guys get the distinction, right? Because it's really important to get the differences.

 

[1:35:40] Yeah, and then quadrant four is, you know, this is like not important, not urgent, right? You can see it's eliminate. So just get rid of them, right? Don't just get rid of them. Time wasters, pleasant activity, trivia.

[1:36:05] You know, I mean, eliminate or limit. I would say this is a very harsh word. I would prefer the word limit. So instead of eliminate, maybe limit, right? Limit yourself because you got to have fun sometimes. And that's not all the times, right?

 

[1:36:30] So then, you know, very simple. All the activities you do, you know how like I said in the beginning a couple slides ago, you know, go and do the whole like every couple minutes write down what you're doing, right? When you write it down, put all of the stuff you do 24 hours, 48 hours in the quadrants, right?

 

[1:36:55] All your time blocks, put it in the quadrants. Everything, everything. So Felix, Christy, give me some of your tasks as a sales manager. Give me some examples. Like update HubSpot, like stuff like that. Throw some names out there.

 

[1:37:15] Reporting. Sorry, recording? Reporting? Reporting, yeah. Metric reporting. Okay, be more specific to me, to Sifu, to the team or what? Metric reporting to Joel, to you. So is that a HubSpot report? Yep, HubSpot report.

 

[1:37:40] Okay, so what quadrant is that for you, Christy? For me, it would probably be quadrant two because it's not urgent because I can plan it, but it is important because it's important to figure out exactly where the team stands. Plus it helps Joel to also manage Sifu's expectations.

 

[1:38:05] Yeah, fantastic. Exactly, right? So Christy plans for that and she plans the time or she either plans it out and then she submits them. Beautiful. Felix, give me some of your activities as a sales manager.

[1:39:00] After that, you guys kind of know my story. I joined the army and then I did also computer science and then yeah, and then HCC. But yeah, so I switched from meds into communication.

 

[1:39:20] But what I wanted to say now is, you know, like, I no longer look down on communication as what it was, as sort of an easy major to get an A with because I know like even in university, it is still pretty easy. I know a lot of students in communication majors, like they get through really easily.

 

[1:39:45] But there's a lot of benefits, really a lot of benefits to being a good communicator. That's the point. The point I'm trying to make is like, you can make a lot of freaking money just being a freaking good communicator. Like just like closing, right? You flap your lips, you flap your tongue to get sales. That's literally what it is.

 

[1:40:10] So like, I know I'm thankful. I'm really thankful for communication. That's really good. Anyways, let's move on to communication key number one. I think that one, I think some of this is, you guys kind of notice, like maybe common sense, so you've experienced this in work.

 

[1:40:35] But we kind of want to break it down in kind of detail, right? With Felix and Christy.

VISUAL: Importância de metas claras e específicas vs vagas

 

[1:40:50] So this one is very simple. Clearly articulate and define team goals and expectation. This is part of brilliant communication as an elite manager. Okay, so let's see. Can someone tell me why this is bad?

 

[1:41:10] Hey, Felix, Christy, we've got to do so much better in sales revenue compared to last month. Why is this bad? Someone just tell me, right? Oh, the reason why it's bad. Not specific. Yep, that's one. Top down. Yep. Vague.

 

[1:41:35] Yeah, so vague, right? It's like, what does so much better mean? Dude, like what does that mean, right? Is $1 better? Is $2 better? $10? $100? Like $1,000? $1,000,000? What do you mean, right?

 

[1:41:55] And then like last month, like okay, like last month, like the whole month? You mean like the last four weeks? Do you mean like, you know, like front end revenue, back end revenue? Are you talking about total revenue? Are you talking about like is it actual revenue or is it deferred revenue, right? Is it collectible? Like what is it, right?

 

[1:42:20] So yeah, you guys can kind of see. So can you imagine as a manager, if you say this to the closers, like let's say you're a closer, right? And your manager says this to you, what would you say to your manager?

 

[1:42:40] Like you're the closer, right? And then maybe Christy or Felix, just say this to them, to Discord. What do you, so if anyone, Felix, Christy, you guys there? Just repeat the quote and then get Discord to respond. I want to see what they respond. Just say this to Discord. Imagine they're a team of closers.

 

[1:43:05] All right, team. So we've got to do much better in sales revenue compared to last month. Yeah. And so William's like, well, what do you mean, Christy? It was much better. What the fuck do we do about it, Aaron? Like, well, huh? Q's like, huh? Zachary's like, what do you mean? Patrick's like, okay, cool.

 

[1:43:30] And to be honest, like, you know, we can be guilty of it too. Some of us would probably be like, yeah, Christy, whatever. I got it. Sure, sure. And then like, you know, it kind of goes in one ear, goes out the other ear. It's gonna probably, most people will be like that, right?

 

[1:43:50] They're probably not gonna be like, what, Christy? Most people will just be like, oh, whatever, fuck it. Like, goes in one ear and goes out the other ear. I don't care.

VISUAL: Comunicação clara com números específicos, consequências e recompensas

 

[1:44:10] So let's see how can Christy improve this, right? So Christy, let's repeat this one. You guys say, oh, wow, it's a lot more. All right, guys. So for the month of August, our collective team target is to hit 300,000 in sales.

 

[1:44:35] Now, with six closers, this translates to individual sales targets of 50,000 per closer. If you don't achieve the $50,000 target, and this has been the third month in a row, you will be removed from the team.

 

[1:45:00] Now, if you achieve the 100,000 in sales revenue, you'll actually be receiving a nice bonus. And so, of course, it's not perfect, but it's definitely better. So can you tell me why is it better?

 

[1:45:20] So someone said it's clear. Karen and Zachary got it, right? You got the carrot and stick in there. You got the bonus, yeah. Clarification targets, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I love it, yeah.

 

[1:45:40] How could you make this a bit better than what it is right now? You can still make this a lot better, actually, a lot better, not a bit better. You can still make it a lot better, right? The bonus is not clear, yep, yep, I agree. That's one.

 

[1:46:00] Yeah, I love it. Aaron hit the next point, actually. What's the why? Yeah, we're gonna cover that. Timeline, yep. Is it August 1st to 31st, you know? Yeah, so yeah, exactly, right? So those are some things we can improve for sure.

 

[1:46:25] Yeah, but you can see, like, by the way, like, just think about it, right? How much time does it take someone to write or say this first one? Like, how fast can you say or write this out in text? It's pretty fast. I mean, like, what, 30 seconds or less? Two seconds? Yeah.

 

[1:46:50] I mean, for this, don't you agree you gotta put a bit more thought into it? Like, if you wanna make it super, like, accurate, you've gotta spend more time, right? It's not gonna be a couple seconds to write this whole thing out. You gotta actually think about it, right?

 

[1:47:10] What's the bonus? What's the time frame? What's the number? So if you can see, communication is hard work, guys. Like, I don't wanna, I wanna make the point. My first point is to actually show you that communicating takes a lot of fucking work. It's tiring. Like, it takes effort. It's hard.

 

[1:47:35] It's, like, sometimes you just feel, I don't wanna say so much or say it, but, like, you've got, like, it's so important. It's so crucial, right? It's just, yeah, it's what it is.

[1:47:55] Like, let's look at this, right? Study in Stanford, right? Stanford graduate student had to prove how this is done, right? So look at this. You have to over-communicate just to communicate.

 

[1:48:15] Like, this, I wanna make this a key for everyone tonight. Whatever you do moving forward, always remember you have to over-communicate. The one thing, like, again, one thing to take away too is just don't be sloppy. Don't be lazy. Always over-communicate.

 

[1:48:40] And you can read the study, right? The Tapless and the Listener study. Guess what song was being tapped, right? You can see over-communication improved, obviously improved the results, right? And it's just like, it's just it.

 

[1:49:00] Yeah, so you're not a delusional Jacob. You've gotta spend so much more energy and time communicating. Because it's so easy to tell Christy and Felix, hey, Christy, Felix, we need five mil in August. All right, good. No questions. Bye. Done. All right, see you on August 31st, guys. Bye, ciao. Right?

 

[1:49:25] Isn't it super simple to say that? Like, it's just like, wow, I'm just saying it. I'm done. I communicated. Well, I communicated to you, right? I communicated to you. I did that. I sent it. You know, I recorded my call. I said the five seconds. I said two seconds, right?

 

[1:49:50] But versus, you know, taking time to have communication back and forth, answer their question, be more clear, be more specific, talk about what happens if they don't open it. Like, that's a whole different conversation right there. Yeah, then they shit their pants. Yeah, exactly. Exactly, right?

[1:50:20] So, I think Aaron, you kind of hit this one. Maybe Felix, you want to say this quote or say the wrong one? All right, Joel, I need you to provide a list of objections that you're facing out in the field.

 

[1:50:45] Yeah, and I love this one because I really got this really hammered into me in the army. Because even though, like, I don't know, like, how many of you guys actually are vets or are in the military or have served in the military? I think you guys know what I'm talking about. Whatever military. It doesn't have to be US military or whatever military, right?

 

[1:51:10] Yeah, fantastic. So, you know, like, we've got privates, right? Like, we've got privates and, you know, I mean, it's just what it is. Like, some people just look down on privates because they're younger, immature, less experience, right? Not always, but they tend to be a bit slower, right? A bit.

 

[1:51:35] And like, sometimes you just get frustrated. You're like, I don't really want to explain why to all the privates. Like, do the privates really need to know why we're doing this mission? But, you know, as a lieutenant, as a commissioned officer, like, yeah, we find...

 

[1:52:00] Why, right? We're not going to get into issues if we do that. Yep, sure. Oh, no, no, no. You know, I didn't say that. I mean, let's do it this way, right? I do that all the time. Here's the thing, right? Here's how I look at it.

 

[1:52:25] It's always better to clarify before executing than executing and then messing it up, right? To me, it depends on the situation. Of course, sometimes you have moments where you want to shoot first and ask for forgiveness later. Have you guys heard about that? That's a famous saying.

 

[1:52:50] Sometimes you make a mistake and then you ask for, you say sorry later, right? You ask for forgiveness later. But most times in a company, sometimes we can't afford to make a big mistake, you know what I'm saying? Like, I can't afford to fuck up the sales for one whole funnel, right? For one day.

 

[1:53:15] So I prefer to get it right the first time and then go do it properly. So it really depends on the situation, right? It really does, right? So that's kind of the whole management thing that you've got to manage up.

 

[1:53:35] Always easier to ask for forgiveness. Yeah, but sometimes it goes the other way around too, depending on the situation, right? If it's going to cost a company, you know, $10 million, if I make that decision, you bet I better ask for permission first and ask for forgiveness, yeah?

 

[1:54:00] You know, like it just depends what my action is going to cost the company, right? So if I do it wrong, right? So that's kind of how I look at it. Okay.

NÚMEROS: 3 formas diferentes

 

VISUAL: Visual, Auditivo, Cinestésico - cobrir todos os estilos de aprendizado

 

[1:54:20] And this one maybe Felix or Christy, you guys want to take this? Okay. So in terms of communications, like this is something that I learned from Joe actually. It's actually very profound when you get this. You will see the importance of over communicating. That's how I see it, right?

 

[1:54:50] Before I know about this, all I think about is like, all right, as long as I make it really clear in one meeting and I'm just going to say this once very clearly, then the team would get it. In fact, that's not the case, right?

 

[1:55:10] There are each of individuals, they are more receptive of information based on a different form of communications. So you have visual, you have like sign kinesthetic or auditory, right? From listening.

 

[1:55:30] So when it comes to thinking of ways of communicating, you have to do it multiple ways. So let's say I wanted to show the team how they are supposed to follow an instruction in order to get their sales properly tracked, right?

 

[1:55:55] One, I would do it three different forms. One, I would do write it down in an SOP, right? In a text form, they can read it like for visual, right? And then once I do that, I'll announce it to the team in a Slack, which is also our text messaging platform. That's one form.

 

[1:56:20] Now, is that enough? In fact, it's not enough. It's communicated once. Now, how do we do over communication? The second way, what I do is I'll bring up to the team meeting. I'll screen share the SOP and actually go through that all auditory, like through speaking. So I'm going to read through the SOP really clearly with the team. That's the second way, right?

 

[1:56:50] Third way, if I were to do the whole package of the whole thing is I'm actually going to follow the SOP in front of them and doing that exactly right in front of them, right? So now we covered all three aspects of communications and this would ensure that your team would be 100% clear.

 

[1:57:15] But if you miss one of them, then it's likely that maybe some individuals, because they just accept, they just receive information much better on one way. You just miss that way, then they might not clearly get that.

 

[1:57:35] And I got this from Joe and ever since I learned this concept, I've been always doing my best to really do all three forms of communications. And then, yeah, you go to Aaron's house in Seattle and you show him how to do on his computer, right? That's funny.

 

[1:58:00] Yeah, so this one is just really key. I mean, how many of you guys are more visual, right? Like who's visual, who's kinesthetic, who's auditory? Like put it in the chat, right? Which one are you?

 

[1:58:20] I'm definitely more auditory myself. I don't know. I love listening instead of like reading or doing it. But yeah, everyone's different. Exactly. See, the point is everyone's different, right? Everyone's different.

 

[1:58:40] Daniel, if you're not sure, you can just figure out by like in the future, you get a friend or get someone like a role play, brother, sister, let them give you a set of directions, create a set of directions, get one of them to send it to you through text, one of them to say it to you, one of them to like, I don't know, walk you through on Zoom or something in person, right?

 

[1:59:10] And then see which one you get faster and better and more accurate with less mistakes. You can figure out that way for sure. Like in a role play or something, right? That's a way to do it, to figure out what works best for you.

 

[1:59:30] But yeah, I mean, the bottom line is everyone's different and then the more ways you can hit, it covers most people. So like Felix said, right? It's great. You can have a meeting on Zoom, you can talk about it, but then you can also share your screen and then walk through on HubSpot or the CRM how to actually do it and then get everyone to follow you how to do it and then get them to share their screen to see how to do it.

 

[2:00:00] Or and then you just go on text, right? Put the whole instruction in Slack or put it on the intranet site. They can read it. Done. So it's three different things. So I love to hit basically hit it all in three different ways.

[2:00:25] And then here we go. So I like the PIP approach. There's another tactic and actually, if you guys realize, right? I think someone said PIP earlier today, but it's the whole purpose importance preview approach.

 

[2:00:45] I know we learned this in communication quite a bit, but I actually did it earlier tonight. If you guys remember, I stated the purpose of the presentation and then I shared why the presentation is important to you tonight, right?

 

[2:01:05] And then I reviewed the implications of what happens if you don't take this and then what are the outcomes of you getting tonight's presentation, tonight's class, right? So I purposely did that to show you, to demonstrate PIP, right?

 

[2:01:25] Because you guys can clearly see in the beginning of class tonight, we did this, right? We did the setting agenda. So we did the whole thing, just showing you the PIP approach now. And then I gave you the topics that will be discussed, right?

 

[2:01:45] So this is something we learned in communication and it works pretty well. It gets people engaged in the beginning too, right? You can keep them in the class and all that, which is really key. All right.

[2:02:10] So we've got a quick little role play with the managers and the directors. Well, myself really, not directors, myself. But this one is really, really big. I want you guys to really pay attention to this because this is the thing that I talked about in the beginning that really grinded my gears as a director.

 

[2:02:35] When a manager just copies and pastes my message to the closers when it wasn't supposed to go out to everyone. I know some of you, how many of you experienced that before in your management experience, right?

 

[2:02:55] You tell someone something and you want them to tell it to everyone. But some information should not be like public or to go to everyone, but then they told everyone and then it made everyone confused or it made everyone demotivated. It made everyone like maybe shiny object syndrome too excited, right? It just messed everything up. It just fucked everything up.

 

[2:03:20] So this one is really big. I know a lot of people, like personally, I've seen our week at this, really got to improve on this. You really got to know what to say, what not to say to certain type of people.

 

[2:03:40] So it's like the whole managing up and down, like you really know what, you need to know what to say to some people, what not to say, right? Don't just say everything because you're going to piss some people off all the time.

 

[2:04:00] So we're going to do the scenario, myself and Felix and Christy. I am obviously the director of sales and then Felix is the sales manager. And then Christy and the team of closers are just closers, right? Christy's under Felix's team.

 

[2:04:20] Yeah, exactly. Phillip, that's exactly a problem. Exactly. So Felix, are you ready? Let's do it. All right, so the scenario is this. Felix is in the office and I saw Felix and I say, okay, hey Felix, you got like 10 minutes. I got a really important or really urgent situation I got to talk to you about.

 

[2:04:45] Okay, what's happened, Joel? All right, come to my office really quick. I want to close the door because I want this to just go to you first, okay? Just to you. I don't want to let this out the room right now, okay? So let's close the door.

 

[2:05:05] So Felix, here's what I got, okay? I just spoke to the executive team and actually the finance department just shared our finances for the month of July. As you know, back since March, especially after COVID hit, our company's revenue has gone down in April, May, June, right? Quite significantly.

 

[2:05:30] You probably, you were at the team meetings, right? Felix, you saw the numbers? Yeah, I do. We went down from like...

[2:05:35] We went down from like $3 million a month to like $1 million a month, right? Pretty significant drop. And you know, obviously it's affected the whole company, right? So here's what I got to tell you, Felix.

 

[2:06:00] The executive team just told me that we need to let go of some people on the team. We need to cut costs. And unfortunately, we're going to have to let go of about three closers from your team. And I need you to figure out which three closers we're going to let go.

[2:06:30] Now, Felix, I want you to think about this. Don't tell the team yet. I want you to think about it over the weekend. Come back to me on Monday with your recommendations. But I need you to be very strategic about this. Think about performance, think about potential, think about culture fit, right?

 

[2:07:00] And Felix, this is confidential. I don't want this getting out to the team until we've made our final decision. Can you do that for me? Yeah, absolutely, Joel. I understand. This is a tough situation, but I'll think about it over the weekend and get back to you on Monday with my recommendations.

 

[2:07:25] Perfect. Now, here's the wrong way to do it, right? Let me show you the wrong way. So imagine Felix leaves my office and he's like, oh man, this is heavy news. This is tough news. And he goes straight to the team Slack channel and he's just like...

 

[2:07:50] Hey team, just had a meeting with Joel. Company revenue is down from $3 million to $1 million. We need to let go of three closers. I need to figure out who. Will let you know Monday. And he just copy-pastes that to the whole team.

[2:08:50] Everyone's scared. Everyone's updating their resumes. Everyone's looking for new jobs. The morale is completely destroyed, right? And guess what? The performance for the next three days, four days is going to be shit. Nobody's going to close anything because everyone's worried about their job.

 

[2:09:15] And then Monday comes and Felix comes back to me and says, Joel, nobody closed anything this weekend. The team's performance is terrible. I'm like, well, what happened? And then I find out, oh, you told the whole team. Like, dude, I told you not to tell anyone.

 

[2:09:40] So that's the wrong way, right? That's the copy-paste manager. That's the manager who doesn't filter information. That's the manager who doesn't think about what to say, what not to say, when to say it, how to say it, right?

[2:10:05] So the right way would be Felix leaves my office, he thinks about it over the weekend. He doesn't tell anyone. He comes back Monday with his recommendations. We discuss it. We make the final decision. And then Felix and I together, we communicate to the team in a very strategic way.

 

[2:10:35] We don't say, hey, we're firing three people. We say, hey team, we're going through some restructuring. We're making some changes to optimize the team. And unfortunately, we're going to have to let some people go. But for those of you who are staying, here's what we're going to do to support you. Here's how we're going to help you succeed, right?

 

[2:11:05] So that's the difference between a good manager and a bad manager. A good manager filters information. A good manager thinks strategically about what to communicate, when to communicate, how to communicate, right?

 

[2:11:30] And this applies to everything, not just layoffs. This applies to new products, new launches, new strategies, new goals, everything. You've got to filter information. You've got to be strategic about communication.

[2:11:55] It really make me think and really make me sweat. And I should go, wow, Felix, that's a freaking good question, right? Because if you ask me a question and I can respond and I can answer it in one second, it means you haven't thought deep enough.

 

[2:12:20] It means you haven't been resourceful enough, right? And essentially, you could be wasting my time. So I always challenge the managers that before they ask me a question, they got to make sure the question can make me sweat and the question can make me really go, wow, I do not know the answer to that, but I'll get back to you both.

 

[2:12:45] Like, that's a fucking good question. So Felix and Christy are really good with that. They're really good at it. So my team's, I'm very proud of my team. They're extremely effective.

 

[2:13:05] If you look at our management chat, they only ask me questions that they know they cannot answer. No one can answer. And I know I can't answer either, right? They ask me like really like high quality questions.

 

[2:13:25] And the same thing for the closers too, I'm sure with them and the team, right? Because they know I get frustrated when they ask me a very simple question. I was like, have you been resourceful? Did you Google it, right?

[2:14:10] So, you know, and again, like I don't ask Felix and Christy, oh, by the way, Felix and Christy, I want to micromanage you guys. So just tell me every single thing you do on a daily basis. Tell me every single thing your closers do. I don't say any of that, right? Like I don't care about that.

 

[2:14:35] So they know they don't have to tell me every single thing that they're doing or that the team's doing. In fact, it's funny. In my department, and I don't know about the other departments, like I noticed Dan is here with support, community, right?

[2:26:10] And by the way, we've got some closers on our team too. I think Christy and Felix, we both got, you both got closer A and B type people on your team, right? I don't know whether you're going to name their names or not, but you can if you want to, you know, call them out if you want.

 

[2:26:35] That's great, let's maintain it, right? Maintain is another goal, okay? So however, what HubSpot recommends is that you focus on one thing at a time. So this is good for them to brainstorm, right?

[2:27:05] You can ask your closer yourself, you can write down as many goals as you want. Write down as many, five, 10, whatever. But HubSpot's gonna say just choose one first. You don't wanna work on five things at one time, work on one, get good at one first, right? So work on one.

 

[2:27:30] So the reality right now is we pick one, we pick the conversion rates. And then I asked her, okay, so let's talk about reality. Where are you today versus where you wanna be? So today, you are at 17% conversion rate. You wanna get to 21%.

 

[2:28:00] Let me ask you this first question. In two weeks, can you realistically see yourself getting 5% increase? And I asked her, I don't make the decision for her. I don't say, I think you can, I think you can't. She tells me, I ask her for permission.

 

[2:28:25] She says, yeah, it's doable, 5%. I mean, it's high, but I can do it. I say, great. I like your confidence and that's why I'm here to help you get there. Whatever it takes to support you to get there. So I said, okay.

 

[2:28:50] She definitely feels like she can improve her closing skills. Can still further improve the ability to convert over the phone. This is 30 days, my bad, 30 days. But we said, realistically going 30 days, right? So it's realistic, 30 days, not 14.

 

[2:29:15] And yeah, basically reality-wise, it's doable. Basically it's doable. More conscientious about it, more active about it, but it's definitely doable.

[2:29:40] Then here's the fun part, the options, right? This is where her and I, we both listed out all the different ideas she could do to improve her conversion rate. Anything you can think about, just list it down. It doesn't matter whether it's bad, it's crazy, it's whatever. Whatever you think about, just put it down.

 

[2:30:10] So you know what? Let's try, let's test more closing techniques. Let's listen to more of the sniper, back in the day, sharpshooters, snipers calls. Let's open up more calendars, calendar time, right? You open up six hours a day, let's open up more. Sure, right? Which we talked about a little bit.

 

[2:30:35] Do more pre-call, pre-call meaning pre-call email, pre-call text message, pre-call FTC, right? Do more of those. Have automated emails that HubSpot set up. And this is cool. Have a personal email with a video of yourself in the email to your prospect, you know, reminding them about their book call. Let's implement that. Let's test it out.

 

[2:31:05] So that was pretty cool, right? So we want to try that. So these are all the options. Obviously, we didn't, option first, we just list all of the ones possible, right?

[2:31:30] And then the last step is basically way forward. Have the salesperson choose one of the options, right? Then your job as a coach, just host them accountable to pursuing that option. That's very simple. So I don't force them to pick it. They choose it themselves.

 

[2:32:00] So she actually chose to work on two things, actually. She actually wanted to improve her conversion rate and also maintain her shop rate, which is fine, right? In 30 days, it's not 14 days, my bad. 30 days, that's actually doable, right? Two things in 30 days, that's fine.

 

[2:32:25] So this is where I held her accountable, right? Every week, every Sunday, she was going to send me whether she listened to three sniper closing calls per week, 12 calls a month, whether she wrote out each call, she wrote out one closing technique.

 

[2:32:50] Like, I'm going to repeat that, guys. She wrote out on paper one closing technique, okay? And I don't know what was interesting. So Sam Hong, Tatiana, this were her accountability partners. These snipers held her accountable to her goal.

 

[2:33:15] And then the personal email thing, at least four personal emails each day for prospects, right? Who holds you accountable? At the time, Sam was the leader, right? So that was kind of why. Yeah, Sam was the leader at that time. So Sam was going to hold her accountable.

 

[2:33:40] Yeah, and that was it. And then every Sunday, she sent me her progress, right? And to Sam and to Tatiana too, right? Did she write out one technique? Did she look at closing calls per week? Did she send out the four emails?

 

[2:34:05] And we just held her accountable. And she actually did improve her conversion rate, not to 21%, but to 25% in 30 days, believe it or not. So it was like a 10% increase doing these things.

[2:35:00] So the key to this really is accountability, really. Because if you think about it, we can talk about all these things. We can talk about all the nice things I'm going to do, you're going to do, right? Like you're going to do all this cool stuff, right? Yeah, sure, you're going to do it.

 

[2:35:25] But like, are they really going to do it? Do you know they're going to do it? It's like trust but verify. You trust they're going to do it, but you've got to verify that they're going to do it. That's why accountability is so key. It's always a trust but verify thing.

 

[2:35:50] Are we getting back accountability? No, that's only in HCC. In IC, you guys, I think you can create your own one. Like you can put all the brothers and sisters here, right? You guys can create all of this together. This was in Christie, actually. This was another closer.

 

[2:36:15] But yeah, that's a good question. But has this kind of helped you a little bit to show you what you could do for coaching yourself on sales? I know it's very simple and it's just on conversion rate and shop rates, but it's something that's really effective, right?

 

[2:36:40] And when you watch the HubSpot module, it goes in depth into how you can actually do this and more ways to do it. So yeah, really highly recommend it.

 

[2:37:00] Whoa, that's like, I don't know where you guys heard that. That's like something fell outside, super loud. Anyways, that's that.

[2:37:50] Yeah, you know, I think Rich can hold that record. I'm not going to break that record tonight. But definitely, we're going to have quite a long class, which is good. Good information, right? It's a good information.

 

[2:38:15] So how many of you like the HubSpot grow sheet and the module? How many of you have liked this thing, right? It's very simple, but it works. Yeah, good. All right. Actually, Felix and Christy, do you have anything on this before we move on?

 

[2:38:40] Nope. Okay. Yes? I heard Felix. Yes. Oh, Christy. Well, no, it's me. It's Christy. So I will say that with the grow sheet in itself, top performers may only list that it's only like 0.5% or 1%.

 

[2:39:10] Or maybe it's not even something relevant to a conversion, but it's like, you know, I want to be better at communicating with pearls. I want to be better at communicating with rubies. Right? Because maybe their closes have been mostly some of the other gems and they're having trouble with some of them.

 

[2:39:35] So that will actually then increase their conversions naturally. So they're not always specifically metrics, although they can also impact their metrics.

 

[2:39:55] Yeah, that's a good point. A cue with asking why. I don't know what she asked why so far. What's the context? Maybe, cue, you want to rephrase your question? We can get back to it.

 

[2:40:15] I just remember, there's a question from Chris Gambrell, like way earlier today, I forgot to answer it, but it was a good question, right? He asked, so I'm going back to the whole manager-leader thing. Sorry, a bit of a tangent here, but he asked, so does it mean to be a manager, you got to be a leader first?

 

[2:40:40] Or like, is it like, what is it? Is it simultaneous, right? Because you'd be both at the same time. Like, what's the progression, right? So here's my answer to that, okay?

VISUAL: Bom líder ≠ necessariamente bom gerente, mas bom gerente = provavelmente bom líder

 

[2:41:05] My answer to that is, it is not a guarantee that you are going to be a good manager just because you are a good leader. However, it is very likely, 99.9% likely, that if you are a good manager, you're also a good leader.

 

[2:41:30] That's why manager comes above leader, right? Like, just because you're a good leader doesn't mean you can be a good manager, though. That's the reality. But if you're a good, remember, managers can choose to lead, right?

 

[2:41:55] But they mainly just create the environment and they follow, but it doesn't mean they cannot lead. And if you think about it, a manager is positional authority. Manager has a title. You don't get a title if you're shit. You don't get a title if you're bad. Your company will give you a title. Someone will give you a title if you're good. Therefore, great.

 

[2:42:25] I know Christy just said they did it for about a month or two months and actually the top closer just ended up winning it every single day, right? Remember Christy? We had one closer who won it like 80% of the month, right? And then it just became like...

 

[2:42:50] Yeah, go ahead. And actually what ended up happening was because of the top performers there and the carrots were so small that actually because the top performers kept winning, even the lower people then got motivated, but even the top performer saw that and on their own, which is why I adore them the greatest, on their own, they stopped coming on purpose and they told me this.

 

[2:43:20] Not that I couldn't be there, but I didn't want to be a part of it so other people can win, so other people can get the carrot.

VISUAL: Problema quando mesmo top performer ganha sempre, desmotivação da equipe

 

[2:43:45] Yeah, and that's great. So just so you get the context, how this worked was Christy and James used to have a daily huddle where if you jump on for that day, you could compete to win a prize.

 

[2:44:10] For example, if you had the most call connected, you had the most sales, you had the most appointment setters, right? If you were there in the huddle, you were in the running for 24 hours to win a small prize. It could be like a $25 gift card, it could be like a, I don't know, like a phone holder, it could be something, it could be some small gift, right?

 

[2:44:40] So what ended up happening, like Christy said, the winner happened to be the top closer for like 80% of the month. The guy, the same person won every time. So in the end, the guy was just like, you know what, I'm not going to show up to this because I want other people to win.

 

[2:45:05] So that's super go-giver, right? Awesome go-giver mentality. But you can also see the other drawback of the carrot too. It does depend on the size. But if the same person keeps winning it, what do you think everyone else feels?

 

[2:45:30] Let's say the same person keeps winning the carrot, right? Day in, day out, the same guy for the past like two years or whatever. Yeah, it's just like, yeah, rigged. And also it's like, what's the point? Like why do I even need to come on these huddles? I'm not going to win anyways. So why do I even bother trying?

 

[2:46:00] Yeah, Edward's got it. Right? It's like, why? So again, the carrot's great, but you can see how we test always because everything has, yeah, like an opposite effect. It's like a double-edged sword. We thought it's going to cut one way, but it cut us back the other way. It hurts.

 

[2:46:25] So again, a lot of testing. But the carrot is definitely important. It's how you implement it and what you implement. That's what matters, right?

NÚMEROS: 6-7 equipes, todos atingiram bônus no último mês

 

VISUAL: Eficácia de bônus mensais, pressão positiva de grupo

 

[2:46:50] Monthly bonuses, I would say, work really, really well. Back in the days when we had one call closes. Christy remembers this because she was part of that team. The months we had monthly bonuses for two months, every single, actually the last month, every single team hit their team revenue bonus and every single team unlocked a bonus.

 

[2:47:20] And Christy, we had what, seven or six teams back then? It was like six, right? Six or seven. Yeah, I think it was around six or seven, yeah. Yeah, and then your team was like the team that barely made it, but you guys barely made it last minute. Oh yeah. I remember that. Yeah, so.

 

[2:47:50] And I remember I was that person that everybody's like, come on, you just need one more. It made it where the whole group was now in a nice way ganging up on that one person holding them back. Like, come on, you could do it. You could do it. You got one more and we all get it. It was great.

 

[2:48:15] Yeah. And so, yeah, like every team hit their bonus that month. So again, carrots work, right? Your team, they can produce a lot more.

[2:48:40] And then obviously public private recognition, that's another way to do it. Sometimes, like I told the team, right? It doesn't always have to be a monetary financial gift. Some people really appreciate recognition more than money. Believe it or not, right?

 

[2:49:05] Some people actually disappreciate that more, right? I mean, it depends on the amount of money, but people do appreciate recognition, right? Could be their compensation, right? You could change it.

 

[2:49:25] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Stick Examples"

 

NÚMEROS: 7am huddles mencionado

 

VISUAL: Remoção da equipe, huddles obrigatórios, oportunidades perdidas

 

[2:49:30] Some of the stick examples would be obviously we talked about it. You could remove them if they don't meet certain results within a certain timeframe. Felix, want to talk about the mandatory huddles that James is going to start doing?

 

[2:49:55] Yeah, I can. So what we're doing this month with the team is that... Does the team know yet? Does Aaron know yet? Does Adam and Aaron know yet? Oh, yeah, they do. Oh, they do? Okay, okay.

 

[2:50:20] So what happened is that we have a minimum standard that we set for the team for the monthly, and at the halfway point, we basically say if anyone haven't met the halfway point, like basically standard divided by two, they're going to have to jump on a mandatory huddle with James and I on a specific time every single day.

 

[2:50:50] And the idea is they have to come into these huddles every single day before they actually get back on track. Yeah. So again, right, so there's a time where 7am, some people don't want to wake up at that time, but because they're low performers, they are forced to be at that meeting until they get their sales numbers up, right?

 

[2:51:20] So it's like there's things like that where you can create kind of creative examples. And of course, those meetings are not to shame them or to beat them up. Those meetings are really to help them get better.

 

[2:51:40] So Felix, you want to answer Bobby's question? So for those low performer huddles, what do you guys do? You guys just like hug each other, sing kumbaya and turn on Zoom and sing together? Like what do you guys do, right?

 

[2:52:05] Yeah, we're going to pray to the God and hope that someone comes out. No, I'm just kidding. Yeah, pray to God, hoping that the closer can close more sales, right? Because it's so bad. We're going to do a ceremony. Sacrifice a lamb, maybe?

 

[2:52:30] So what's going to happen is we're going to go through every single key metrics that we're looking at, like number of calls, number of emails, number of outreach. We basically do that grow method that we do, like similar idea, right?

 

[2:52:55] We go through every single key metrics to make sure that they are setting a goal for the day, meeting the goal, and then the next day come back. Are they still on track? If they're not, right?

 

[2:53:15] So imagine the number, you know, the intensity of the accountability that these guys will be getting if they hold to that standard. It's almost to a point you might think it's micromanaging, but it's not. But at the same time, it is because we're really looking at every single details that what did you do? What exactly did you do, right?

 

[2:53:45] Because that is what it takes for anyone to actually, let me say it's a numbers game. Yeah. So Bobby, that answers your question. They're going to look at key metrics and then hold you accountable to getting those metrics. If you say you're going to do 50 calls, you do 50 calls, right? For example, right? That day.

 

[2:54:15] And if not, then you get consequences, again, things like that. Yeah, so yeah, low performance is a pain, right? It is a pain.

NÚMEROS: 22, 18, 13 vendas, 7-10 threshold, 1-3 vendas baixo desempenho

 

VISUAL: Oportunidades de back-end apenas para top performers

 

[2:54:40] And then the last one, maybe Christy, you want to talk about missed opportunities due to failure to perform? We've done that for B2C quite often. Yep, we do that very often. We have some back-end sales that we let them know that if you are a top performer and you're doing well, you'll get more closing opportunities.

 

[2:55:10] And in some cases, it's more or less of a, what I would like to say, a easier opportunity in some cases, right? So what this means is if you do not perform, that's fine. You're not kicked off from the team, but you're not going to get the opportunity to make maybe double your income in three weeks, right?

 

[2:55:40] So that's the opportunity that they would be missing because maybe there are, because we have people that do like 22 sales, 18, 13 sales. Okay, we're going to give them a shot first. And if you're able to get over, let's say, seven or 10, okay, now we'll put you into that ring and put you into that step forward.

 

[2:56:10] But if you're only going to have one, two, or three, you didn't really earn the privilege of getting these other opportunities. And that even goes for the managers themselves as well, that if our team is not performing, we also miss opportunities as well.

 

[2:56:35] Yeah. And that's so true what Christy just said there. This applies not just to the closers, but to the managers and to myself, right? When I report to Sifu, exactly the same thing. Carrot and stick, carrot and stick. I have it too. I am given a carrot and stick every day by Sifu too, right? It's the exact same thing.

[2:57:10] The missed opportunities, I'll give you an example. So those of you that are curious what the example is, you guys know that obviously we have a support at highticketseals.com email, right? And in that email, we get a lot of hand raisers. You guys know what hand raisers are? HubSpot talks about hand raisers. People who are really hot, they just...

 

[2:57:40] Why are they being such a bad apple? Right? We don't want that kind of person in the company. And then it spreads. It spreads like wildfire. When really, it was a complete misunderstanding.

VISUAL: Controle emocional antes de comunicar, analogia do tubo de pasta de dente

 

[2:58:05] And it's hard. It's very similar. How many of you have heard of somebody just telling you, hey, go ahead and squeeze a tube of toothpaste. And then try to put it back in. Can you do it? Adam says yes. Well, you've got to be very persistent, I guess.

 

[2:58:30] But odds are you're going to get some of it in. But you're not going to get the whole thing back. It's the same thing with your words. Once you say them, I'm sorry is only going to go so far. So it's better to have your emotions in check, check them at the door. If you really want the drama, which I don't know why, grab it on the way out.

 

[2:59:00] Yeah, that's really well said. Love it. Felix? Yeah, I think that it comes down to one thing too. It's your self-awareness to your current emotional state. Like where you're at. Sometimes it could go the other way. You're really excited about something.

 

[2:59:25] I caught myself multiple times when I come up with this genius idea. I'm like, yeah, I love it. This is so good. It's going to make the team so much better. I can't wait to tell my team about this. I'll also have those kind of moments too when I'm like, yeah.

 

[2:59:50] But then I have to always be really aware. Okay, let's slow down a little bit. How am I going to convey this so that the team is actually clear about why I'm actually about this? Why is it actually good for the team?

 

[3:00:15] So it's not only happened to when you are angry, when you're not in a good emotional state. But sometimes you have those moments when you go like, oh, yeah, this is so exciting. I'm going to tell my team right now. You have those times.

 

[3:00:40] But it depends on the occasions. You also need to make sure you are handling the emotional state to make sure that you're not just blasting energy but you're not giving the – like when you think about Sapphire, being too Sapphire about something.

 

[3:01:05] But you might go over that without you covering the details that you needed. So think about that on the flip side of not just you being mad or anything like that.

 

[3:01:25] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Extreme Ownership"

 

NÚMEROS: Não especificado

 

VISUAL: Tomar responsabilidade total, não culpar outros, mentalidade de crescimento

 

[3:01:30] Okay, so talking about – this is to me – it's kind of tied back to growth mindset, right? When it comes to taking ownership of everything that happened to you, right, instead of blaming. So anyone know what extreme ownership means? Can anyone type in the chat what does extreme ownership mean to you?

 

[3:02:00] That's a really good question. I love that. Let's see how people explain that. It doesn't matter what happens. It's my fault, okay? Personal responsibility. Taking responsibility for your current situation. Taking responsibility for everything that happens in my life. Best collaborator. Makes no excuses.

 

[3:02:30] Okay, yeah, we got some good definitions there, Felix. Yeah, I think those are kind of the concept of it. But if you really think a little bit deeper, right, like, yeah, you're taking ownership of everything. But, you know, I've heard even this question I asked myself, like, okay, like, why? It's technically not my fault.

 

[3:03:00] Like, you know, like those emerald, right? It was like, wait, why would that be me? Why would this be my fault, right? When you just got blamed for something, like, wait, what? It doesn't make sense.

 

[3:03:20] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Extreme Ownership Explained"

 

NÚMEROS: Não especificado

 

VISUAL: Não é sobre se culpar pessoalmente, é sobre buscar soluções e crescimento

 

[3:03:25] But here's the thing. Extreme ownership doesn't mean that you're taking everything to yourself, saying, like, oh, it must be me. And you're going super hard on yourself, right? You would never want to take things personally, meaning that, like, if something happened to your team, yes, you want to take extreme ownership of, okay, what can I do better, right?

 

[3:03:55] You need to think the next thing, right? You make a mistake, right? Expect to make mistakes. In fact, mistakes are actually the key of making extreme ownership works, meaning that you're expecting this to come. I'm cool. Okay, well, I'll make mistakes anyways, no matter what decision I make.

 

[3:04:25] But what can I learn from this and move on? And what extreme ownership really encouraged to me is you make blaming others unacceptable, right? If everybody in your team is taking extreme ownership, there's no blaming each other.

 

[3:04:50] There's a lot less politics that's happening in the team, but more thinking about, okay, what can I do to help the team? And when you think about that, it actually inspires creativity as well, right? How can you solve a problem in a different way, right?

 

[3:05:15] The more everybody individually think about how to solve a problem, they become more creative. So your mistakes is a must in extreme ownership, and as a manager, the buck ends with you, right?

 

[3:05:40] If your team today is not performing, is it the team's problem? Is it you as a manager's problem? You have to ask yourself that question. And I always challenge myself, like, hey, you know, we didn't make any result in this month. Oh, yeah, you know, I could easily say, yeah, you know, this close to A, close to B, you know, at the bottom 20, they didn't do anything, right? It must be them, right? I could easily do that.

 

[3:06:15] But when we are taking extreme ownership, then it becomes like each individual go like, all right, like, even the teammates could go, well, my bottom 20, you know, my closers in the team who are in the bottom 20, they are not performing.

 

[3:06:40] Am I helping them enough while I was making a result for myself? Am I, you know, offering my hands to help them out to do an extra role play to help them, right? Can you see how much of a difference when everyone is taking extreme ownership of a team results versus you're just looking at where the problem is and just point at it, right?

 

[3:07:10] So the last point, you're not only responsible for your own actions, but your teams as well. If your team, one day they, you know, someone disappeared or someone just all of a sudden they don't, they're not pleasant, they're not performing as they could.

 

[3:07:35] Are you taking responsible to think about how can you help them? Or are you just thinking about, all right, as long as I'm making, you know, I'm doing well myself, I'm good. Now, if you take your team as part of your ownership, you know, the team becomes so much more powerful and so much more empowering to anything that they do.

 

[3:08:05] Joey, have anything to add to this? Yeah, I love what you said there. And one thing that you can look at it, I think Umer, I noticed Umer's comment there earlier, but when you take extreme ownership, right, you're really solutions minded in terms of what Felix said.

 

[3:08:30] You kind of not look at a past. Obviously you have to acknowledge that the mistake was made. So let me give you like my breakdown in my head. It's like, you know, if the mistake is made, it doesn't matter if you're, you know, let's say your team's involved in it, right?

 

[3:08:55] Everyone in the team takes extreme ownership, but you as the manager, you have to take extreme ownership and report to your direct report, who is the one maybe above, who is upper management, right? You have to take extreme ownership.

 

[3:09:20] But then there's two things in this and that moment too. One would be, okay, we made a mistake. Now, what do we do about the mistake? What am I and what is my team going to act on on correcting that mistake?

 

[3:09:45] Because here's where a lot of people fall short a little bit on extreme ownership. They say, oh, I take extreme ownership. I'm sorry, it's my fault. It won't happen again. And then done, they move on, right? They just say, you know what? Got it. It's my bad. Extreme ownership, it won't happen again. Done. Right?

 

[3:10:15] But then I would argue that's actually not truly, that's not fully extreme ownership yet. Because if you were to take true extreme ownership, you would go back to the mistake and see whatever you could to fix the mistake. You would go back to the mistake and try to fix it.

 

[3:10:45] So that way, whoever it has to deal with it doesn't have to deal with your shit, right? That's extreme ownership, right? So it's not just saying, oh, I take extreme ownership. I'm sorry, my bad. Then ignore it. You know what? I fucked up. I take extreme ownership. I'm sorry. Let me go to the mistake and let me see what mess I made. Let me clean it up if I can. And I will do it, like, now, right?

 

[3:11:20] That's extreme ownership. And then as well, then it's moving forward. It's like, okay, then what am I going to do, put in place so this doesn't happen again in the future? That's what extreme ownership is, right?

 

[3:11:45] So, like, yeah, I think the key there is to go back and actually fix the mistake you made. Some people forget that part, unfortunately. It's not really extreme ownership, right? Because then it's just saying sorry. And anyone can say sorry. Anyone can say they're not going to do it again. But the problem is the mess is already made. And that's got to be cleaned up one way or the other, right? So, yeah.

 

[3:12:20] Yeah. So love it. Love it. Now, the last couple slides is we're going to end with an activity before assignments tonight. So anything else from Christine Felix before we move on to our final activity for tonight? Final engagement act. Nope, I don't have anything to add. You pretty much covered exactly what I was going to go over.

 

[3:12:50] Love it. that and then implement. Cool. Awesome, awesome, awesome.

[3:13:10] Now, assignment for tonight, got quite a bit for you guys, right? You guys got a lot to implement. Like, that's a lot of good stuff in there. Would you agree? Quite a bit. Like the one takeaway, maybe change your vocabulary instead of saying, I don't have time for that, right? Say it's not a priority, right?
