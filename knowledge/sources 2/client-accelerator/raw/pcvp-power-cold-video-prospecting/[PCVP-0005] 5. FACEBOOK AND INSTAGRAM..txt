[00:00]"Hey guys, what's going on? So, for this specific perfect cold video pitch, I'm going to be selling to the restaurant niche, Facebook and Instagram services, which could include content distribution, which could also include some paid advertising."

 

[00:15]"And I'm just going to use a different industry as an example here. So, I picked one of my favorite restaurants, Planta and South Beach. Great vegan restaurant. And I'm going to jump right into the video now as if I'm pitching."

 

[00:28]"Hey, what's going on, Planta? So, I'm reaching out to you guys. I don't necessarily know who I'm talking to. I doubt I'm talking to the owner, David Griman. But nonetheless, whoever the managing director is, the marketing team, just make sure you pay attention to this video."

 

[00:45]"I'm going to talk about exactly what you guys can do to drive more revenue, more leads into your business. I just noticed there's a lot of opportunity here for you guys."

[00:56]"As when I go to your Facebook page, I can actually click on this info and ad tabs and I can just see if you guys are running any ads or not. So, what I did, I made sure, of course, you guys were posting. That way, I could tell that this page was at least actively run by you guys."

 

[01:12]"It does look like it was verified by your business as well. You know, Dave, I can recognize this is your wife. You know, I follow you on Instagram, too."

 

[01:20]"But, nonetheless, you guys obviously have a lot of great connections given the amount of celebrities you guys work with and the other businesses that you guys have locally here inside of Miami, including Club Live and obviously all the different restaurants."

 

[01:33]"Congratulations on Swan, the recent opening that you just had. But long story short, when I dive into the amount of videos that you guys have been posting, it's rare to none."

 

[01:44] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Video Content Analysis"

 

NÚMEROS: 3 vídeos, algumas centenas de visualizações

 

VISUAL: Análise de conteúdo de vídeo na página, mostrando baixo engajamento apesar de usar credibilidade de celebridades

 

[01:46]"You guys have three. Although it's once again leveraging a lot of different celebrity credibility and authority here, these have not got more than a couple hundred views."

 

[01:56]"So, the point I'm trying to make with this is that if you distribute these videos on a local level to the entire city, you can target people who are vegan, you can target vegetarians, you can also just target people who are health conscious in general right here in the city, both traveling to and the people who occupy it and live here full-time."

 

[02:17]"But if we just go over the exact process that you guys could do, your current staff, like I said, they can follow along and you should have some marketers in-house or that you use as an agency that'll be able to implement this for you."

 

[02:30] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Service Proposal"

 

NÚMEROS: $3,000

 

VISUAL: Proposta de serviço hands-on, taxa com desconto, troca por comida gratuita

 

[02:32]"If you don't, we'll charge $3,000 to do this hands-on with you guys. And we'll make sure that in addition to just helping you guys out, maybe hook us up with some free food here and there. That way, we don't have to charge as much. So 3K is kind of a discounted rate past what we normally do."

 

[02:48]"But nonetheless, I figured this would be a good opportunity for us to create a relationship together this way. So, here we go."

 

[02:54] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Content Creation Strategy"

 

NÚMEROS: Não especificados numericamente

 

VISUAL: Processo de documentação de conteúdo em tempo real: hostesses, garçons, chefs na cozinha, fotos em modo retrato antes da comida ir para a mesa

 

[02:56]"You have your content that I'm sure can be documented in real time by some hostesses or some waiters or waitresses or even just the chefs in the kitchen or have a designated person that before the food goes to the table takes a nice portrait mode shot that you can share not only on Instagram but here on Facebook and locally run it or pair it with some ads."

 

[03:17] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Cheesecake Factory Case Study"

 

NÚMEROS: 5 milhões de likes, apenas 20K de alcance

 

VISUAL: Página do Facebook da Cheesecake Factory, aba "Info and Ads", vídeos em câmera lenta de comidas, comparação de alcance orgânico vs potencial pago

 

[03:19]"An example of that would be the Cheesecake Factory. If you go to their Facebook page, you click on the info and ads tab, they are not distributing content, meaning they are not putting out their content, which could be their videos where they're shooting slow motion shots of all the different foods that they have."

 

[03:36]"Like you see here, this video specifically would be an incredible video to run right towards an audience of people who might have already been aware of what Cheesecake Factory is to keep their brand in front of the people who could go into all the restaurants they have around the United States and in different parts of the world."

 

[03:53]"You can see here on the different videos that they have, they get pretty good reach on their results, but it's horrible because they have 5 million likes on their page. So only 20K people seeing it versus 5 million people that could see it in total."

 

[04:08]"They're just not paying for that content to get in front of the people who already like them. And Facebook, Instagram, they will not take your content and put it in front of the audience even though they've already liked your page. It is a pay-to-play space now."

NÚMEROS: 5-15 segundos de duração de vídeo

 

VISUAL: Exemplos de fotos e vídeos do Cheesecake Factory que podem ser transformados em anúncios, processo de conversão de conteúdo orgânico em pago

 

[04:24]"So anyway, I'm not selling you on likes, comments, shares, and views to be very clear. I'm just saying just like Cheesecake Factory, they're an incredible example of the photos and videos that can be taken that are five to 15 seconds long that can then be turned into ads."

 

[04:39]"Now, why would you want to run videos as ads? And why would you want to spend any money? And how are you going to make that money back with running content towards people?"

 

[04:47] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Facebook Campaign Objectives"

 

NÚMEROS: 1-2 centavos por engajamento ou visualização de vídeo

 

VISUAL: Interface do Facebook Ads mostrando dois objetivos: Video View e Engagement, comparação de custos

 

[04:49]"Well, to be clear, when you go into Facebook and you create a campaign on these two different objectives, one of them is a video view objective and one of them is the engagement objective, you'll get the opportunity to pay literally one to two pennies per engagement or per video view."

 

[05:04]"And just like when you're acquiring an email for an email list and you have the ability to use that at a later point to send emails to those people to follow up with them to hopefully increase the amount of sales you get, we invest as business owners into building emails list because it's a follow-up medium that we control that we can leverage for life after people opt in."

NÚMEROS: Não especificados numericamente

 

VISUAL: Comparação entre listas de email e listas de retargeting do Facebook/Instagram, conceito de segmentação de interação social

 

[05:27]"The same thing and the same tools apply now right here inside of Facebook and inside of Facebook as well for Instagram. Rather than just being able to retarget people based on them going to our websites, we can create lists just like email lists to segment the social interaction that happens on our Facebook and Instagram pages and with the video views."

 

[05:48]"So imagine Cheesecake Factory or you being somebody who could recreate videos just like this for the foods at your restaurant. You can see all these different examples, create them, post them, then we can distribute them towards people that are in the local markets for where you'd want to sell people."

 

[06:06] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Video Threshold Segmentation"

 

NÚMEROS: 3 segundos, 10 segundos, 25%, 50%, 75%, 95%

 

VISUAL: Níveis de segmentação de visualização de vídeo, processo de qualificação de leads baseado em engajamento com vídeo

 

[06:08]"And here's the best part. You'd have the opportunity to retarget the people who watch to certain thresholds of the video, which is extremely valuable."

 

[06:16]"Imagine you're targeting people who have never been to your restaurant traveling here into Miami that get to see three different videos of different dishes that you have that are some of the most bought dishes that you sell."

 

[06:28]"And let's say that for every person who watches that video, you get to segment all the video viewers based on who watched 3 seconds, 10 seconds, 25%, 50%, 75%, 95%."

 

[06:40]"Well, now that you have those segmented lists, just like email lists, you can use them to follow up. So now you can run ads towards these people called conversion campaigns. You could run traffic campaigns."

 

[06:52] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "OpenTable Integration"

 

NÚMEROS: Não especificados numericamente

 

VISUAL: Link do OpenTable no Google, homepage do site com captura de reservas, processo de conversão direta

 

[06:54]"I noticed on Google that you guys have an open table link which is incredible because that means that you have a direct link that people can go to where they can automatically set a reservation. In addition to that, you guys have a great homepage. So your actual website also does an incredible job and can capture reservations and can further the opportunity to create leads."

 

[07:15]"So here's my point. Now that you've gotten a few people into a list that at one point never knew who you were, that now you've qualified to watching a certain threshold in the videos of great food that sells the most."

 

[07:28] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Social Interaction Lists"

 

NÚMEROS: Não especificados numericamente

[07:30]"And now what you're going to do with these lead lists, keep in mind, anybody who interacts with your social media page, anybody who interacts with a specific post, presses a call to action button, messages the page, saves a post, even better, right? You get to put those people in lists as well."

VISUAL: Estrutura de campanha de tráfego, cálculo de ROI, matemática de conversão de reservas

 

[07:48]"You can then go in and just create a new ad for a traffic campaign is what it's called, which means you're sending people from Facebook or Instagram to a website. And you could plug in your URL. It'd cost you about 10 cents to a dollar most likely on a cost per click basis."

 

[08:04]"And for every 50 to 100 people or so, you might get between 10 and 20 new reservations, which if you have an average order of about two people coming in with an average bill coming out to about $70, you of course could tell me the profit margin on spending an extra $4,000 $5,000 in a month and potentially making back $10,000 $20,000 in the month."

 

[08:27]"And in addition to that, making back that money in lifetime value because you'd get customers for life most likely, especially when targeting the local markets."

NÚMEROS: 1 centavo (conteúdo) vs $0.10-$1.00 (tráfego direto)

 

VISUAL: Comparação de custos entre distribuição de conteúdo e tráfego direto, processo de aquecimento de audiência

 

[08:37]"So anyway, long story short, I just noticed that you have all these great video assets and just other posts and on top of that you have great food. You have an opportunity to take a very visually pleasing image and very short visually pleasing videos just like Cheesecake Factory is doing and then you can start running ads."

 

[08:55]"The process once again push content first because it's a penny instead of 10 cents to a dollar to get people to your website. And that cost for taking people to your website, by the way, it's more expensive when you target people who don't know you versus targeting the people who do and have watched these videos and become warmed up."

Once again, we're willing to do this for $3,000, but since I'm here local, I'd also love to come in and just have a general exchange to be able to get some food whenever I'd like. Maybe on a once every other week basis or something if that's cool, since we'll bring you guys a lot of value and additional customers."

 

[10:17]"Anyway, if this is something that we can execute on, that's great. If not, as I said, show this to your staff. You'll still get incredible value out of this. And I appreciate the time. Our contact information is in the description below here. And I look forward to doing some business with you guys."
