[00:02] Most people at this point in the game will have marketing automation, meaning they'll have some email follow-up created after you opt into one of their lead forms or, you know, you sign up for one of their services or products, especially after you sign up for something that is revenue generated for a business.

 

[00:21] They'll send you things like confirmations to appointments, product access, service details, etc. All kind of stuff.

 

[00:28] And my point being is that most people's businesses, if you think about how agency owners are able to sell services to begin with, it's either from giving businesses opportunities to drive more leads and revenue with digital services they have not yet implemented yet or updating existing services that they've invested in in the past to the most recent technology.

VISUAL: Linha do tempo de evolução tecnológica: Flash Pages → HTML/Dreamweaver → WordPress → Funnels Modernos, representação visual da progressão de tecnologias web

 

[00:53] As clear examples of that with other industries besides marketing automation, let's look at the web development industry. You know, back in the day before people even had websites, they would develop flash pages and then they developed HTML websites where they would use programs like Dreamweaver and all kinds all kinds of programs.

 

[01:12] My point being is that nowadays uh people got updated to WordPress. In modern times, we see businesses that are getting upgraded to funnels and building out on modern technology platforms that can enable faster turnaround.

 

[01:25] All along those journeys in a business where they're updating their technology, there's an agency or several agencies or digital marketers or contractors, whoever they go with that come in as specialists to implement that new technology to give these people more leads and more sales.

 

[01:42] So, long story short, the same logic goes for all the other areas that we offer as digital services.

 

[01:47] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "MiniChat Platform Introduction"

 

NÚMEROS: 2018 Conference

 

VISUAL: Logo e interface do MiniChat.com, plataformas de integração (Facebook, WhatsApp futuro), demonstração de chatbot builder

 

[01:49] Marketing automation. One of the biggest opportunities right now for that uh in my opinion with chat bots and using tools like minihat.com as your as your chatbot builder uh and then connecting that to platforms like Facebook.

 

[02:03] I was actually at the Minihat conferences 2018 and the CEO he was speaking about bringing on WhatsApp as a platform.

 

[02:10] So there's a lot of opportunity here where this is going to continue expanding and just offering businesses more ways to make money and connect with customers.

 

[02:19] But to be clear, there are so many different businesses that have all these emails created and the email follow-up created, which is the marketing automation.

 

[02:28] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Chatbots vs Email Performance"

 

NÚMEROS: Higher open rates, higher click-through rates

 

VISUAL: Comparação visual entre email marketing tradicional e chatbots, gráficos mostrando taxas de abertura e cliques superiores, compressão da jornada do cliente

 

[02:30] And long story short, they need to update to chat bots because chat bots are getting higher open rates. They're getting higher click-through rates.

 

[02:39] And also really condenses the customer journey uh into a significantly shorter duration of time to get to key points in the funnel where people can convert or increase their transaction value with the companies that we're helping.

 

[02:54] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Restaurant Use Case Example"

 

NÚMEROS: 15 minutos antes da mesa estar pronta

 

VISUAL: Cenário de restaurante: reserva online → notificação de mesa pronta → upsell de menu/especiais do dia, comparação entre email confirmation vs messenger notification

 

[02:56] As an example, imagine uh you you go to your favorite restaurant, you know, you book a table online nowadays and you get an email confirmation.

 

[03:05] Well, that's great, but you might prefer to get a message notification when your table's ready, uh when you're 15 minutes to your table being ready if the restaurant had a a more advanced chatbot.

 

[03:17] Maybe they'd even upsell you before you come and show you what's on the menu or what specials are there today.

 

[03:23] And you have a much higher probability of opening it just from the industry data that shows how many more people are opening uh chat bots and m and messenger conversations than they are their email nowadays checking it in higher frequency.

 

[03:38] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Cedar Point Case Study"

 

NÚMEROS: 1.5+ milhões de likes na página

 

VISUAL: Página do Facebook do Cedar Point, ausência de opção de messenger, análise de oportunidades perdidas, localização em Ohio/Lake Erie

 

[03:40] So many different ways for you to tap this in all these different industries. I'm going to give you a video pitch example for one of my favorite amusement parks growing up where I was raised in Ohio. It was one of the only things to do. It was called Cedar Point.

 

[03:54] I found on their page here they don't even have a messenger option. And they don't they don't even give me the ability to message their page.

 

[04:02] But they do all kinds of stuff. You know, during the winters, they're completely out of business cuz in Ohio it just snows a lot and they're on Lake Yuri. So, yeah, pretty bad place to be.

 

[04:14] During the winter time, your business goes, you know, they run out of money pretty much.

 

[04:19] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Cedar Point Seasonal Operations"

 

NÚMEROS: 1 novo brinquedo por ano

 

VISUAL: Operações sazonais: inverno fechado vs temporada de pico, eventos especiais de outubro (casas assombradas), lançamentos anuais de atrações

 

[04:21] During their their peak seasons and when they're actually open, they do all kinds of stuff. You know, during October, they have haunted houses. They introduce a new ride every single year.

 

[04:31] So, that could be something they could be sending out in the form of a chatbot to all their existing customers and all the people who are just opted into their database.

 

[04:40] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Chatbot Use Cases for Cedar Point"

 

NÚMEROS: Não especificado

 

VISUAL: Lista de informações que poderiam ser automatizadas via chatbot: condições climáticas, hospedagem, direções, estacionamento, custos adicionais, compra de ingressos extras

 

[04:42] Imagine you're about to go to the park. You want to know things like uh the weather conditions for the day specific to that area if you're traveling in.

 

[04:51] This is one of the world's top rated amusement parks. So, you might actually, you know, it's it's pretty random or low probability that this is going to be happening, but travel to Ohio to be going to an amusement park.

 

[05:03] But still, uh this does happen. So, people might want to know lodging, uh where to actually stay for a hotel. They might want to know directions, uh, the best places to park, uh, how much parking is, all their additional costs and fees.

 

[05:18] You can even give people the ability to buy additional tickets. I used to be a season passholder and it was called a platinum pass.

 

[05:25] And long story short, there were levels to that pass.

 

[05:28] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "FAQ Automation Strategy"

 

NÚMEROS: Não especificado

 

VISUAL: Transformação de FAQ tradicional em chatbot conversacional, redução de chamadas telefônicas, automação de suporte ao cliente

 

[05:30] I want to be clear, when you offer a product or service, you of course have questions. Uh you commonly see this on web pages in the FAQ section where their common objections or just stall points that hold people back from spending money with them or just common support questions that need answered are addressed in an FAQ.

 

[05:50] Well, you could break down that same logic into a chatbot to where people have so many different options uh to be able to get information in real time without having to communicate to somebody over the phone.

 

[06:02] So businesses love this. If you've ever called a business, especially nowadays, most people are automating their flow. So they're uh not allowing you to talk to a human.

 

[06:12] And this is exactly what a chatbot is. So this is one of the best ways that you can do this.

 

[06:17] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "MiniChat Sequences Logic"

 

NÚMEROS: Não especificado

 

VISUAL: Interface do MiniChat mostrando sequências de mensagens, delays entre mensagens, fluxos condicionais (if/then), estrutura de árvore de decisão

 

[06:19] I'm going to give you guys some examples of, you know, how chatbot work, how chat bots work, and just all the cool stuff that you can do inside of Minihat, which is the software that I prefer to build out mine.

 

[06:29] Uh you have this logic called sequences. And when you're using a sequence, it's really just a series of messages with a delay of time in between it.

 

[06:38] But the specific flow that you are sending to somebody is in their messenger and and it looks like this has all these different options you know if they click on this uh then send them over here uh if they click on that you know then send them to this option.

 

[06:53] So it's just a bunch of uh if this then do that you know if they do this then do that you know if they click on this send them that and opt them into this.

 

[07:02] So it's just a lot of it's a lot of creativity on your end that you get to leverage into this.

 

[07:07] So, without further ado, I'm going to do a pitch uh like I'm promoting this company called Cedar Point, and I want to show you guys how that process would work.

 

[07:16] So, without further ado, I'm going to jump in.

[07:21] Hey, what's going on, Cedar Point? Uh, I know I'm probably talking to a manager or a marketer or hopefully an executive, but I want to be clear. You likely have no idea who I am, and I'm solely focused on making you more money and driving you more sales into your business.

 

[07:36] Uh, this is practical. This is a how-to video. Your staff or your marketers, your agency you're working with, they could use this exact video to generate some ideas and implement what you could pay me to do instead if you'd like.

 

[07:50] We offer consulting and we offer hands-on services to do what we're going to talk about here today. And we want to implement what's called a chatbot.

NÚMEROS: Platinum Pass (múltiplos níveis)

 

VISUAL: Análise da presença digital atual do Cedar Point: newsletter, venda de ingressos, platinum pass, eventos de Halloween, informações de suporte

 

[08:01] So, most people, especially businesses, when somebody opts in for information on their website, either to join a newsletter, uh even just to buy a ticket to your amusement park or to buy a platinum pass, like I used to be a holder back in the day.

 

[08:16] Maybe they want information around uh the holidays, uh on on your haunted houses, or maybe they want to know directions or the best lodging opportunities.

 

[08:25] Or maybe you could take all your general support questions that you guys get over the phone or that you have listed on your website and and on your support articles and documentation here and duplicate it into a more conversational style way for people to ask questions and for them to get answers.

 

[08:43] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Value Proposition Summary"

 

NÚMEROS: Não especificado

 

VISUAL: Benefícios principais: aumentar open rates, reduzir tempo de resposta, aumentar acesso à informação, tudo via chatbots

 

[08:45] Long story short, I want to take what you guys are likely doing in email and I want to increase the amount of people that are opening those messages.

 

[08:53] I want to reduce the amount of time it takes to give people information. I want to increase the amount of information that your customers and potential customers can get access to all leveraging chat bots.

[09:18] You can currently take a lot of what's already in your email, a lot of what's on your support pages, a lot of what your sales people are doing successfully, and we can duplicate that into what's called a chatbot.

 

[09:30] So the cool thing about this is it's like having a real conversation with a real person that can be improved upon the more data that we get and we control the whole process.

 

[09:40] What people see when they see it, what messages they get after they see a certain message.

[09:48] And the big difference here with leveraging chat bots instead of emails is that you're getting a much higher open rate.

 

[09:54] So, if I just Google for you real quick, so you can see this chatbot versus email open rates.

 

[10:00] You're getting 70 to 80% email open rates right now. I'm sorry. You're getting 70 to 80% chatbot open rates, whereas your average email is going to be between five and 20% if you're doing good and you have a really engaged really engaged list.

NÚMEROS: $5,000 implementação hands-on

 

VISUAL: Analogia de evolução tecnológica: HTML → WordPress = Email → Chatbots, apresentação de investimento de $5K

 

[10:51] And to be crystal clear, you'd pay us a mere $5,000 for us to make you more leads, more sales, more predictably, increase open rates, increase click-through rates significantly.

 

[11:03] And all in all, it's kind of like back in the day when you had a website that was built on HTML and then WordPress came out. It's a better technology. It's more powerful. It's more robust.

 

[11:13] It offers more services and just overall a better brand impression to the people who are hitting your page and interacting with you guys.

VISUAL: Comparação visual entre lista de email vs base de messenger, tendência decrescente do email vs crescimento do messenger

And that would be a significant amount of people to have opted in just like an email list, but right inside of your messenger where they're opening and clicking at 60 to 120x higher levels of engagement than they are in their email, which is currently dying and statistically downtrending.

 

[11:45] So, I'm really excited to bring this opportunity to the table for you guys.

NÚMEROS: Não especificado

 

VISUAL: Interface visual do MiniChat mostrando fluxos complexos de chatbot, múltiplos caminhos de decisão, estrutura if/then, opções de botões AB

 

[12:08] And it's really cool. There's there's a lot of different flows that you create. And this this is a visual of how it looks. I don't want to overwhelm you or anything, but this is how simple it is.

 

[12:17] You know, as an example, if somebody clicks on this specific option, it takes them over to this specific step. If they click on this option, it'll take them over to a different step.

 

[12:25] Uh we have time in between based on the keywords that people are responding with. We can respond back strategically so it's like they're having a real conversation.

 

[12:34] We can also just control the conversation by giving people buttons to press as AB options.

 

[12:39] Like I said, I don't want to go too far in the trenches here, but I just want to give you a visual on how cool this stuff is and how many more people you're going to connect with faster.

 

[12:48] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Time Compression Comparison"

 

NÚMEROS: 2-3 semanas (email) vs 2 horas ou 20 minutos (chatbot), 10 emails por dia = sobrecarga

 

VISUAL: Comparação temporal: campanha de email tradicional (2-3 semanas) vs campanha de messenger (20 minutos a 2 horas), gráfico de compressão de tempo

 

[12:50] Imagine it takes on average between two to three weeks to give information to somebody via an email campaign.

 

[12:57] Because if I told you that you'd send 10 different emails to somebody in a day, you'd understand that they'd likely opt out.

 

[13:04] You know, you yourself wouldn't want to get 10 emails a day worth of quality information that you actually want because it's just too overbearing.

 

[13:12] We're psychologically not conditioned for that amount of information to come in an email. If you send too long of an email, it's unlikely the person's going to consume all of what you sent.

 

[13:23] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Conversational Format Advantages"

 

NÚMEROS: 60-120x maior engajamento

 

VISUAL: Interface de messenger mostrando formato conversacional: perguntas sim/não, opções múltiplas, venda contextual, suporte contextual

 

[13:25] However, when you break that down to a conversation, as you can see in a Messenger campaign, it's very conversational. It's very do you want this? Yes or no. Do you want to know more about this? Yes or no.

 

[13:36] Out of these options, what do you want to see or what don't you want to see? And you carry the conversation to the point where you can contextually sell the person. You can contextually give them the support information they need.

 

[13:48] And on top of that, you have a person who wants to know the information that they are getting rather than an email. You're kind of guessing.

 

[13:56] Uh you're sequentially sending things out and following up with people. Whereas in a messenger conversation, that two weeks could get crunched down into two hours or 20 minutes even with somebody consuming all of that information, opening it and engaging with it 60 to 120x higher than what they would via email.

 

[14:15] 📊 SLIDE DETECTADO ───────────────────────────── TEXTO: "Final Pricing & Integration"

 

NÚMEROS: $5K hands-on, $10K skill transfer

 

VISUAL: Integração com página do Facebook, comparação final de investimentos, benefícios de longo prazo

[14:45] And on top of that, just like email, this is an asset. So, you get the opportunity to follow up with these people at a later date. You get to continue messaging them after the initial conversation is had.

 

[14:56] You get to send broadcast to these people just like an email broadcast where you're following up the entire list.

 

[15:02] So, just as what you invested into to generate leads, uh this is the same concept, but right inside of Messenger with 60 to 120x higher engagement rates.
