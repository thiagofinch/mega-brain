3 - Consulting Niche - High Ticket Offer #2.mp4

What up, YouTube? I'm here sitting on my private jet with a million dollars in front of me. And if you watch this video, I'm going to show you how you can make up a jillion dollars in five seconds. So that one day you can be as awesome as me and there's just one problem, it's all fake. Look, I'm Russ Ruffino, and if you're a coach, consultant, expert, author, speaker, or author, I see the same YouTube ads that you do. People showing you their Lamborghinis and their piles of cash and all this other fake stuff just because they want you to think they're cool. But here's the thing. Stuff is so easy to fake, it's not even funny. What you can't fake is real revenue, real results.

And I've built a coaching business that's done over 50 million in high-ticket coaching sales in just the past few years. That's real. But you know what? Even that doesn't matter because it doesn't matter what I can do for myself. I mean, the only thing that matters is, but I can help you achieve. So let's talk about the three things that you need to really scale your business to the million dollar mark and beyond, all right? Number one, you need a high offer that sells for five thousand, eight thousand, ten thousand dollars or more. Now I know that sounds like a lot of money. I know you're probably not selling anything at that price yet, but stick with me and I'll explain to you a simple strategy you can use to make that happen.

Now, number two, you also need a simple marketing process that can attract new clients consistently, even at those high prices. Number three, you need to be able to do both of those things without spending all day on Instagram grinding out endless amounts of content or doing any of that boring marketing stuff that you don't want to do. So I want to invite you to join me on a special training that's happening today where I will walk you through exactly how I built a $50 million coaching company without any of that fake stuff, using just one 45-minute presentation. So for you, that means again, you don't need to blog, you don't need SEO, you don't need to do big launches, and you definitely definitely don't need to pretend to be somebody that you're not.

Just one 45-minute presentation is all it takes. It takes just a few days to make, then it can be the key asset in your business that allows you to attract new clients at $3,000 to $15,000 prices or more, like clockwork, anytime you want. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to check out this presentation right now. Click the link under this video. You're going to be taken to this signup page.

Now, Brian watched this same training, exact same training, put the strategies into use, and they were so powerful that within the next 10 weeks, In just 10 weeks, he was able to do close to $300,000 in revenue of his new program. And not only that, but within the next five months after that, he was able to collect over a million dollars. And guess what? That's not even the cool part. The cool part is— Brian is a handstand coach, right handstand coach of all things, and so how many handstand coaches do you know that are clearing over seven figures a year? I guarantee you, it's not that many. And that's what's so cool about this strategy. It doesn't matter what kind of coaching you do.

You could be a dating coach, relationship coach, therapist, a doctor. Financial advisor, as long as you create huge breakthroughs for your clients in their life or in their business, then you can use this exact same strategy to attract new clients into your business every single day. Day. And again, with just one 45-minute presentation, no big audience. You don't need a massive following. You don't need to spend all day on social media. In fact, this works even if nobody's ever heard of you. In fact, this strategy is so freaking powerful that it literally takes somebody from clicking on an ad to signing up with you as a new client for like $3,000, $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 or more within 24 to 48 hours.

Following, no big social media presence, and today she's doing multiple seven figures like clockwork after watching the same presentation that I just invited you to.
