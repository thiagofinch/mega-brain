72 - Effective Techniques to DISARM Your Prospect in Sales - YouTube.mp4
All right, Jeremy Miner. All right. So every Wednesday we go live in our Facebook group. And we interview a client. Now, there's certain criteria that these clients have to be. They have to have a certain percentage, certain closing percentage. They have to be at a certain amount of sales per month, per year to be interviewed. And they even have to be at like a certain level financially. Like obviously they're getting... results. So when you learn how to sell more, it's a good thing because your company's what? Your company is forced to have to pay you more because you're selling more. That's always a good thing. So every week we bring out a new client. Now, let's bring out this client. Vlad, how are you, my friend? Yeah, I'm not going to complain.
I'm doing good. It's always good when you learn skills to sell more. Life gets a little bit easier over there now. Just a little. Just a little bit. Now, Vlad, where do you live? You're over in Europe, right? Yeah, I'm living in Romania. Living in Romania, over there by Transylvania, or what's going on? Yeah, in the heart of it. That was a joke, but that makes sense. I love that. You see, if you're over in America, they always, you know, when they hear Romania, we think vampires and Transylvania. I mean, I know it sounds dumb, but that's what Americans think of. Now, what do you sell? What industry are you in? So right now I'm selling training for personal trainers to get there. How can I say it? Together.
to go into online fitness and good mormonian OK, so it's like in the fitness, like coaching industry, training industry where you saw like a program, maybe workout, nutrition stuff that helps people lose weight, get more muscle, get tone, get their health back. I was selling that and after that transition to like a visa for personal trainers to start their own business. Okay, so your company helps... People that are in that industry, like personal trainers that maybe work for a gym. It teaches them how to start their own kind of personal training. Business. Yeah. That's good. Online fitness. I love that. That's a big niche that we train as well. Now, how long have you been a client? I don't think I even asked you that before I got on here with you.
Yeah, I've been applying since October last year. You've been here forever. Not even a year. You've been here about 10 months. Now let's talk about, I want to talk about pre-NEPQ. And then I want to talk about. After any PQ and then, Uh, like I always promise everybody, we will always, uh, I'll ask you some questions about maybe what we've trained you. Cause I think you're in our advanced, uh, inner circle training program, right? Yeah. Okay. That's more industry specific, right? Where I basically do the group training calls. We only let 60, I think we only let 60 new people a month into that program or something. It's a very small group. We let in that program you have to get certified in other programs first.
But um, where we when we let you in there—uh, basically, we give you access to our industry-specific scripts for all industries and we teach you how to tweak those. I do that myself. Um, and really, the advanced tonality that's taught by me now. Let's go back before NEPQ. How did Vlad Stasel? So uh, before an EPQ, I just joined like uh online team selling fitness to um, to regular men and I was doing like consultative selling because that was the big thing in Romania last year and it's still now. It was decent, let's say, but I didn't feel like I could help the people because I was very surface-level with them. You're asking questions. Consultative selling, I would say it's better than boiler room selling for sure.
But you're asking questions to find the needs of the client. As you know, a lot of that type of question is more generalized kind of service level questions. And what type of answers did your prospects usually give you? very generalized, and I it was very hard for me even for commissions and everything because before that I did boiler room selling and learned to to just pressure them, objection-handle them, but... Well, that's not saying that we don't help them overcome their objections, but we do it in a lot more effective way, right? What type of, okay, so before you got into NEPQ, and I don't know if you track the data, but what do you feel like your closing percentages were? Uh, pre. It was it was around 32 to 37%.
Okay, so you're closing— not that's not horrible for that industry. Um, but as you know, can be better, uh, because I know people in the industry that close 15%. So you're definitely doing double, uh, what a lot of people. are that even use those techniques. Now, a lot of people would say, hey, I'm closing 32%, 35% in that industry. Now, that means different things in other industries, like if you're in life insurance. That's going to be completely different. They're like, I'm closing 35% of every age lead I talk to. They'd be extremely happy. But when you're getting inbound leads that book on your calendar, it's a different ballgame. What caused you, you know, 10 months ago to be like, 'Hey.' Maybe I can learn more skills.
Maybe I can learn better questions. Maybe I can learn how to use my tone edit. What caused you to go out there and and try to find better training. Yeah, when I started in that niche to sell, I stumbled around you on Instagram and I was following you. YouTube was on a run and in one of your videos you were asking, 'What is like your biggest expense in life and when you asked that, I was like, 'That Eu parei.' And really think about that. And when you said about the deals that I'm losing. I ran as fast as I could home and starting to calculate my last commission. Yeah. Think about it. Right. Cause like you're what, what, what do you make? Like, what does your company pay you?
Like on average per commission? And what do you get paid? Like per sale? Uh. In that industry, I was being paid like 150 euros. Okay. So about $150, 150 euros. Now, after you got into NEPQ and you got going, you got into our advanced inner circle program. Where did your closing percentages go to? So in the fitness, in the last month before we joined the other offer, it was 87 point something percent. So you're talking about, okay, yeah, because these are booked appointments and book leads, right? And that is extremely high for that industry. Like, if you can get up to 50%, you're— crushing it, you know, but if you get, you know, we had a lot of people in your space and that high ticket space that are doing 70, 75, 80, 85%.
So going from 32, 35% to 87%. What does that do for you? Yeah, it made me a lot of money, but not only the closing percentage, because I was able to sell the bigger packages. My income just ate 8x. Okay. Okay. So what you're saying is because a lot of salespeople, they might be selling quite a bit, but they don't have the skill sets to sell like higher price products or services or programs, right? They're selling like the bottom one because they can't overcome the money objection or they're afraid, you know, to even start up. Up high and negotiate down if they can't get funding. What do you feel like are two or three skills that I trained you in Advanced Inner Circle that really elevated you from going from selling the smaller packages to the top, top packages for your industry?
So my top two were like, first of all, disarm the prospect. By connection and sitting doubt in the situation question. And after that, it was like. walking apart. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Because seating doubt, we really, that's where I really teach you about in advanced inner circle. Cause I have to teach you the tone with your questions. Now, give me an example of maybe. So maybe a situation question that we've trained you to ask and how you ask it with your tone that really seeds that doubt. Can you give us an example? So with the situation question, I went a different route because I didn't know English very well. I had to really understand the meaning of the questions and I started with, like, basically what they are doing for a living and what's their job.
Finding out how many hours are they working. and if they have anything that's the person that's a personal training business where you're where they they they work a job as a personal trainer for a gym but they want to start their own In fitness, I was doing that. Because I was asking them if because of their job, they are stressed or are tired. Because Romanians love to complain. It's like a national thing here. And if they... All of them told me like, yeah, it's stress. And I was like, is that affecting your eating habits? And they were like, yes, I don't do nothing. I eat like shit. Yeah. How after that How is that affecting your... Your eating habits being stressed like that. It's that tone, right?
That tone that sneaks doubt in their mind. Now, when I started training you how to use your tone. to see doubt in the prospect's mind, especially in the situation question phase, what did you start noticing? changed within your prospects? What did you start noticing from them? They became more open and they really gave me their real situation. Because before asking... the questions with good tonality, they were like, yeah, I tried to do this. I tried to do that. He's doing great. Yeah and it was like just you know in a battle with them to make them understand that yeah they are not doing something great and not sitting down a lot of sales people what they do is they just use this monotone tone or they'll use like a curious tone every question they ask.
And the prospect doesn't really emotionally open up to that. They'll just give them surface level answers. So now in situation questions, as you know, we're not going to ask the hard questions. Up front, we're typically going to ask two or three that are easier to answer and then go into that, you know, harder emotional question because we have more trust and credibility at that point. But it's all how we see it in our turn. Oh, so you're you're still OK. So you're driving back and forth that way. How is that? affecting like your eating habits. See that soft concern tone seeds doubt, right? Rather than if I'm like, oh, so you're still driving back and forth. How does that affect your eating habits? Oh, you know, it's not that good.
So you just give like a surface level answer. Yeah, perfect. Okay, you talked about disarming the prospect. That's really key. We really teach a lot of advanced techniques in the Inner Struggle program I do for every industry about disarming techniques right when they get on Zoom, if you sell in the home, if you sell... At their company headquarters, if you're selling B2B, if you're selling virtually, if you're selling on the door, on the phone, it doesn't really matter. There's tweaks that we teach for all the different industries. What were some things we taught you for your industry to really disarm them to get them where they just let their guard down? So, for the first thing, for me was to like not be excited on the when I join with them on the call and be like, 'pretty bored' and go straight to the point.
So it was like, 'Hello, Hello, Jeremy.' Can you hear me? Can you see me? All right. So it looks to me that you booked this call with me to look for possible ways to help you lose like 10 kilos. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. Get them in results by saying, you know, I want to make sure I understand. Vlad does not mean like there's a difference between being boring, like where you're just like, 'you're so boring that nobody wants to hear you.' And there's a complete difference in being so excited where you trigger sales resistance because you sound like an overenthusiastic salesperson, right? So there's like a middle ground where you're basically you're communicating like you're the expert. You're the trustee authority. Right.
You're not overly excited, but you're not so boring that you sound weird. Right. So, OK, so it looks like you're still assertive like this. OK, so it looks like you booked on the calendar, I guess, about looking at. You know, possible maybe outside help with. You know, wanting to lose, I think, you know, 10. 10 kilos right maybe a little bit more tone. Okay, kind of even even lower my voice and kind of soften it in that concerned tone when I'm talking about weight. Because weight is a really personal thing. So to really, you know, lose more weight, right? Lower that tone, especially if you're talking to a woman. You really want to lower that tone, that soft concern tone when you're talking about weight. And what did you notice?
Instead of getting on there and saying, 'Hey, how's it going? How you doing? Where do you live?' I love Florida. It's so great. How's the weather there? Because as you know, your prospects don't generally believe. You really care about how their day's going, right? Because every salesperson asks those same predictable questions. You might as well just say, 'Hey, I'm trying to get you to like me so I can sell you my thing.' That's what they're thinking. But what did you notice your prospects started doing when you started getting them into results-based thinking? Yeah, they started to open up more. And also, my calls went from like one hour and 30 to like 35 to 40 minutes. Yeah, that's the difference here. Yeah. So listen to this.
So your calls used to be 90 minutes. And you were closing on average 32 to 37%. Then we train you how to interject, right? When they started going off on tangents. Tell us about interjection. Let's talk about that for a second. Yeah, so this was a very big thing for me because I mastered what I needed to hear from them. The right moment when I got what I needed. i i verbal verbal cue and then bridge into the next question because, with fitness people and also with like business people, like to give the answer, then justify why it's not like a big deal and something and I was like very precision probing with them though to help them not get excuses and to really like keeping them on track.
Yeah, you interject because a lot of times when you ask a question, as you know, those are, you know, those are giving you, you know, they'll start talking the first 30 seconds and it goes into three or four minutes where they're they're just talking about random stuff that had nothing to do with the question you asked. And most salespeople, they're taught just, oh, I got to sit there and listen the whole time. But the problem is, is your prospect's brain getting unorganized? It gets uncertain because it starts going all over the place, then your calls go way overboard. And they're like, 'Hey, I don't have much time. Can you just tell me how much it's going to cost?' Or they just get worn out mentally, like an hour and a half sales call.
That's insane. So hour and a half sales call to get 33, 34% conversions. Then you get up to, I think you said, 85 to 87% and your calls were 35 minutes. So you're almost closing three times the volume. But... you can handle almost three times the sales calls now because your calls are 75% shorter. And I. I didn't do that to do three times the call because I love learning. I was like on the Facebook group. Yeah, six hours a day. Every day in my car, watching, re-watching. Yeah. Well, you have the opportunity to do that now because you have way more time. Like, if you've got five scheduled calls a day and each goes an hour and a half, your day's gone, right?
But if you've got five scheduled calls a day and they're each 35 minutes, you're working like 20 hours a week. You know, maybe 25 at the most, and you've got a lot of time flexibility. And when you're selling three times, almost three times as much, your company is forced to have to pay you more, right? Okay, so... What are some other things, besides disarming the prospect, besides seeding doubt? Maybe give the folks a few other things that we've really trained you in Inner Circle that's really brought this to life for you. Give them some golden nuggets. Yeah, so another thing that was for me was to really master the concern tone with fitness and to help them to open up about their problems, how they are making them feel, for how long, and especially the impact.
Give us an example of that. What's a good question we taught you to use with that concern tone? Yeah, so uh, how I um I already started my problem awareness. It was like, So based on what you told me, I mean, do you lie? What you're what you're doing now to lose weight and especially the results. Eu vim aqui a... Yeah, see how he uses tone there. See, his tone comes across like... It's kind of a little bit like skeptical, but more concerned. And why does that concern tone work so well? Because the prospects are like interpreting the meaning behind behind the words. Yeah. Yeah, and it shows that you're concerned. You have empathy for them, right? That you know something about the things you've tried in the past.
That probably is not that good, but you're not saying it, but you're concerned for them. One thing I'll add to it that you might not have learned yet in Inner Circle. You must have missed this. Training calls is when you lean in, okay, instead of saying 'just do you like' you can lean and say 'so do you I mean, with all these, you know, fitness programs you've done in the past and the weight loss dieting stuff, I mean, do you? Do a hundred percent. Like. The results you've been getting. So that 100% even takes it to a new level. Do you know why? Yeah, because nobody. Yeah. Nobody likes the 100%. I'm using that now in the new offer. Yeah. And it's working great.
I don't feel very good now because that's why I don't join like the life course on the inner circle because I sound way better in Romanian. And in English, I feel like embarrassed of my personality. Oh, it's all right, man. Yeah, like all of our training programs, I believe in... I want to say late 2024. I'm just going to say early 2025, first quarter of 2025. It might be the last quarter of 2024, but I'm always, I just, I don't want to over promise here. So, you know, early quarter of 2025, you know, most with AI. They should be able to get into the virtual training programs if they're a client and be able to pick the language they want me to train them in. Like Romania.
So it's about 95% accurate, even the tonality, even the lip movements and everything. But the cultural stuff's a little bit different, right? But you guys know your culture better than us. But the words... the questions, the tone with AI, it's about 95% there. So it's pretty cool. Everybody will pick the language, Spanish, French, Romanian, Czech, Polish. You know, Portuguese, whatever you guys speak, Mongolian, you know, Chinese, whatever, Taiwanese, and it'll be there. It's pretty awesome. We even have it there for you guys that are in Australia. Australian language. I'm just joking. I had to throw that to some of my Aussies on our team. OK, so that's really important because when you ask that question, a lot of people say, 'No,' gosh, 'no.' Or they'll say, 'Well.' I mean, I wouldn't say it's a hundred percent and you got to say not a hundred percent.
I could say not a hundred percent now. If right there at that second, you always want to pause about two seconds. Okay. Because when you have your hand on your chest, hold on, not 100%. Yeah, oh gosh. The other day and they'll tell you something they don't like, or they'll just kind of pause and they're like, 'Yeah,' there's some things I don't like, and then you gotta say, 'Oh, what don't you like?' So there's like a little thing you have to do there to make sure. But you're right— nobody likes 100% of anything they have. I always give the analogy when I do a keynote or something. Think about the person you're dating or that you're married to. You know, the first two or three months, you thought they were perfect.
You literally thought they were the angels from on high. They could do no wrong. And then six months later, after the honeymoon phase was over, you started seeing stuff that maybe you didn't like. And they did too, right? So we as human beings, we'd never like anything 100%. There's always something we want better or something to change. That's why that 100% right there is so good. That's a really good way to build the gap. What else? Give us a couple other things that we've really taught you that's really elevated your game. Yeah, so, so a very big thing for me was to prevent objections because it was very, very hard. For me, selling in Romania. Because the program that I was selling is like five times the...
the price of the average income in Romania. So I really had to prevent almost all the objections. Yeah. So you're talking about pre-framing. So give us an example of maybe an objection in your industry that before an APQ, you would get a lot. At the end. But now you've learned how to kind of pre-frame that so you get that far less. So the first one that I was able to... to pre-handle was do it by myself because they were like, after the price, not having the skills, they were like, 'I'm just gonna do it myself.' So I which is crazy. I want to say this, which is crazy to think about, right? Because if they could do it themselves, they would have already solved it.
So you know, and I know, and everybody knows on here, the verprosophic gives you that objection. Obviously, they don't know how to do it themselves. Otherwise, they would have never been on the call. They would have been able to solve it. Keep going. Yeah. So the way I did that was by the rationale and how I did it was like, okay, I understood, but let me see the rationale. So, um, besides your... You're wanting us to help you to lose that 15 kilos and really put together the meal plan for you because everybody else comes to us for this reason. And what's like the... What's like the main theme? or for you coming to professional health, rather than like...
I don't know, start doing everything on your own, like doing the research, everything, like get accountability by, I don't know, some family members. Why looking for professional help in the first place? Yes, and what would they say? Yes, I'm not able to do it by myself. I tried in the past and I didn't stick with it. Yes. And at the end, it's impossible for them to say, I think I'm just going to do it myself. So that's the rationale question. It does twofold. It's really good. That's in the problem awareness stage, problem awareness questions in APQ. We're like, okay, so just so I can see the rationale, but, you know, besides you're going to repeat back the thing they said they wanted. Or a problem, okay.
So, besides you just you know wanting help, losing the the 15 kilos, I guess. What's the main reason why you're looking for kind of an outside help to come in and help you do this, rather than just, I don't know, trying to go through like basic YouTube videos and try to figure all of it out on your own? You know, but it's the way you say that, rather than just trying to, I don't know, just go through like some basic YouTube videos and see if your family can help you and try to figure, I don't know, all of it out on your own. Now, if I said, rather than just, you know, trying to figure it out on your own. With that tone, it doesn't do anything.
Rather than just, I don't know, trying to figure all of it out on your own. See, that sounds hard, the way I said it with my tone. But my tone, it seeded what? When you say it like that, what does it seed in their brain? It is a lot of doubt and they remind themselves that they tried a lot of times in the past and they didn't succeed. And what NEPQ learned me is to never like... uh, trust what they are saying and always watch on their behind their actions and they are on the call with me of course they cannot do you know Yeah. On their own. It's so true. I always say, you know, with NAPQ, with listening, active listening, we're listening to what the prospect means, not just what they say.
Those are two very different things. Your prospect, listen to what they mean. Their tone. We teach how to read tonality and body language. Don't listen to just what they say. So very different things. What have you learned from that? Yeah, so I learned to, by being able to listen to them, I learned to like... identify non-viral language, let's say. Yeah and when they are telling me they want to thrive, they want to like they Hmm. They want to have. I was like, you want to try or you really need to? Hold on. You want to try to lose weight or do you actually want to lose the weight and then keep it off where it doesn't come back? See how we do that? That's a comparative frame.
Now, when we've taught you how to do comparative frames, how do your prospects respond to that? Uh, I see them like how you say a deer in the headlight— like all their like way of thinking just like instantly change. Yeah. Yeah. All you just did there, Vlad, is you reframed their way of thinking. And that's a salesperson's job. I always hear salespeople, they'll come up to me at the end of an event. They're obviously not clients. If they're clients, no client. Never ask me these questions because they already know what to do. But if they're not clients and maybe they're just following me, watching some basic, you know, 60-second reels on IG or, you know, a few YouTube videos here.
There, because that's just it—because that's basic content we're not going to release all the advanced stuff that's in our courses for clients. But they always will come up to me and uh, you know, they'll be like, 'Well, you know, I try to ask questions that I learn on your reels, but sometimes they say, 'What am I supposed to say after?' I'm like, 'Well, you just haven't learned how to frame.' The question, like, because your prospects—I always say this every objection you get, as you know— every objection you get. Every prospect who procrastinates, every prospect who doesn't start with what you're offering, who doesn't buy what you're offering, comes down to the core being of human beings that every human being has a fear of change.
Every human being, we have a fear of change. Even though we say we like change, we have a fear of change. Why? Because we're afraid of the unknown. We are actually much more comfortable with something that is familiar to us, even though we don't like it that much, over something that is new. something that is foreign to us. So every prospect you talk to, Vlad, as you know, and anybody listening or watching this, especially if you're watching this on YouTube, or maybe you're listening to this on the podcast. They have a core fear of change. It's your job as a sales pro to help them overcome that fear of change. Now, once you learn the skills, the questions, the tone, and the body language to do that, as Vlad will tell you, well, selling becomes pretty easy, right?
87% closing percentages. If you don't learn those skills, but I'll also tell you what. Selling is a lot harder. You go through a lot of the numbers game. You don't get paid that much by your company because you're not producing, right? So when we do that comparative frame that he just did, it instantly reframes their way of thinking from 'like, oh, you know, victim mentality.' I'll try it. I'll try to do this. Hold on. And it makes you appear like what, Vlad? In their eyes, what does it make you appear like in their eyes when you kind of challenge them a little bit? Yeah, like an expert. And because I'm with them through the problem awareness and helping them to find problems. Thank you. Thank you.
Although those problems are impacting them, I'm there for them. Yeah, I'm like a caring expert. I'm there for them and I—I'm the expert that can get them the results. How they view you now, Vlad, is they view you as a higher status. So they view you at a higher status with what you're talking about. About fitness, than they are much higher status, okay. Whereas most sales people in industry are viewed in society as a lower status, right, because of the way they communicate. You're viewed as the expert, the trusted authority who can get them the results. Hold on. John. Do you want to try to lose weight or do you actually? I want to learn how to lose the weight. Where it never actually comes back. So those are two very different things.
Which path do you want to go down? See how I lowered my tone? Into that concerned tone. And what do they do? Yeah, they start to reframe their whole way of thinking and they start to... ¡Toc! They start to pull themselves. in their future state and to really like think but most importantly act like the person they want to become. So true. Yeah. So you're getting them out of that victim mentality, or you could even say price or cost-based thinking into results-based thinking, just simply by asking that. question, I'm reframing them into a different, a different emotional level, like where they, they start to realize, Hey. I can actually, in your industry, lose this weight and keep it off. I just need the right person to help me with this.
I need the right trainer to do this with me, okay? And that's a night and day difference. Man, congratulations on your success. I didn't know your closing percentages went from 32% to 35% to 87%. That's a bit of a difference. Has your company been forced to pay you more? Yeah, so after they saw my results, the guy that I was selling for, like, shared my results in, like, an entrepreneur's group. And they were, like, coming to me. Uh, the next month, one guy on fitness because he saw that I saw—I outsold his like I don't know nine closers. Uh, by myself, he he paid me way much than my commission just to like train their team. Yeah. it was great, and now I'm selling on this offer, and my commissions are like 2.
5 x what I have before in fitness. Well, well, well done. Congratulations with what, what they're having to pay you now. Sounds like you can, you can have a pretty good lifestyle, especially there in Romania. Is it, what's it changed for you? Not even financially, but what's it changed for you in your life? Uh, so for me, in my life, it's like the most important thing is like I can I love to help people because uh, when I was young, my father was like helpless, and I want to help them to not be in that position, and I saw like with the clients that I'm bringing in, they are way more responsible, they are having better results after the after the The cell, they are like thanking me, putting me in their prayers and...
It's amazing for me to see that because the results are... are amazing, but Romania is like... 10 times cheaper than the US. Yeah. And I kind of feel like a ninja in here because I feel like with the other sales techniques that like they are in the Stone Age and like I'm here with like some... You're like in the Matrix. You're like the Matrix guy wherever like the bullets are like... Going by you, slower, you can see everybody's move— 10 steps ahead, whereas all that are sales people, you know, in your country, using the older techniques, or you know, they're just kind of struggling and frustrated when they don't have to be, 'doggone it.' We gotta, we gotta get a bigger presence in Romania.
I was in Europe for about a month this summer. And I was surprised, you know, in Italy. I was in Sicily, Rome, and Venice, and I got stopped every day by at least four or five people just walking around the city or at dinner. Oh, you know, we follow you. A client or whatever. Then I went to Prague. Same thing, even more in Prague. I guess we have more clients in Czech Republic. I've no idea. Just walking down the streets. Poland was the same thing, but I've got to get over, got to get over to Romania for sure. Just let me know—I'm gonna be your tour guide and Yeah. Squeeze a lot of, yeah, squeeze as much information as I can because you learn me the questions.
Yeah, I come to Europe every summer. So there's a client that I meet there. So I've met him three summers in a row. He lives in Norway. His name's Michael Kutkowski. I've interviewed him once on my podcast, but he's now— the number one life insurance or the number one actually insurance salesperson in all of Norway and all of Scandinavia. So every summer we have a tradition that he flies down to Poland because it's only like an hour flight from Oslo. And we hang out for a couple of days. So I'm going to invite you next time to fly from Romania to Poland, not very far from you. And you can hang out with us. It's a lot of fun. Yeah, call them convenience. All right. All right, baby. Awesome.
Congratulations on your results. Any last words of advice you'd give to maybe a new person that's looking to get into sales or maybe even a vet about how they get better? Yeah, so for me, it was like the life-changing moment when I really decided on that day to go all in and not have excuses. And what you learned me the most is to... Whenever I don't have to use like my mind fully 100% focus on one thing to just learn and learn and learn, I'm like on the on the groups like eight eight hours a day. Yeah. It's a game changer, you know, and the important thing is, you know, like I like I tell all the inner circle clients when we.
because they have access to our main portal that's like 51 hours of training, but then they have access to the group sessions every week. With myself, the four group sessions a week. And not everybody attends every one, right? Because they're on sales calls and stuff, but they have the archives. They're going through the recordings all the time from each week. And we track that. We track like how many times they go through the portal. We track how many times they're on the live Zoom sessions. We even track how many times they go through the archive sessions because we can see all that data. and it's a 90 difference in the results, like the the clients who are in there going through the archives you know, recording training like once or twice, so they'll be on the live one
or they'll miss a live one and they'll go and even if they go to the live one they're still going to listen to the recording that another one or two times because they retain more each time. Right. Those clients far outsell clients who maybe go through the portal half of it in a year and get on two training calls in a year. It's just like they're not committed to changing. They might sell 10, 15, 20% more, but they're not like tripling or quadrupling their closing percentage because it takes effort, right? Why is it so important for you to put in that effort? Because you didn't have to. Because I'm very competitive. That's why I don't go to like the live calls because I sound amazing in Romanian when I hear myself in English.
It's like a big difference. I have to get past through that. But because there is so much depth to the information, I mean. When I was first on, uh, watching an inner circle like when you were like analyzing a guy like seven words for like five minutes was like, okay, I I don't know, I have to I have to learn more and there's so much to eat. I mean, we get very nuanced in there. You're right. Like, I'll take a whole sentence that they just. I'm like, okay, can you see how you triggered this? His reaction, because we do call reviews where I can hear what they did on the call or a Zoom or even in person.
They'll record it and then I'll break down each sentence where I'm like, 'Okay, when you said, 'Hey, you know, welcome to the call, grateful for you to be on here, thank you for taking your time to to be here with me today. I know you have a busy schedule. I'm like, you probably thought that was really polite, didn't you? Yeah, I did. That just lowered your status.' In the prospect's brain, because when you say things like, 'Thank you for the opportunity to take your time to meet with me because I know you have a really busy schedule, that implies in your mind that that prospect has a much higher status than you, that their time should be respected, but not your time. So if they don't respect your time, they don't respect you.
You're just another salesperson trying to sell them something. While Vlad, they respect his time because now they view him at a higher status with what he's talking about. And they view him as like the authority or the expert that can solve their problems and get them where they want to go. And as you know, Vlad, I always say people buy from salespeople and companies that they feel. who they trust. can get them the best result. It has not hardly anything to do if they like you. Like you like a lot of people. But it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to buy from them just because you like them. You might like your best friend. But you're not buying from him or her because you don't trust they can get you the best result.
You might buy from a stranger on a sales call, because after 30 minutes you trust they can get you a much better result, and you don't even hardly know them. That's the obvious, all right. Vlad, congratulations, well done. I'll have my assistant reach out to you a couple months before I come over to Europe. Uh, next summer, and we'll make sure we we get you together with some of our other clients that I meet up with every summer over there. Okay. I can wait for the next summer. Now, I'm a winter guy, but... Summer, I think, will be my favorite season. I go to Europe. I go to Europe every every month, every every summer for a month, because it's it's hot here. We're headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona.
So June, July, August are really hot. So I try to get out of town about five to six weeks every summer and I go over to Europe. So it's a lot of fun. And you probably don't know this, but we're— opening up our international, our European headquarters— in London the second week of January. So I'll actually be over in London probably about three times a year, but I'll be working over there a lot more in the summers for sure. It's nice. It's like a two-hour, two-hour ride. Yeah, that's right, baby. All right, everybody. Love you. Thanks, Vlad. Go to bed. I know it's late over there. Thanks, everybody. Hope you enjoyed this. And if you, hey, if you want to.
