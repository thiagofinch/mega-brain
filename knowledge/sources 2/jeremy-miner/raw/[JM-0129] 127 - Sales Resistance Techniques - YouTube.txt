127 - Sales Resistance Techniques - YouTube.mp4
What I started noticing is that the more I looked, acted, and talked like a salesperson, the more resistant I was getting from the prospect. So I started thinking, even in those days, I was about 22 at that point, how do I reduce that resistance? Competing with that in the first minute. Because if you're competing with sales resistance in the very first minute, it's so hard to overcome that. You're just competing with objections the whole time. It just makes selling so stressful when it doesn't have to be. So how do I reduce resistance? So as a door-to-door salesperson, which is going to be different than if you're selling to a boardroom meeting, it's a little bit different there. But what I started doing is I'm like, okay.
Instead of wearing all these nice clothes that my sales manager taught me I should wear and like nice watches and jewelry, because that just smells like what? Salesperson. Salesy. Yeah, salesy. How do I get them to view me not as a salesperson, even in my wardrobe? So I'm like, okay, what I'm going to do is I bought like a $10 Walmart watch because I didn't have any money anyways. It wasn't like I was wearing a fancy watch, but I bought like a $10 Walmart watch. I remember I put a tape measure. On my side of my pants, I wore just cargo khakis. I wore white New Balance grandpa shoes. You know what I'm talking about? The white New Balance. Like when you become grandpa, you start wearing the white New Balance because you want the cover.
I started wearing those as a 22-year-old. Okay, just a regular polo shirt, very basic, had the company logo on there. Then I'm like, 'Okay, what other things can I do I got a metal clipboard like this with like a survey thing on it. They think I'm more like a meter reader. And then I went and got a lime green and an orange construction vest. I'm not kidding when I say this. And just that. Alone. When they came to the door, lowered resistance because they didn't view me as a salesperson trying to sell them something. So instead of being up in their grill like I was, I was more back and I was sitting here, looking around the home, you know, kind of looking around, like I'm doing a survey, and they come, they're like, 'Hey, how can I help you and I'm like, 'Yeah, are you guys the...
Are you guys the... the homeowners here?' very like confused, like, 'Yeah, yeah, we're the homeowners. What's going on?' immediately, instead of like triggering sales resistance that most sales people do in the first 10 seconds, I'm triggering curiosity, okay? Just that alone, man. I could go into a lot more, but just that alone, right there, almost, I call it the confused old man. Because when you hear a confused old man, what do you want to do? You want to help. You want to help, right? You want to help the confused old man. So just by that. Lowered sales resistance by 80– 90%. And then, if you have the right questions to ask at the right time, you trigger every more curious. One thing we all have to understand.
This is just Behavioral Science 101. Within the first 7 to 12 seconds of any sales interaction you are involved in, whether that's... Door-to-door, whether that's on a cold call to a company, whether that's presenting to a board of directors, whether that's in a home selling B2C or an inbound lead, you're setting here like we are on Zoom. Your prospects, subconsciously,— we cannot even help it, the way our brain works— are already picking up social cues from you. They're picking up on your verbal and nonverbal and your body language cues from your tonality and what you were saying and or asking that triggers their brain to react. This is scary if we don't understand this. React in one of two ways, okay?
So if we come across an aggressive, overly assumptive, or needy person, you know what I mean by needy, right? You can tell when the salesperson needs the deal, right? Hey, do you have two minutes of your time where I can take? Nobody believes you. One thing we all have to understand: This is just Behavioral Science 101. Within the first 7 to 12 seconds of any sales interaction you are involved in, whether that's... Door-to-door, whether that's on a cold call to a company, whether that's presenting to a board of directors, whether that's in a home selling beat, see, or an inbound lead, you're setting here like we are on Zoom. Your prospects subconsciously we cannot even help it— the way our brain works are already picking up social cues from you.
They're picking up on your verbal and nonverbal and your body language cues from your tonality and what you were saying and/ or asking. That triggers their brain to react. This is scary if we don't understand this. React in one of two ways, okay? So if we come across aggressive, overly assumptive, needy, you know what I mean by 'needy,' right? You can tell when the salesperson needs the deal, right? Hey, do you have two minutes of your time where I can take? Nobody believes you're only going to take two minutes of time. You're needy. And you come across attached. and you don't know the right questions to ask, it triggers the brain to go into what we call fight or flight mode. You've heard of fight or flight mode, right?
Sure, absolutely. Everybody has, but does anybody know what triggers fight or flight mode? Most people don't. And as a salesperson, you probably want to understand what triggers fight or flight mode so you eliminate that, so you don't trigger fight or flight mode. Because then you're just competing against the great wall of China, I call it. It's like the great wall of objections you have to then break down. I'd rather not have a wall at all. I'd rather just have complete openness, so I can do that. So that's where the prospect, when you trigger fight or flight mode, as everybody knows, they do what? They get defensive? Mm-hmm. That's fight mode. Or a flight mode is they try to get rid of you. And they say things like that.
Oh, I forgot about the appointment. Hey, I'm too busy. Can you call me back later? Oh, yeah, call me back Saturday night at 10 p. m. Okay, I'll call you back Saturday. And then they never answer, right? Or, you know, after all, we just don't need it. We're good. We already used somebody for that. How much is this going to cost me within the first 30 seconds? You're triggering that, okay? Now, once you learn how to work with human behavior, okay, we call that neuroemotional persuasion questions. It stands for NEPQ. And you learn how to come across more neutral in your conversations. Now, when I say neutral, that means you're unbiased. You're not quite sure if you can even help yet. How how could you even know if you could help?
For example, if somebody comes to you and they say, 'Hey Jeremy, I appreciate you.' Let's say you're going in front of a boardroom meeting. And they're like, 'Hey, Jeremy, this sounds really good.' Somebody you haven't even met yet, a decision maker. You've met with three or four other decision makers. Now you're coming in, there's eight. Four of them don't even know who you are. And they're like, 'Hey, we already use a vendor for this. Why should we go with you?' What would most salespeople say when they heard that? What do you think they would say? Yeah, they start going, 'Oh, we're the best at this.' Well, you should go with us because we've been ranked the number one in customer service and JD Associates ranked us, and our clients are this, this, and this.
That's why you should go with us and our competitors. it's in one ear out the other because why because every salesperson says that so they just associate you with everyone else trying to stuff their solution down their throat that's ever tried to sell them something so what i want to do is i want to Disarm that person. I want them to let their guard down. Because if I can get them to let their guard down, then they become open to what I'm offering. If I can't... very hard to make a sale. okay or it just prolongs the sales cycle by 10 times okay so they say something like that I'm just gonna lean back and say well I'm not quite sure that you... Should yet. Yeah.
You know, we'd have to understand a little bit more about what you're using right now in XYZ area just to see if we could even help. Because there's some firms where there's just not much we can do for them, and they're sometimes better off staying with who they already have. So for example, we need to understand, and then boom. I want you to watch when you do that. the body language and the demeanor of the prospect when you say well Why should we go with you? Well... I'm not quite sure that you... Should ya? You pause two or three seconds and they're going to be like. You can just tell that it just, you take over the status in that room because experts and authorities don't need. the sale.
They already have all these clients that are getting results. They don't need you. In fact, when you do that, it's almost like they view you much differently. They're like, 'Whoa, okay, maybe I should listen to this person.' He doesn't seem needy. Because when you feel that somebody's needy, let's say you're single and you're chasing after somebody you're really interested in. You just keep chasing them in the beginning. What do they typically do? They run! But if you act like you don't need them... What do they typically do? Yeah, then they're all over you, I think. They start to pull you in more. It's the same thing in sales. I don't know why nobody's putting that together yet. It's just human psychology 101.
