123 - When Your Competitor is Cheaper - Sales Objection - YouTube.mp4
So how do you close a sale when one of your competitors undercuts you? Let's say that you gave the prospect a proposal with different quotes in it and they're also getting different quotes and bids from some of your competition. And they say something like this to you. They say, 'First of all, go down to the bottom of this video, hit the subscribe button. That's probably important for you. Hit the subscribe button. And to the right of that, or maybe the left, I don't know, somewhere in there, there's like a little bell. That's your notifications button.' Hit the notifications button as well so you get notified by YouTube every time I post a new training video, which I typically do two to four times a week.
They say, 'Hey, you know, XYZ company gave us a quote that's cheaper than yours.' Can you give us a better price? Now, instead of just... giving them a better price, where they commoditize you now, and now they're going to go back and forth and negotiate you down. You want to get the prospect thinking results-based thinking rather than price. or cost-based thinking. So here's how you do it. I'm going to give you a generic example of how to start that conversation. And then at the end, I'm going to show you how it works in like an... Industry-specific example so you can see the framework that we're using. Hey, can you give me a cheaper price? Like the company XYZ gave us a lower bid or a lower cost.
or a lower proposal. First of all, you want to find out what that quote actually is and what it's actually for. So you do it like this. Yeah, not a problem. Can I ask what quote they gave you and for what specifically? Now, why do you want to ask that question? Because you have to realize a lot of your prospects just lie to you. They might not have even met with one of your competitors. They might be just saying that. To try to get you to come down on your price. So you have to understand that. If they can't show you the quote or the proposal, then you know that that's probably what they're doing. Now, so let me go through this again. Yeah, that's not a problem.
Can I ask what quote they gave you and for what specifically, just so I have a better understanding? Well, yeah, they said it's going to be this. This for A, B, C, or for D, F, and G. Ah, okay. Can you go through the proposal with me specifically just so I understand? Because, you know, maybe you're... better off going with them. That disarms a prospect where they're open to going through what that company proposed to them, so you know exactly what you're dealing with. That way, you're not guessing, throwing mud against the wall, hoping and praying that something you're going to say is going to stick with them and they're going to buy, okay? Now, here's where we start to get them thinking results-based thinking.
I'm going to move this up here for you, okay? Yeah, they gave us, you know, X, Y, Z cost for A, B, and C. And you find out specifically what the cost is and what it was for. Then you say this. Well, it really just depends on what type of results that you actually want. I mean, is price the most important thing to you, or solving the problem and actually getting the result you want? Now, what did I just do there? When I said, 'Now is price the most important thing to you, or actually solving the problem and getting the result you want?' Is price the most important thing to you? Look at my hands. Is price the more... important thing to you, or actually solving the problem and getting the result you want?
See how I'm using my hands? Price-based thinking, results-based thinking. That question... flips their mind, where they start thinking about the result, the end result, not the price. You don't want your prospect thinking of the price, because then you're going to get commoditized with everybody else. Impede on price. You want to be able to get them thinking results-based thinking, because every salesperson in your industry doesn't know how to do that, like I'm showing you how to do it, all right? Now, they're going to say, 'Well, yeah, I want the results.' But if we can, they might say, 'Yeah, I mean definitely the results more important' or they might say, 'Well, I mean we definitely want the result, but you know price is important, too Or they might say, 'We definitely want the result' but you know, if we can get a better price, that would be good.
Then you can say, 'If they say that, you're gonna go here.' I'm gonna show you this. Can I, yeah, that's not a problem. Can I make a suggestion to you? This is after you've seen the quote and the proposal, you know what it is. What they quoted you is for X, Y, and Z. Which actually only does A, B, and C. Now, I'm being generic for a reason. You have to plug in that gap. Now, we could give you that exact same quote for that. Like I said, it just depends on the end result that you want. So let me go over that again. What they quoted you is for X, Y, Z, which only does A, B, and C.
So now you're getting them to think, 'Oh, maybe the company that gave me a cheaper quote is not going to give me the result that I really want.' See, that seeds doubt in their mind. Then you agree. Now, hey, we could give you the exact same quote for that too, but, like I said, it just depends. On the type of result that you want. Now, what does that give them thinking again? Results-based thinking rather than price-based thinking. Now, I'm going to give you an industry-specific example just so you can see what happens at this point. Let's say that you sold home improvement. Okay, and let's say that you sold windows. Okay, like I said, we train every industry on planet Earth.
I'm just going to show you one example because we don't have much time in this reel or post that you're watching me. All right? We could, I mean, we could install these cheaper XYZ windows that they quoted you. You would just end up having to replace them in maybe five, seven years once they start wearing down, and your utility bills will stay the same. So we could give you the same quote for the cheapest windows if you want. Now, we could also put in, here's where you're going to give them an alternative. We could also put in the mid-range window that would last a bit longer, maybe 10, 12 years, and it would cut your utility by whatever percentage. Percentage, 10%. I'm just going to throw something. I don't know.
It depends on the state you live in for that industry. So you're giving them options. Now, we could also put in the mid-range window that would last a bit longer, maybe 10 to 12 years, and cut your utility bound by X, Y, Z percentages. Here's where you get them back to the original proposal you had. Or we could completely solve the problems you mentioned and put in the ABC windows. Now, you want to mention those problems. Okay, let's say... windows they had a problem with cold air coming in their infant's room at night and the infant would wake up and then mom and dad have to wake up and they're druggie at work and they their lives because they're always having to get up because it's so cold in their infant's room.
That could be their problem. Plus their utility bills are high because of that and they're overpaying. So maybe that's their problem. problem that you bring out of it. I mean, we could completely solve the problem where there was no cold draft coming into your daughter's room. You know, we could do that and we could put in the ABC windows that you said you originally wanted, those are gonna last the 20 to 25 years, and that would cut your utility bill down by, I'm just making up a number. 30% so the question is so you give them the three options. Results-based thinking so the question is really: if you thought about it, which is really more expensive?
Is it more expensive to get the extra funds to put in for the windows that last the longest, increase the value of your home, and cut your utility bill down by X, Y, Z percentages, or... Is it more expensive? Let me go this here. Or is it more expensive to put in the cheap windows that don't really last that long, the cold air still comes into your daughter's room at night, and you end up having to replace the windows again in five years anyway? Like, if you thought about it... Which is really more expensive. Okay. What did we just do there? We got the prospect again at the end to think more results-based thinking over price or cost-based thinking. Does that make sense? I want you to do that next time.
Now, I just gave you a formula in the beginning of that for, let me go back here. Da-da-da-da-da. This crazy whiteboard here. So I just gave you the formula. That you can use for any industry here in the beginning. And then at the end, I showed you an industry-specific example. So you want to watch this a couple of times and write that down, write that formula for your specific product or industry. Industry that you actually sell in. I want you to do that next time a competitor comes in and undercuts you. The prospect says, 'Hey, you know, we got a proposal or a bid from X. company that's cheaper than yours, can you give us a better deal?
Can you give us a better price?' Rather than you just dropping down where your company loses tons of money, you lose a ton of commissions, if you take them through that formula and get them to think results-based thinking over price-based thinking, they will always pay you more than your competitors. Because you've got them to more focus on the end result than the price or the cost, because they start to view at the end that it's actually more expensive by going with. The cheaper option from another competitor than it is to go with a higher-based option that completely solves their problems and gets them an adult they want, and they'll gladly pay you more for that. Try that next time and see how that works for you.
