62 - The #1 Reason You Sound SCRIPTED (And How to Stop) - YouTube.mp4
All right, today I'm going to show you the number one reason why you sound scripted in your prospect's brain. Come over to the vibe board. This is something you don't want to miss because if you're getting a lot of objections, especially in the first couple minutes of a conversation, it's because you're triggering sales resistance, all right? Now, here is why. I'm going to show you first. Why do you sell? Scripted okay. Why is this happening? All right. One of the biggest reasons why is you've been taught to ask questions on a script, or maybe if you're selling in person, you've got your script memorized, or you might be in the office or whatever you're at home. So you've got the script, you know, mailed to your computer or whatever you taped up there and you're reading it.
And it's not necessarily because you're reading it. It's because you don't sound conversational. OK, so a lot of you have been trained. And look, I realize it's not your fault. You're trained that way. That it is your what? It is your problem, right? And I'm going to help you overcome that. So a lot of you ask questions. You've been taught to listen. And at the end, what you do after they answer the questions, you're like, 'Okay, cool.' Right, right. Or you say like, okay, cool, awesome. Or, okay, gotcha, gotcha. Or, oh, that's great. Okay, okay, let me ask you. Or you mirror them. A lot of you have been taught, I got to mirror them. So if they say something, what I think I heard you say is, and then you repeat it back.
The issue with mirroring, I'm going to talk about this for a second, is I want you to think about this for a second, okay? When you're talking with your best friend, when you're talking with a relative that you already trust and they trust you. Do you peep back? What they said to them? Do you repeat that back? Do you mirror them? You don't. And you don't because that would sound unnatural. The problem is you're doing that with prospects and they're human as well. And it causes you to sound unnatural because that's not how a natural conversation goes. Now, you don't want it to sound scripted, of course. You don't want to wing it either. It's got to be a skilled conversation, but it's got to be a way where the prospect feels like they are already know you, that you're trustworthy, all those things.
So be careful about mirroring. If you're going to use it, use it here and there sparingly. Don't use it that often in a conversation. It does not work that well. Okay. And then, right here, when we put in these filler words, after they tell us the answer, whatever to your question, this is because your brain is searching. What do I say next? You're like, 'Okay, cool. Awesome.' Let me ask you, when you're searching for the next question. The problem is, is that doesn't sound natural in the prospect's brain. Because if they're talking to one of their friends, their friends don't do this because they already know what to say next because they already know where to go. That's why you sound scripted. Now, I'm going to show you how to overcome that.
Now, that's one way. I'm going to show you two other reasons why you sound scripted to your prospect. So what we're going to do is we're going to use what are called verbal cues. I kid you not. And verbal cues, you're going to bridge from question to question. This is called bridging. Okay. So how do I make a conversation conversational? Because you're going to bridge from question to question using verbal cues. Now, what are verbal cues? I'm going to have you write these down. I'm going to give you a few examples here, okay? Now, there's two reasons, two ways I use verbal cues. The first reason is when they're talking, I'm using little words like, uh-huh. Ah. Really? Now I'm exaggerating. You're not going to do that every two seconds, but about every, let's say, seven to 10 seconds.
Okay. Depending on the context, when they're talking, I'm going to say. Hmm. Right. Okay. I see. Now, like I said, you're not going to use them every two seconds. I'm exaggerating. Every about 7, 10, 12 seconds, you're going to use a verbal cue. Now, I listed eight here. In our courses, we probably listen to 200, all right? Now, here's what I'm doing. There's reasons why. Number one, it sounds like to the prospect you're actually listening to them. So you're present in the conversation. Have you ever been on a phone call with somebody and you sit and talk for like two minutes straight and they don't make a sound? What do you do? Hey, are you still there? It's because you can't tell if they were present because you didn't hear anything out of their mouth.
Okay. Now, the second reason is, like I said, you use them to bridge from question to question. I'm going to show you some examples right after this. Pay attention to what I'm about to show you. This could literally make or break deals you're losing. Like you should be making these deals right now that you're losing on big reasons because you don't know how to bridge from question to question yet. Yet, as I said, yet, that sounds, that makes it sound and feel like the prospect that it's a real conversation, not a sales conversation, right? Now, verbal cues, once again, show imprisonment in conversation, causes you to sound natural, not scripted, okay? Now, what does that do? Why is that important for you to sound natural? Because it causes the prospect to let their guard down.
Okay, now, one thing you want to understand, this is just behavioral science 101. Your prospect. So every human being on this planet has built up what are called defensive mechanisms in their survival part of their brain. A lot of scientists would call that the reptilian part of the brain or survival part of the brain. Okay. So anytime you feel or a prospect feels like they're being sold to, that comes from like the tongue. The body language, the words, if your words sound like most salespeople send them anything, that's triggering their brain to go into what's called fight. Okay, so fight. or flight mode. OK, you ever had a telemarketer salesperson call you? Hey, John. There. Hey, John, it's James Miller with XYZ Company. Hey, the reason why I'm calling you was now.
instantly, where does your brain go? Either fight, you're like not interested and you get defensive. Or flight mode. Hey, I'm really busy. Can you call me back later? That's what is triggering your brain, based off the tonality of that salesperson or the words or both. If you sound like every salesperson has ever tried to sell them, you're using the same words, verbiage, and your tone sounds monotone like a telemarketer or sounds way high-pitched. Like a really excited salesperson or even worse. Timid, like a really salesperson that doesn't sell that much, you're automatically going to trigger this and they're going to try to get rid of you. Okay. So I want to use verbal cues in that conversation to get the prospect to let their guard down rather than the guard up.
And that helps them open up emotionally in that conversation. Because how many of your prospects open up emotionally to you and tell you everything? If their guard's up. None of them do. And it's hard to make a sale if their guard's up, okay? Now, Let me show you a few examples of verbal cues. Remember, I'm going to show you how to bridge from question to question now in this example. Let's say you sell for a marketing agency. You're a salesperson, and let's say this company is maybe they're not getting enough leads through their own efforts. Maybe the leads they get are not very good. Okay. I'm just taking whatever they say. And now you're going to ask questions before this. These would be what we call 'situation questions.' Okay.
I'm helping them find out what their real situation is. So I've already asked what we call 'connection questions.' Okay. They're guards down. So they've already told me some things that I'm like, 'Oh, okay.' And what are, what are you doing now to, to generate new leads and clients? Ah, and what are you, see, ah, that's a verbal cue. See how I'm bridging. So if the last question I asked them, so let's say there was a book call, they show up on Zoom. And what were you hoping could happen by possibly working with us? Well, I'm hoping that we can get better leads and blah, blah, blah. Ah, okay. And what are you doing now to generate new leads and clients though? See how I bridge. Ah, okay. Ah, okay.
What are you doing now? That's a verbal cue. Now, most salespeople after that first question and answer would say, 'Okay, cool.' Yeah, it sounds like you need good qualified leads then. Right, right. Let me ask you, what are you doing now? See. It sounds scripted. sounds like a salesperson. But if they're like, 'Ah, we want qualified leads.' Ah, okay. And what are you doing now to generate new leads and clients though? See, I'm bridging quick. Ah, okay. And what are you doing? Boom. Right into the question keeps the prospects guard down okay. Oh, we do this we do that okay. And how long have you been running ads on Facebook oh we've been running okay we do ads on Facebook, YouTube. Ah, okay.
And how long have you been running ads on Facebook and YouTube though? Huh? That's a verbal cue. See how I'm bridging into the next question. Guard stays down because it sounds conversational. See what we're doing here? Oh, we've been running ads on Facebook for the past five years. Okay, what? What caused you to go that route rather than... All the other options out there, though. Oh, okay. What caused you to go that route rather than all the other options out there? See, oh, okay. And what, see, that's a verbal cue. See, I'm bridging from question to question. Now, if I could show you a role play, if I had someone in the office, I'd show you this, how this works, okay? Now, one thing you can do.
I think I have some videos on here actually, role play. So after this, uh, search for those, maybe I'll find those for you, okay? Now, verbal pausing. This is just as important as bridging from question to question using verbal cues, okay? When I verbal pause, what that means is it causes the prospect to pay attention to what I'm about to say. It causes their brain to hone into the next words I'm about to say, okay? That triggers what? curiosity. Okay, it also causes them to think deeper about what you're asking or what you're saying. Think about some of the most famous speeches you've ever heard in your life. Maybe Martin Luther King, the 'I Have a Dream' speech. And I don't have it word for word.
But think about all the verbal pauses he did in that speech. What if he said that really fast? What if? Actually, I'm going to show you. So he said something like this. I might be. Off on a few words. I have a dream. That one day, all men and women will be created equal, not based on their skin color. But by the X, Y, Z. Now, that was four verbal pauses. I have a dream. Pause. That one day. Pause. See? Now, those verbal pauses right there trigger you to pay attention. It triggers your emotions. Now, what if you would have said it like this? I have a dream that one day all men and women will be credited equal, not based on their skin, but by the deeds they do.
And he just talked straight like that fast. You wouldn't even remember that speech because no one emotionally would have been impacted by it because there was no verbal pauses. I kid you not. There was no verbal pacing of what he said. So you wouldn't, the people listening to it. wouldn't have internalized that and really connected with that emotionally. The verbal pausing and the pacing of the question triggered everybody listening. and still to this day, to emotionally connect with that speech. Brilliant speech, okay? All right, now I'm gonna show you some examples of this. Pay attention, this is really important. Okay, so let's say in this example. Let's say you sold cybersecurity okay, and you know maybe they're talking to you because something is wrong with the way they've got something set up.
Maybe their fraud stack is set up wrong. And so here's what I'm going to do. This is what's called an NEPQ problem awareness question. Now, if you're not one of our clients, NEPQ stands for neuroemotional persuasion questioning. This is a methodology I invented from my behavioral science background in university and my 18 years in four different industries— two B2C, two B2B— during my career before I retired and started seven level sales training companies. Okay. So I'm going to lean in. This is after I've already, you know, connected with them. Disarmed them with connection questions. I've already found out what the real situation was with situation questions. Now I'm going to build a gap. And help them find problems, okay? So I'm going to lean and say, 'So are you...
100% satisfied with the way your fraud stack is set up? So is your management team 100%? Satisfied with the way your fraud stack is set up, see how I did that now. Where did I verbal pause? Right here. Before 100%. And then I verbal pause right after that before satisfied with the way your fraud stack. Verbal pause is set up. Now, what does that do? Because imagine if I did it this way. So are you 100% satisfied with the way your fraud stack set up? Yeah, it's pretty good. See? said the question too fast. I asked it too fast. So I give the prospect no time to internalize what I just asked. But when I slow down and I verbal pace it up, this is called verbal pacing. Okay.
Write this down unless you're driving in a car. Don't drive this. Don't try to write it down if you're driving. I'm pacing the question. So. I mean, you guys have had this set up with XYZ Vendor the last five years. Are you... A hundred percent. Satisfied with... The way your fraud stack is set up? See the skepticism there. I'm concerned. I've got a concerned tone. A little bit of skeptical tone. Now, why would I say... A hundred percent. Why not say, 'Are you satisfied?' Because no human being is what? 100% satisfied or happy with anything they have, right? Let's say the person you're with now, your partner. First couple months, you were happy. They could do no wrong. They were an angel that had wings, right?
Six months into the relationship. Did you find something you might not like? Yeah, right? Nobody, just the human nature, nobody's 100% happy with what they have. There's always things they want better, okay? That's why I'm using... 100% right there. See what I'm doing there? Now, a lot of you guys have questions in the comment section about how do I apply it to my industry journey or what do I do if the prospect says this or says that? I don't respond. A lot of comments in the comment section, although I do want you to comment about what you've learned from this or what you want me to do in the next training video. So the easiest way to get ahold of me is simply to text. To me. All right.
So I'm going to give you the number. I put it on here on the board. It's 480-637-2944. So 480-637-2944. Just text me on that and I will get back to you and answer your questions. Okay. Let's move on to the training. Hope you wrote that down quick. For those of you who didn't, nothing I can do. All right, NEPQ probing question here. Now, let me show you how to verbal pause. So let's say that the prospect says something's really important. These are just generic. Okay. Not industry specific. I'm going to show you this. So why is this so important to you? Now, though. Can I ask why this is so important to you now, though? Now, why would I verbal pause right before I say the word now?
Because now, where did I cause their brain to go? Why this, whatever this is, fixing whatever, let's say getting a life insurance policy, while this life insurance policy, whatever, going solar, whatever, is so important to them now. That's a timing issue. Notice how I verbal pause right before the word 'their'—that's where their brain to focus. Okay. Now this question is the exact same question. Word for word. But notice where I verbal pause here, which is now going to get their brain to focus on what? Why this thing they want. Or this problem they want to solve, why that. is so important now. Okay. Right here, I'm focused on the word 'now'. So it's like a timing, like why do it now? I'm building urgency subconsciously in the brain.
Can I ask why that's so important to you? Now, though? Well, the reason why it's important now, see, I got their brain to go there because I verbal pause. What if I said it this way? Why is it so important now, though? If they're an easy sale, like a lay down, they'll open up to that. If they're not... I don't cause their brain to think about that. Okay, it's too fast. They'll give me a knee-jerk reaction. Well, I'm still looking. Yeah, it's just important now because we've been talking about it. They're going to give you vague answers. Now here, can I ask why this? It's so important now, though. This is whatever the thing is. So let's say if it's back to the marketing agency, qualified leads. So why is qualified leads?
So important to you now, though. All right. So why is this so important to you now, though? Okay. Now I've got the brain to focus on this, simply because I verbal paused right before the word I want their brain to think about, and a verbal pause right after it forces the brain to think about that. Try that next time. It works wonders now. That's called like I said, verbal pausing. Okay, let's keep going on, because I don't want you to sound scripted. Now let me give you a few more examples here. This is an example of what's called an NEPQ, problem awareness question. Let's say that I have some type of SaaS product. And it weeds out flaky truck drivers because trucking companies.
If they hire flaky truck drivers, they get out on the road, two weeks later, they don't like it. Where does all that cargo set? In the parking lot, collecting dust, and they lose thousands, tens of thousands of dollars a day by not being delivered. So it's very important they find the right drivers. So let's say that you're on a conversation. Your SDR has already cold-called them. Now you've got a booked appointment on Zoom. Okay. So you've been advertising on Indeed the last 12 months. I mean, do you... A hundred percent. Like? The results you've been getting. See, I could ask it that way, okay? So let's say they said they've been on Indeed trying to find good truck drivers for the last 12 months.
So I repeat that back and then say, 'Do you a hundred percent like The results you've been getting?' Now, what did our brain, what did it cause the brain to force to focus on? The word '100%' and 'like.' The results. This is where they're, do you. Verbal pause. So the brain's here. Do you? 100%. Like. The results you've been getting? Now, what if I said it this way? 'Do you 100% like the results you're getting?' Yeah, they're not bad. So do you a hundred percent. Like? The results you've been getting, notice that's a concerned tone. tone that's concerned for them it's a little bit skeptical as well okay now let's say that you're in the recruiting staffing industry i can show you this for every single industry watching me here and i can show it for your industry watching me okay so you've been using indeed the last three years i mean What's caused you to feel like That's not getting you the best people.
Okay. Now I couldn't use that on a cold call. I'd have to restructure it that differently. So you've been, I mean, you guys have been using indeed. So now am I going to ask this question? The first question? No. any sense. This is in the conversation. I've already opened them up. I've disarmed them with my connection questions. I've helped them understand what their real situation is when I ask situation questions. Now I'm building a gap from where they are to where they want to be. I'm helping them find problems. So rather than saying, 'Can you tell me two or three things you don't like about Indeed?' Well, most prospects aren't going to open up to that because they know where that question leads. So right here.
I'm teaching you how to reformat the question with verbal pauses here. That's going to cause them to defend themselves on why what they have is not going to get them where they want to be. So I'm not understanding. You've been with Indeed the last three years. I mean, they're... fairly decent. I mean, what's caused you to feel like That's not getting you the best people, though. Okay. Well, don't get us wrong, Jeremy. It's done a good job for us. But for us to get to the level we feel like, and now they defend themselves on why they feel like that thing, whatever they have, is not going to get them where they want to go. Is that a good thing for you? Yes, it is. Okay. Now, let's keep going here.
I've got a few more examples to show you. Let's say that I sold life insurance. Same thing. And let's say, this lead, I find out in situation questions that they've already got an 80 or 100K work policy. Now, I want to get rid of that as an objection, because what if they come out and say, 'We're good. We already got the 100K work policy.' You know, if I pass away, you know, I'm going to be good. My family is going to be taken care of. So I'm going to say so. I'm not understanding what you've got. This 100K word policy— i mean, what's caused you to feel like that's not going to be enough for Cindy and the kids to live off of the rest of their lives.
See what I just did there? Now I get him or her to internalize why the work policy causes you to feel like that's not going to be enough. For Cindy and the kids to be able to live off their entire life. Okay, now I get him to visualize that, to think through that him or her. And now that emotionally causes him or her to feel pain and have a fear of future pain when they're not there. So you've already got the policy with State Farm. I mean, what's caused you to feel like? That might not be enough for Sydney to be able to retire on time. Now he's forced, he or she's forced to think through why that policy is not going to be enough, they already have. Okay.
Now there's more to that. That's a verbal pause right there, okay? Let's go through another one. Let's say, if you sold financial services, all huge industries for us. So, I mean, you've been with Ameriprise the last 10 years. I mean. What's caused you to feel like that plan? Might not be able to retire you by the time you turn 61. Now, notice all the verbal pauses right here. right here. right here. in right here. Okay? Now, Mary Price, I love you. I'm actually one of your clients. I invest a lot of money with you, but because you've never reached out to us for us to train all your salespeople, I have to put you in these YouTube videos. There you go. You should reach out to us, Ameriprise. I love you.
I love the returns. We just could help you sell a lot more to those people. I love you. All right. So you've been with Ameriprise the last 10 years. I mean. What's caused you to feel like... That plan might not be able enough to retire by the time you turn 61. See, Merle Paul is right here. Okay. Now, cause you to feel, not think. Why would I say feel instead of think? Because do human beings make decisions logically or emotionally? Emotionally, 100% of the time. Brain studies prove that. There's no debate among behavioral science on that. I feel like a drink of water. Because I'm thirsty, I feel like. Notice every decision you make starts with the emotional side of the brain. So you want to keep them on their emotional side of the brain.
When you start saying, 'What do you think?' you're taking their brain back to the logical side. Don't do that unless you want to lose sales, okay? Causes you to feel like... that plan might not be enough to retire you by The time you turn 61. So I'm going to pause differently. Let's say, and I'm just repeating back. Let's say they said they want to retire by 61 instead of 67. I'm causing them to defend themselves. on why the plan they have, they feel, is not going to be enough. Now, like I said, a lot of you guys have questions. So, if you have questions, how do I do this for my industry? Or if you've got any type of...
sales questions, best way to reach me rather than having me respond to all your comments here on this video is to simply text me. So it's 480. I'm going to give you the number one time, 480-637-2944. Typically, after I do one of these, me and a couple of sales trainers will go into the conference room. We sit there for a couple of hours and actually answer your questions. So we will get back to you. Now, one last thing. If you want more training like this, because I typically do about two or three of these training videos every week. Your next step, hit the subscribe button. My only one. And I'd hit the notification button as well. That way you're notified when I actually release a new video every week. Like I said, I do two to three, at least two sometimes every week. My only warning is do not share this with your competitors, what I teach you. So don't share my channel with your competition. I can assure you, you probably don't want them to learn what I'm going to teach you here on these training videos. Hope that helped you today. And I'll get back to your text as soon as I can.
