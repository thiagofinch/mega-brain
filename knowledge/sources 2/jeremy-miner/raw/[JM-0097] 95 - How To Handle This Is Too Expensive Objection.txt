95 - How To Handle -This Is Too Expensive- Objection - YouTube.mp4
You want me to show you one of the biggest objections that you're probably going to start getting very soon? This is going to be one of the biggest objections you will get as the economy starts going down here in the next several months. Could even be weeks or a few months. We just don't know. Prospects are going to say, even though they like what you do, they're going to say, 'We just don't have the budget.' or 'We just don't have the money for this' or 'This is too expensive for us right now.' Can you call back later when things improve? So, if you hate competing on price, you don't like being commoditized. You're going to want to get your prospects into results-based thinking quickly versus price or cost-based thinking, like...
most salespeople do. And you've got to do that from the very first words and questions out of your mouth. You'll say something like this. Do you want me to show you in the vibe board what to do? Come on. Over here, I'll show you real quick. Prospect says, 'Hey, we just don't have the money or the budget for this. Could be B2C or B2B.' You're going to say, 'Yeah, that's not a problem.' So first of all, you just agree with them to get them to let their guard down. You've got to say that slowly and pause. You don't want to say, 'that's not a problem' and start talking. You want to say, 'yeah, that's not a problem.' Tell me if you did have the funds.
Is this something that would work for you? Curious tone. Okay. Now, if I'm selling B2C, probably funds. If I'm selling B2B, I'm probably gonna say 'funding'— don't say 'budget.' If you sell B2B or B2C, do not say 'budget.' Do you know why you don't want to say 'budget'? Tell me if you did have the budget. Okay, budget is limited. It is a capped way of thinking, okay? Funds or funding is not necessarily capped. It sounds like, 'oh, funding to start a business' or 'funds for this.' Budget is a capped word. You don't want your prospects thinking they have to be at a cap. You want them to think results-based thinking, not budget thinking. Big difference there. So I'm going to say, 'Yeah, that's not a problem.' Tell me if you did have the funding.
Is this something that would work for you? Notice how I verbal paused and paste that out now we're going to show you how to do that. And this cool little book called the NEBQ Black Book of Questions. Do you want a copy? I'm going to go over that in a minute, if you want it. You don't have to get it, all right? Then the prospect might say, 'Yeah, for sure.' But we just don't have the money, okay? And then you're going to say something like this. Yeah, and I can appreciate that money might be an issue, from what you told me. How do you feel you can resolve that? So you can find the funds so that you can and then you're gonna repeat back what they said.
Let me do that again. Pay attention to my tonality and my body language, okay? Yeah, and I can appreciate that money might be an issue, from what you mentioned to me. I guess, how do you... feel you can resolve that so you can find the funds so that you can and you repeat back what they said. Now notice I said 'feel' instead of 'think'. Why would I say 'feel'? Because you want your prospects to stay on their emotional side of the brain, because that's how they make buying decisions. If you say 'think,' where would their brain go? Think is the logical brain. Thinking. You want them to stay in emotional thinking, all right? I'm asking: how do you think you can resolve that?
Where can you can find the funds so that you can and you're back what they said they wanted? Notice how I'm tying in the funds and then getting the funding to what getting what they said they wanted if they can get the funding. They get what they want if they can't get the funds. They don't get what they want if they can't get the funds. See how I'm tying that into the result they said they wanted. See how that works? Now there's more to that, depending on what they say there. But you're going to have a lot of them say, 'I could use a credit card' or 'maybe I could get a loan' or 'they could shift the money from something else they were currently spending that on over to your solution.' Or if you sell B2B, a lot of times moving the funds from a different department budget to your solution to buy it.
We can show you all of that right here in this crazy little black book. If you hate having so many of your prospects say, 'the price is too high,' or 'we don't have the money for it,' or 'it's too expensive,' then you're probably going to want to prepare yourself for those type of objections. I know you already get them right now. But when the economy starts going down, you're going to get them—much more. now. Do you want to know how to deal with that and also help prevent that objection from actually happening? Because what I just showed you here was just a little nibble of what we can show you in this book.

And during my sales career, it helped me make... a bit under $33 million in straight commissions. That was during a 17-year career as a sales rep like you working for companies. Now, I know you're like, Jeremy, who cares? You've made that money because your hair looks cool or maybe you think my hair sucks. That's besides the point.
