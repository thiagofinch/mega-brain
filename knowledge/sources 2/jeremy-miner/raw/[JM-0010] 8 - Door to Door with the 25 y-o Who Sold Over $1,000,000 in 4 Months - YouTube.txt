8 - Door to Door with the 25 y-o Who Sold Over $1,000,000 in 4 Months - YouTube.mp4
Yes, are you the property...? No soliciting neighborhood. What are you selling? Oh, geez, I'm not as cool as those salespeople. What are all these people doing here? I'm calling the cops. Do not come to my house. Take me off your list or whatever. Hey, Jeremy Miner here. Look, if you want to prevent doors like that from slamming in your face and you want to get to the highest level as a door-to-door salesperson, I teamed up here with EcoShield. This is their number one. one salesperson in the country, industry record, million dollar man within a four-month summary, Avery. And we're going to go door to door, and we're going to show you how to disarm the prospect so doors like that don't actually happen, and actually how to get their guard down and close the deal.
Hey, how's it going? Sorry for getting the killer going. That's the alarm system right there. You got the alarm system right there. We were swinging over. Did Max mention we'd be stopping by a couple streets over at that big red door? He's over there on Beverly. He's got the big red door. He was supposed to tell everyone we were stopping by. We were getting called out with the weather starting to shift a little bit. Everyone's been getting the little, like, tiny black sugar ants. They've been popping up in the kitchen area. Thank you. And then, with this stucco wall, when the cracks settle, that's how those scorpions have been pushing into the wall voids. I know Max, he was using one of the spray companies like Green Mango. Right.
Did you guys end up using anyone for that kind of stuff? No, we don't use that either. Which makes sense, I mean, usually a lot of the neighbors have been kind of spraying themselves too. The only reason why those guys called us out on these bigger properties we stopped doing the sprays, because you guys can do that stuff yourself. But yeah, I don't even do the spray. I do nothing. Cats and dogs. Well, we actually got the cats eating the scorpions. What's going on over there? We hired the cats. So the big thing with the cats, because they're really good at eating the scorpions, they nest and breed in the yard. Because no one's seen anything inside the house the last few months. It's really with the weather shifting down, like that's when everything starts to push in.
So what we started doing out here that's making a pretty big difference, we actually started treating the yard about a foot down. We'll get all that stuff out at the source. That way, when the weather does shift, you don't have those little tiny sugar ants like sneaking the cat food. Е-е-е. I'll leave you with a bit just so you know for future reference and we'll get out of here. Here you go. Do you know the square footage of the house? Okay, nice house. I'll show you right here. If you were to call us off of Google and we sent a separate truck down to run 275 to do the full flush out. Here's what I got going on. So this stuff usually runs extra. They're like pick and choose.
It's like a la carte. All of the homes I'm working for out here, they've all collapsed. pitched in for this stuff together. So I figured if I can group you guys in while we're already out here, I would actually just include all this stuff for free. Yeah, I got bigger fish to fry than... Okay. I hear you. No, no worries. So how do you build the gap? Start seeding problems in his mind where he... might not think he has problems. You're showing them a ton of bugs and you're just... So they visually have seen them before. Well, they see it exactly. They know it. And it's super easy to paint the picture and... and just start tailoring why it would make sense to get this done. Yeah.
Why people do it. Like why they have you guys come out. Yeah. Totally. And usually you're getting a lot of like, what are your Phoenix reps? So they just have to paint a picture. Ask questions. What have they seen? Maybe in the past, even it's been one scorpion in five years. And then you really just have to harp on that scorpion of why it's going to benefit them. Yeah, because it doesn't really matter— prevent it from happening. Exactly. I mean, when I explain service, usually I try to make it where a five-year-old understands. But when it comes to the benefits, that's what you want to make elaborate because people buy off of emotion. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, yeah.
So sometimes, if you have a prospect like that, it's different for every industry, but sometimes you're like, 'Oh, okay.' So they're like, 'Oh, I don't—I don't see anything.' Oh okay. So you have it like— you haven't been bit by, like, the wolf spider yet. Yeah. Do that yet. That see the doubt that was the first time I actually heard that question. Yeah. Yeah, you just creep. You just creeps in. And then, when you brought up in the front, when he's like, 'Oh, so you have been bit, like, what have you been bit by?' Yeah. All sorts are starting to get the paint. Yeah. He's a tough cookie. And for her out here too, I've noticed there's a lot of screen doors. So that's why I'm trying to get people in their backyard. Yeah, that makes sense. Face to face. They don't have a door to close. Yeah, you want to bring them outside of the door for sure. What it is, is you're getting them to do smaller things where they're complying to what you're asking. Exactly. Which leads to the bigger ask. Totally. Right. Compliance.
The guard dog the only reason why we were swinging you know beverly lane a couple streets over. We've been doing work at Max's. He has that big red door. He's the third house in. You've been doing work over there for like four years now. We were just getting called out, especially with these corner unit lots. They have a lot bigger yards. We're starting to get the little black sugar ants, the tiny ones. It's typically the houses with pets because of the dog food. They'll come into the kitchen areas. Now, I know everyone out here typically has a spray service. He was using green mango. Who did you guys end up going with? They handle all, so you guys rent? Yeah. I'm actually glad I stopped by that because there's a lot of renters in this area specifically.
What we've noticed with the renters, the landlords are great with, like a dent in the garage or maybe if the AC goes out, just because they own the house, they'll protect it. When it comes to liking the little critters, like the ants and scorpions, they don't actually live with them. So they don't really give a crap. What we found out here is whether you guys rent or own, like, literally, no one likes bugs. Cool thing is, since we're doing most of the renters, we offer a massive renters discount. I'll at least leave you with a bid for future reference. Do you know the square footage of the house? So right here, I'll show you. You've got the mansion out here. Yeah. What's going on? You've got the cleanest rides for sure.
I've got to take one of those out for a spin. So for a home your size, if you were to call us up with a phone buck if you weren't here, it would run 275 to send a separate buck down here. I can talk to him. Is it the president? Hello? Uh, I heard talking to somebody outside. You got a lot going on. Hey, don't worry about it. He doesn't have them. Thank you. So. you know, learning these skills door to door. Where do you believe this is going to take you? I mean, once you get good at sales, I feel like literally the sky's the limit. Yeah. Like, especially when you go through the crucible of door-to-door sales. Yeah. Because you would know better than anyone initially starting. It's so tough.
And it's just such a mind game where you're like, can I do this? There's so much doubt. Yes. If you push through that challenge and you make it to the end, I mean, you have the confidence. confidence to do anything yeah it's going to give you all the base blocks that you need to be successful and you know what you just said there was really brilliant because when we train a company could be door-to-door it could be anything we're always saying like hey in the very beginning you know you're not gonna be as good as this because it'd be like being a neurosurgeon and you'd like you're going into your first brain surgery without any education about how to do it exactly right so you're like barely starting so obviously what would be your comp
confidence level as a neurosurgeon if you didn't have any schooling to do the brain surgery like you'd be really not confident 100 so it's the same thing as you develop the skills and as you train like an basketball player like Steph Curry you know he shoot like he shoots like 2500 three-pointers in practice like I think it's like every other day and everybody wonders why he's so good yeah because he's winning the game in practice right exactly and that's what that's what COZ is like you're winning the game like even before you get on the doors before you make the call like you're already winning That game and the more your skill level is developed, it just obviously gives you way more confidence because you're closing more deals. 100, yeah, that's what it's all about.
Hmm. A little of Spider-XX. Yeah. Jag menar, det är inte så fint. Oh. Thanks for watching! Yo. Hey, how's it going? Thank you. Pretty good. Hey, I was just swinging over. You actually might have seen us doing a workout here yesterday. We were just swinging over from Max. He's just three doors. He's got that red door. Three doors down over here. Okay. Yeah, the big red door, like, the frame door. He's always, like, his wife's walking the poodle. Like, Max. Yeah, because you're getting the same stuff Max was. A lot of the spider egg sacks and these little mud doppers are starting to pop up in the corners out here. I mean, it's not just you guys. Like, everyone's been getting them. Okay, so.
Main reason I'm stopping by, after Max's house, I've got about an hour of downtime I need to fill. So if you guys wanted to get all this stuff treated to me, we're doing it for a little bit cheaper. I just don't like answering the door to people that just randomly come up. Sure. Do you get a lot of people knocking on your door over here? What's going on? I don't. That's the thing that's freaking me out a little bit, right? So I want to make sure that you guys are cool. When was the last time you guys were sprayed? I've never, I've never been sprayed. Oh, really? Okay. I gotcha. It might be a good time just, I mean, with the buildup kind of starting to pop up.
Cause let me show you this real quick. Take a few steps out. With all these little egg sacs popping up, when it starts to cool down, they'll get inside the house. So instead of just doing like the little sprays because you could, you know, do that stuff yourself, I'll get all these down, but put a product that just repels them away. That way, if, like, you were like the spouse are walking through the door, you're not getting webs in your face. Usually, it's a little bit more expensive, but it's actually been paid for by all the neighbors. I'll leave you with a quick bid. Just get out of your hair. Yeah. Get out of your hair. Square footage wise, you guys similar to the neighbors, like right around 1000 to 2000 ish.
I just ran, yeah. Cool. If you guys were to call me off the phone book for a home this size, it would typically run $275 to send a separate truck down here. It's already paid, you said, right? Yeah, I'll show you right here. Now, I don't do a monthly service. Have you heard of like Termitex or Orkin, the bigger corporate guys? Yeah. Okay. So they like to come out once a month. What we found out here is that's a lot of chemicals that are getting sprayed on the house and it gets a bit pricey. We're a lot different. I actually just come out every two months because our products are safer. So every two months, it just drops down to the $179. Wait, why are you giving me the pricing though?
Someone else is handling the pricing, right? Totally. I'll walk you through it right here. So that's going to cover the general stuff that you guys are dealing with right here, like the ants, the spiders, all that stuff. This is the only reason I wanted to swing over. Okay, it's all my add-on services. The big thing out here in Arizona is all the bugs come from the yard. So I started treating the yard about a foot down. I'll get all those spiders and ants out at the source. That way. I care about them coming to my house. They're like out there, right? How long have you guys been in the home? Like seven months. Okay. So I'm sure you know as it starts to cool down, when all these guys hatch, they start to pop up in like the kitchen and the bathrooms.
So I know Max, he was really... The wolf spiders. Yeah. Wolf spiders they they catch that's my first time in Arizona. So okay, yeah. So as it as it cools down in the fall that's when you're going to start to see them on the inside of the house. Okay. So when I come by to service, I'm actually going to knock all this stuff down. I'll put a product that repels them away. Okay. That way, on Sunday, when you're trying to watch football, you're not out here like knocking all this stuff down. Your belt. But that's what they pay for— is what you're telling me. Let me walk you through it. So here's what I got going on. If you call this off the phone book, this stuff is like add-on services.
So it's like pick and choose kind of what you need for the home. I probably wouldn't call you off the phone book. I didn't know I needed this in the first place. No, I hear you. Oh, yeah. People always call us, like, after, like, you know, somebody, like, gets bit by the spider and their hand swells up and those type of things. Or, like, a scorpion. Like, where are you actually from? Yeah, well, I was from Minnesota, but I'm here now. You guys don't have like the big scorpions in Minnesota? No, God, no. Could be trolls. So that's a big reason why people have us come out, because they want to make sure, like, they don't get bit. Got it. Or, like, prevent it, if that makes sense.
So when he's saying, like, it's paid for by... your neighbors because the like because of the route that we're using here, like the like some of the neighbors have already got these services where they're paying this they bring that down for this like hour. We're trying to feel like one of our trucks. That's what he mentions. That makes sense, right? So because you guys are already out here. Yeah, it's just easier to kind of tic-tac-toe it. Yep. Okay. So yeah, what we're doing, I'm actually just upgrading you guys for free to all this stuff every time we're out here. Okay. And I was actually knocking the entire property out just for the 275, which pretty much covers everything. Let me grab some basic info from you and we'll get you guys going.
What was the last name? uh, Coleman. Coleman? C-O-L-E-M-E-N? No E, like the cam gear without the E. Same. Yep. Well, what's a good phone number to chat? 626-602. Where's your sister from? Is she from here or like in Minnesota as well? Minnesota as well. Oh, okay. So she hasn't seen like the scorpions yet then. No, but she's, she would freak out. What would go, like where would her jaw go? Like if she saw like the. Scorpion on the ground. She'd lose her mind. I would, you know, she'd probably throw me across. Right. Yeah. I want you to sleep on the couch today. Yeah. So, question for: I have this like really big following and social media on YouTube as well. And we actually, we're a company that teaches like people how to communicate the right way.
Would you get. Angry at us if we brought our videographer up here? No, throw rocks at him or anything. Not at all. No, you didn't get a communication Come up here Brady. All right. So yeah, I own a communication company, have a lot of followers and stuff. We wanted to post something like this online to get your thoughts about how you felt about the communication. This is actually our number one rep in the country. Wow. So with a company called EcoShield, and they help, you know, homeowners like you, you know, like make sure those scorpions are like. All right, so you didn't even like— obviously hard close him because we know that doesn't work as you got his guard down. His guards down. He's relaxed. He's open up. He's laughing.
You just— you know, at that point, you built the trust. You can assume more. What did you do there? Yeah, so I think the big thing is when you start picking up on the little, like, body language of, like, the head nods and... Oh yeah, no, I wouldn't want that to happen. At that point, the sale's done. So how I've always liked to go about it is just asking them something simple. Like, 'Hey, insides included, would you be completely opposed?' And why would we ask that rather than, 'Hey, would you be open?' Why would we train you to say something like, 'Hey, would you be against,' or 'would you be completely opposed,' or would it be a crazy idea if we did this?
Why does that work so well? Well, with the doors specifically, everyone's hardwired to say no. Yeah. So in that situation, when they say no, it actually means yes. Because it's a safer word. An unsafe word is to say yes. So it's hard for them to, like, when you say, 'would you be open?' harder for them to say yes, but easier, easier, like you had said, to say no, because that leads to the yes. Exactly. Well done. Yep. Now, where can they learn more about what EcoShield does? You guys are the third largest pest control company, probably held in the United States. You've got a couple thousand reps.
