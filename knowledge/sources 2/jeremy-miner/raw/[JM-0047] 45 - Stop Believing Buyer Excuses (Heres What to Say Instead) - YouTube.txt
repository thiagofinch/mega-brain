45 - Stop Believing Buyer Excuses (Heres What to Say Instead) - YouTube.mp4
So I want to ask you guys this. I want you to be real with me. When you're looking at buying something and you tell the salesperson, 'I need to talk with my spouse.' How often do you go talk with your spouse? So we know most of the time. That is a smoke screen objection. Okay. That's not the real objection. It's what's behind that—something you have to find out when they say, 'I need to think it over.' Do they really? You sit and think it over for weeks on end and write it out on a Google Excel spreadsheet, the good and the bad of your, they don't do that at all. They're just saying that because they have a concern and they don't want to tell you that. Concern.
So they want to make you feel better by saying, 'I need to think it over, talk to my spouse, so you have some hope.' Don't buy into the story. See, I'm not going to buy into the story because I offer them, if I buy into their story, I offer them no value. Value? How do I solve anything for them if I buy into their bullshit story? I'm not going to do that. I can't help them. So the spouse, it's all about deframing them out of a belief system. Okay, so what's the first belief system that is on the mind of every lead that you call, probably within the first 30 seconds? For most industries, it would be... How much is this going to cost me?
But for your industry, it's how much are they going to offer me? You see, so that's a belief. Okay, so we call that price or cost-based thinking. That's what we call in psychology a frame. So, how do I take him out of that frame, belief system? That's called a deframe. Write down 'deframe'. How do I deframe them out of that? And then how do I reframe them into a new belief system or a new frame, which is to get them to focus? Focus on the results of me taking that property off their property so they don't, you know, they don't their credit doesn't get destroyed for 10 years and now they can't get remarried. I don't know, whatever the thing is.
So that's the first thing you got to understand when your prospects, when you call them for what you sell, that's what's going on in their mind. So your beginning questions really have to start getting them into that different result-based thinking. Now, coming back to the spouse, this is what I was coming with. Give me a problem that one of your last prospects said like, 'Oh, we're looking at, you know, I have to sell the house because of this reason.' What would that reason be? Just give me a random. Relocation, 30 days, divorce. We had a bunch of leads today. They were like, 'We're getting a divorce.' We need to sell the house type of thing. So, job relocation in 30 days, but what's behind that? Who cares? What's behind that?
They can't afford two mortgage payments. Like, what are we finding out that's behind? That because if you just accept, like, I'm looking to sell my house because I have to relocate and move in 30 days, that's still the surface of what's really going on. There's no emotional connection there. That's logical. Human beings make decisions logically or emotionally? Emotionally, 100%. That's proven in brain science. Like, I feel like a drink of water. Because I'm thirsty. Every decision you make starts with your emotional side of your brain and then you justify it for logic, just like that, okay? So anytime they start to tell you the problem, you got to clarify and probe about that. So, okay.
So you're, you're moving in, moving to 30 days, like, and then are you, do you have like a new mortgage payment where you're living or are you renting or what's going on? Oh, I have a new mortgage. Oh, how much are you having to pay for that? What am I starting to do? Build a pain. Build a... There is a pain. But do you see my tone shifted? Oh, how much are you having to pay for that? See, the concern, I'm starting to see doubt, okay? Oh, for... Thousand dollars, and then, let's say, I find out that they can't afford both homes, then I'm immediately going to go back. So, how does your spouse feel about you guys having to like pay for two mortgage payments? I just learned something new.
Jeremy, I have not ever asked that, Jeremy, and I've been trained by you. I need to go read that. That's a hyper-downer, guys. Oh, there's so much more. Hey guys, Jeremy Miner here. Look, a lot of you leave comments wanting me to help you sell more. So, the easiest way to get a hold of me the quickest way is to text me. So, text me right now. It's 480-637-2944. Listen, I started this company to help you learn how to close more deals, but do it the right way. Text me right now. Let's get back to the training video. So that's the first. So when I say I'm deframing and reframing in a new frame, it's the entire conversation. That's all sales is— it's you're continually taking them out of belief systems and reframing them into new belief systems.
And you're looping around and around and around. So that there's more. You're on track. So what do you say? It's you're saying, 'We're heading towards the pattern of, I need to go ask my wife if this price is okay.' You are disconnecting from that belief and reinstalling the belief of your wife is going to be concerned about the two house payments. Yes. And we need to solve that problem. Yeah. And there's... more. So how does she feel about you being forced to pay two house payments? Notice they said 'forced.' Who likes to be forced or made anything to do? See, I emphasize the word. 'Forced.' How does she feel about you being forced to pay two house payments? See the concern tone, the force.
Oh, she doesn't like it all. I mean, does she want you to have to do that if you didn't have to? No, she doesn't want to do that at all. Like we've been fighting about it. See, now I'm still deframing them out of the spouse. I'm deframing out of that. It's really hard for them to come back and say, 'I need to talk with my spouse.' There's still more deframing I'm going to do, but right when I hear that problem and I clarify and probe off of it, I immediately go to, let's say— you had one, what somebody else said, you said something about, what's some other problems? Give me another problem. I'll just show you how to reframe that. Divorce, relocation, downsizing, upgrading. Loss of job. I'm in foreclosure.
Okay, so loss of job. Oh, how long ago did she lose her job? Oh, like five months ago? How does she feel about you guys having to make this payment without her having that income come in? Oh man, she hates it. She's always worried about it. And does she want you to get rid of this property so you guys can move on? Not have that stress? See, like I'm just reframing him into, or her thinking like, 'Oh gosh, no, of course it's very hard at the end for them to have to do that.' And even if they still say they need to talk to their spouse, it's so much easier to help them overcome it at the end, because I've already loosened that up, probably at least 50, 75%.
