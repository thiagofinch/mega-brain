64 - TOP 3 Reasons Why Prospects Are Surface Level With You - YouTube.mp4
Have you ever noticed when you ask what you thought were good questions, a lot of your prospects are giving you vague, generalized, surface-level answers? Well, if that's you, come over to the Vibe Board here. And I'm gonna show you why that's happening. So I'm gonna show you the top three reasons why your prospects are staying surface level with you. And then I'm gonna show you how to re-language your questions so they actually feel comfortable. Actually opening up to you and telling you the truth of what's really going on. All right. So come over here to the Vibe Board. I'm going over the top three reasons. First, you want to write these down for sure. And if you're driving, be careful. You have to try to memorize it, right?
The number one reason why your prospects are saying surface love with you is because you sound scripted. Now look, it's not your fault, okay? Because most of us have been trained this way, okay? We ask a question. Okay. And then the prospect answers the question. So right here. So we ask a question. Okay. We listen. We're taught to listen. The prospect finished. Whatever they're saying, and at the end we say 'okay, cool,' 'gotcha,' 'gotcha,' let me ask you. And those are just fluffy words you're using because you don't, don't, know what to say or ask next. That's why you use those filler words. And it sounds really scripted because if you're talking to your best friend in a normal conversation.
Would you ask a question, then listen, and then at the end say, 'okay, cool,' 'gotcha,' 'gotcha,' let me ask you? You wouldn't. You would just react and go to the next question you were going to ask, or you would just talk. Talk like normal. Okay. And so your prospects guard is up when you do that. Or let me show you another example. A lot of you have been taught, I got a mirror. So when they say something to my question, I need to say, 'Okay, so what I think I'm hearing is you say... and you repeat back everything they say.' The problem is, I want you to think about this for a second. When you're in a real conversation with your relative you trust, your friend you trust, your partner you trust, do you repeat back everything they say and mirror them?
Unlikely. So when you do that to prospects, that feels weird. It doesn't feel natural. It doesn't feel like a real conversation. And that's why eventually they don't like that or they give you pushback, okay? Especially if they're an A-type personality. I'm going to show you how to do that a lot differently, right? So instead of doing this, okay, we have to learn how to bridge from question to question. This is called bridging. We have to use like words like, 'oh,' and 'how long has it actually been going on for? Oh, and what happened then? Oh, and what happened? Let's see. I'm bridging from quite. Ah, and how long ago did that actually? Ah, it's just a bridge. It's called a verbal cue. Okay. So write that down.
You got to use verbal cues. I'll try to. Little bit about that today, okay. But you want to get more training on that, so we can show you way better how to do that. So I'm bridging on how long has that been going on for over the past five years. So before you were doing that, what was going on at that point? See, I'm just bridging from question to question quickly, like a normal conversation. Now, it's a skill. Conversation. It's a structured conversation. You're not winging it. That's not going to help you. But it sounds natural. Okay. Now, let's go back up here. Another reason why you sound scripted here is because when you're in a conversation, whether you're on the phone, whether you're on virtually, like on Zoom, or whether you're in person, doesn't matter.
If you sell B2B, business to business, or business to consumer. Your body is monotonic, meaning you don't really move. So let's say you're on the phone and you're standing up, like I am. You're like, and what actually happened? What actually happened next, John? Okay, and then did you go there to the game after that? And you don't move. So when you have a monotone body, like your body doesn't move, your facial expressions don't move, that affects your tonality. So you sound like a scripted telemarketer when you're calling, okay? So because your body doesn't move, I don't mean do jumping jacks, but I mean move the hands like this or something. Oh, I've only got a few minutes before my next appointment anyways. I'm not even sure if we could do something.
See how I'm moving. That affects my tone. My facial expressions affect my tone. And write this down. Your facial expressions are actually the remote control to your voice. To your tonality. So if your facial expressions just stay the same like this when you're talking, you will typically sound monotone. Imagine watching your favorite movie star, actress, or actor. Let's say you're Tom Cruise fan. You're watching Mission Impossible 17. I don't know. I love Tom Cruise. It's great. And let's say that he gets on there. You turn on the show and the whole time he's talking like this. I think, then, we should go down to the river because the CIA is going to get us down there and there could be a bomb there.
And if I don't detonate the bomb, and be able to get people out of here, then a lot of people could get really hurt. And then we need to go back over to the restaurant because then I have a special meeting with Inspector Gadget. It's just too monotone. You would tune out after a minute. and turn the show off, okay? Same is true with your prospects. They emotionally tune you out because you sound monotone, right? So when you don't move your body— your hands, okay? your facial expressions, your voice— sounds monotone. Think about salespeople that call you that sound monotone, like flatlining the whole time they're talking. It reminds you of what telemarketers are. Hey guys, Jeremy Miner here. Look, a lot of you leave comments wanting me to help you sell more.
So the easiest way to get ahold of me, the quickest way, is to text me. So text me right now. It's 480-637-2900. So 480-637-2944. Listen, I started this company to help you learn how to close more deals, but do it the right way. Text me right now. Let's go ahead and get back in the training video. So as humans, we've all built defensive mechanisms in our brain, in our survival part of our brain, fight or flight. So anytime we feel like we're being sold to, which a monotone voice on a phone or any conversation feels like a salesperson, or they're way, way excited up here. I don't mean be timid. That's not good either. I'm in the middle. I'm an expert. I'm still assertive, like I'm talking now. Okay.
So we built up these defensive mechanisms that anytime we feel like someone is trying to sell us something, we get defensive and our guard goes up. Now, how do we feel that? Based off the tonality of the salesperson talking to us and based on their body language, even if we can't see them because your body language affects what? Your tone, your voice. You with me? Okay, let's keep going on here. There's a lot more. Now, the second biggest reason why your prospects don't open up to you and they give you vague, generalized surface-level answers is because the questions you're asking. Once again, it's not your fault. You were trained this way. But it is your what? It is your problem, right? Nobody's coming to save you except us. That's why we're here.
Okay. So when you ask surface-level questions, what type of answers are your prospects going to give you? They're going to give you vague. Okay, generalized surface level answers because your questions are too vague and generalized. Let me give you an example. We see so many companies and salespeople that come to us to get into our training programs. We look at their scripts and they're asking questions like, 'What are some challenges that you're having?' That's so vague. And see, the problem is your prospects know where this question is leading. That's why a lot of them give you just vague answers because they know they've heard this before. They know the script. OK, they know where that question leads. So instead, I need to relanguage that question.
I might say, 'Let's say if I sold.' Uh, I don't know. Let's say if I sold for a marketing agency and I'm talking to a company that wants to scale their business, they want to get better leads. So John, you guys have been with XYZ Agency the last five years. I mean, what's caused you to feel like they're not going to be able to scale you yourself? See how I rephrase that? Well, we like them, but we don't. And then they start telling you why what they already have or what they're doing is not working for them. Rather than saying, 'What are some challenges you're having?' See how my question was far more specific to what's caused you to feel like that company was not going to be able to scale you.
Now their brain goes to where? Why the company they're with, in this example, that context, is not going to be able to scale them. Here, I can't control where their brain goes. It just goes anywhere. Because it's too vague of a question. Or what about this? What are your goals? Let's say, if you sold fitness, can you tell me your fitness goals? It's just too broad, okay? Specifically, how much weight are you wanting to lose in the next 90 days? See how that question is very specific if I'm selling that fitness or weight loss in that context. Now I cause their brain to think about how much weight. They want to lose in 90 days. If I say, what are your weight loss goals? It's too vague.
I can't really control where that prospect's mind is going. Now, this is not about manipulation. I know some of you are like, 'Well, Jeremy, you're manipulating their brain.' No, it's about causing them to have clarity. In their brain. Because when you ask vague questions, they have no clarity, okay? That leads to uncertainty. That leads, when they start waffling all over the place, their brain becomes cluttered, unorganized. That triggers uncertainty. And what's the biggest reason why prospects have objections? Uncertainty. Who controls if they have certainty or uncertainty? You do the salesperson. Okay, I'm going to show you how to do that, right? Now, the third reason. This is a really big reason a lot of people, a lot of salespeople just don't even consider is you ask your questions so fast that you give the prospect no time to internalize what you just asked.
And so they just give you knee-jerk responses. Like, let's say, if you sold at a car dealership or a retail store or a furniture store and a prospect comes in, what's the first words out of most of your mouth? 'Hey, welcome into the store today. How can I help you?' And what do most people do? Just looking. Because you say it so fast and you say the same question. That everybody says when you walk into a retail store. So what did you just trigger? Prospect's guard comes up because they heard that a billion times and they feel like they're being sold. So instead, I'm going to slow down my tone. Hey, welcome into the dealership today. Are you guys just kind of out looking around?
And I just fed them the objection so they can't say that. So you know what they're going to say? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, and do you know what you're, do you know what you're possibly... looking for? See, I'm pacing out the question that's called verbal pacing. I'm going to get this up here for you. That's called verbal. Okay. Write this down. This is really important. I'm verbal pacing. The question out, okay? Think about some of the best speeches you've ever heard in your life, right? What are some famous speeches? Martin Luther King, I don't have the exact verbiage down, but what did he say? He said, 'I have a dream.' That one day, Men will all be created equal. See the verbal pauses there. I have a dream.
Two second verbal pause. I have a dream. That one day, All men will be created equal. Not based off their color of their skin, X, Y, Z. But based off whatever he said, I don't have it memorized, okay? Now, what would have happened if he said, 'I have a dream that one day all men will be created equal, based on not the color of their skin, but by the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.' And he just said that fast. Do you know what would have happened? We wouldn't even know that speech. Because it would have never had an emotional impact, because he said it too fast. Because he paced that out, he had verbal pauses in between points. He wanted the end user to think about.
That's why it's one of the most famous speeches in the world, in the history of the world. See what I'm doing. That's how powerful. Verbal pacing is. And that's something that we're going to teach you as a sales professional. You will sell way more simply learning how to pace your questions out because what happens when you do that is it causes the prospect to internalize and think deeper about what you're asking. If you ask them too fast, they're just gonna give you a knee-jerk reply. Are you with me? Okay, now, what I'm gonna do now is pay attention now for the next few minutes. is I'm going to show you right here. Okay. I'm going to show you. what questions to ask and how to ask them to get your prospects to open up more.
Okay. Now, when I ask you this question, what are the two biggest emotional drivers? I'm going to change this. What are the two? biggest emotional drivers that cause a human being to want to change. Because for a human being to want to change, that means purchasing what you're offering because they're changing from what they have or don't have. To something new, which is your solution. For them to do that, the two biggest emotional drivers are pain. Write this down. And the fear of... future pain. Okay, that pain's not going to go away or they're going to have pain in the future. They might not have pain now. They're definitely gonna have pain in the future. Think life insurance policy, okay?
Pain in the future if they don't get coverage when one spouse dies and the rest of the family is not financially protected. But I also got to get them to feel pain. about what's going on right now. and in their past, and then that pain is going to continue and it's going to get worse. Now, here's how do we do this. Now, write this down. These are called NEPQ. Now, if you're not familiar with my methodology, I developed in university and in my 17-year status quo before I retired. This stands for neuro-emotional persuasion questioning. N-E-P-Q, neuro-emotional persuasion questioning. That is trademark, by the way. Precision probing. Now, let's say that the prospect starts to tell you something they don't like or some problem they've had. With X, Y, Z that your solution solves, okay?
Instead of just going on to the next question on your script, I need to get them to open up more. I need them to emotionally. Relive what? The pain. Of that situation. If I can't, remember, where the two biggest emotional drivers cause a human being to want to change? Pain. And the fear of future pain. If I can't help them relive their pain, that prospect feels no need to change. And if they feel no need to change, that's why you get tons of rejections and that's why they don't buy from you, okay? So I got to get them open. Okay, can you give me a specific example of when that happened? So let's say, if you're selling, oh heck, I don't even know. Let's say you're selling.
Let's say that you're a real estate agent and you're trying to get a listing from a prospect that had it listed a year ago. With a different realtor. They couldn't sell it. Okay, so they took it off. They took it off the MLS and now you're trying to get the listing yourself. Okay. So they say, 'Oh, the real estate agent that we had did this, this.' Can you give me a specific example of when that actually happened? Oh yeah, like the last time we were meeting with him or her, they said this and see I'm helping them relive the pain. Now I'm using what we call a curious tone here to get them to open up. Now, here's what I'm going to do after that, because that's not...
opening them up that much by just having them tell you a specific example. Of when that actually happened, whatever their problem or whatever emotion they described to you was okay, then I'm going to probe deeper. Then I'm going to say, 'So, how often does that actually happen to you guys Okay, how does that actually happen, or how long has this been going on for? Now that's going to be relative to what you sell in your industry and that's going to be relative to the context. Now notice what is my tone shift down to? A concern tone. A tone that shows empathy, okay? Your tone is how your prospect interprets your intention. Behind everything you say and ask. That's how they interpret why you're asking the question.
So if I'm not asking this type of question in a concerned tone, my prospect is unlikely to really open up to me emotionally because you may feel like I'm genuinely concerned, which you should be. Okay. That means they feel you have empathy towards them and their situation. Does that build trust? Yes. Massive trust. Okay. How often is that happening to you guys over there? How long has that been going on? Okay. Now, let's say if you're selling network marketing, and they're like, 'Oh gosh, I have to commute an hour and a half each way to work.' How long have you had to commute that far? How long has that been going on where you've had to commute that far? Oh, the past five years. See, now, why did I ask him how long?
Because now they feel how long what? They've had the pain. How long have they had the problem? They start to visualize it and they feel how long they've had this pain or problem. And that's what you want. You want them to relive their pain. Look, a lot of you, sometimes I hear this: I get off a keynote and someone's like, 'Jeremy, I love everything.' I just feel uncomfortable having my prospects tell me they're paying. And I'm like, 'Well, that's unfortunate for them.' Because if you can't get them to open up and tell you their pain, and have them have a fear of future pain, they're not going to feel any need to change. When they feel they need to change, you can't really solve their problems and they don't buy from you.
Their problem stays the same. So that is on us, the salesperson. All right. So then I'm going to probe even deeper. Okay. So that's been happening for the last three years. Has that had a... Is that how it impacts you? Now notice my cadence. Look at these, these dots. That's a verbal pause there, okay? Because what would happen if I said it this way? So that's been going on for the past five months. Has that had an impact on you? Well, I mean, it's not too bad. Well, don't get me wrong. I mean, it's not horrible. You're going to get that a lot unless they're a lay down sale. So notice how I verbal pace it out. So Kathy, that's been going on the last six years. Has that had a...
Is that out of? the impact on you. Notice how my voice goes into that concern tone. Remember, a tone that shows empathy. Okay, see I'm verbal. Pacing out the question now. A lot of times I'm like, 'Oh, you have no idea.' And then you're simply going to say, in what way, though? See what I did there? See how I'm getting them to open up even more and keep reliving the pain, right? Pain is good if you want them to change. In what way, though? Oh, just the other day. And then they go on and tell you more about their pain. Okay. Now getting them to just tell you what their pain is. That's half the sale. The other half is getting them to see what the future looks like.
Once the newfound problems are solved, okay? I'm going to show you a little bit more here about how to build this pain, all right? Now, or I can say this. Let's say, if I've got them very emotional, okay? You're reading their body language if you can see them. And or you're reading their tonality. You can tell their emotion. How long has that been going on for? So that's been going on the last, you're talking like the last five years. Has that... Has that had an impact on you? Well, in what way though? Or I could simply lean in and say, 'How long has that been going on for? Over the past five years?' What's that doing to you? See, I can just do that. I can immediately go to that.
How long has that been going on for? You want to ask that question first. How long has that been going on for? You're concerned, okay? Over the last four years? What's that doing to you? Notice concerned tone. Because if I said, 'What's it doing to you?' That's kind of a defensive tone. Well, I mean, it's not bad. Okay. What's that doing to you? See that concern tone. Now, if you have questions about how to probe, easiest way to get a hold of me is simply text me because a lot of you ask questions in the comments. I just don't have time to get back to you. My team doesn't have time. The easiest way is just to text me at this number. I'm going to give you one time.
So write it down. 480-637-2944. Typically, I pull in one or two of my sales trainers and we answer the questions from these YouTube videos for a couple hours every day. So just text me and myself or one of my trainers in this office. Sometimes we want to accomplish them. We'll get back to you, okay? Now, only ask me questions about selling. I have some people that ask me questions about, hey. What type of food do you like? Or Jeremy, who's your favorite baseball team? I don't mind answering that, but my time's very valuable. So only ask me questions about sales, okay? I love the personal questions sometimes. All right, now write this down as well. I'm going to show you how to probe even deeper to one.
Get them to feel the pain of their current situation and their past history. And then to relive the pain. So let's say this is called an NEPQ probing question. We call this precision probing, okay? So they tell you some type of thing, okay? Let's say, for example, let's say you sell for a marketing agency and... let's say that they want to get a higher qualified lead because their salespeople are having a hard time getting a hold of leads. They're just non-responsive. They're not good leads. I'm just making this up, okay? This is generic, deliberately, so you can plug in your industry. So can I ask, why is that so important to you now though? Now that in this context would be a higher qualified lead.
If they're like, we need to get high quality leads. Can I ask why that is so important to you now though? Having a higher quality lead, why is that? So important you know that. Can I ask why having a higher qualified lead? is so important to you now though? Okay, I can plug that in. So just to use the word, why is that so important to you now though? Now listen, look at this. Look at this verbal pause right here. Because what would happen if I said this? Why is that so important to you now, though? See, when I ask a question too fast, I'm going to get vague, generalized, surface-level answers because you give the prospect no time to internalize what you just asked.
But I'm focused on that and I'm going to verbal pause right after that. Can I ask why that? is so important to you now. Notice that now their brain thinks about what that thing they just said. Why is that so important now though? Let's say if you sold network marketing again and the prospect says, 'I just don't want to commute back and forth.' Can I ask why being at home? Why that? is so important to you now. Ah, it's so important to me now because now. That, that thing they said they wanted. Now their brain goes there and they visualize having that. See what I'm doing now. I can ask the same exact question. So read the words here. This question right here is identical to this question right here.
But I'm going to verbal pause in a different place and see how this sounds. Can I ask why that's so important to you? Now, though. Can I ask why that's so important to you? Now though, Now, what did I get their brain to focus on? The word 'Now,' now... is a timing issue. Like, why do they want to do whatever they want now? See how I'm building urgency by simply verbal pausing. This is called a verbal pause. Okay. I'm verbal pausing before the word I want their brain to go to. Can I ask why that's so important to you? Now, though, Okay. See that? All right. See how that works. Now, a lot of you are going to have questions about what I just trained you.
Realize we don't do like three hours on a YouTube video here. So if you have questions about what I trained here, just get questions about selling in general for your industry.
