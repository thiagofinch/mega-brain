<objective>
Rewrite README.md as a consumer-facing document suitable for the npm registry, with clear install instructions, quick start guide, and feature overview.

Purpose: The README is the first thing a new consumer sees on npmjs.com. It must quickly communicate what Mega Brain does, how to install it, and how to get started. The current README is 1224 lines of marketing copy in Portuguese — it needs to be rewritten as a concise, English-first, developer-facing document.
Output: Rewritten `README.md` (~150-300 lines).

## README Strategy

The current README has good content but is:
1. Way too long (1224 lines) for an npm registry page
2. Marketing-heavy (selling, not documenting)
3. Primarily in Portuguese
4. Version badge shows 1.1.0 (outdated)
5. Contains elaborate ASCII art examples that are impressive but not what npm consumers need

The new README should be:
1. **Concise** — 150-300 lines
2. **English-first** — npm is international (can include Portuguese subtitle)
3. **Developer-facing** — install, configure, use
4. **Scannable** — headers, badges, code blocks
5. **Honest** — what's in L1 (free), what's in L2 (premium)

## Structure

1. Hero section (name + one-line description + badges)
2. What is Mega Brain (2-3 sentences)
3. Quick Start (install + setup + first command)
4. Features overview (bullet list or table)
5. Architecture at a glance (simplified diagram)
6. Community vs Pro comparison
7. Requirements (Node, Python, Claude Code)
8. API Keys configuration
9. Commands reference (table)
10. Layer system explanation
11. Contributing + License

IMPORTANT: README.md is auto-included by npm. It's the face of the package.
IMPORTANT: Preserve the banner image reference if the asset exists in the repo.

  <name>Task 1: Rewrite README.md as consumer-facing documentation</name>

  <action>
Rewrite `README.md` completely. The new README must be concise, English-first, and developer-facing. Target 200-300 lines.

**CHECK FIRST:** Verify if `.github/assets/banner.svg` exists. If it does, keep the banner image at the top. If not, skip it.

**Structure to follow:**

## What is Mega Brain?

[2-3 sentences explaining the core value proposition. Focus on what it DOES, not marketing hype.]

Mega Brain is a Claude Code-powered system that ingests expert materials (videos, PDFs, transcriptions, podcasts) and transforms them into structured knowledge — playbooks, DNA schemas, and AI agents that reason with evidence. Built for solo entrepreneurs and small teams who want to operationalize the expertise they've accumulated.

## Quick Start

[3-step install and first use]

```bash
# 1. Install
npx mega-brain-ai setup

# 2. Configure API keys when prompted (only OPENAI_API_KEY is required)

# 3. Check system status
# In Claude Code, type:
/jarvis-briefing
```

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) (Max or Pro plan)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+
- [Python](https://python.org) 3.10+

### API Keys

| Key | Purpose | Required? |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Whisper transcription | Yes |
| `VOYAGE_API_KEY` | Semantic embeddings (RAG) | Recommended |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google Drive import | Optional |

## Features

[Bullet list of key features with brief descriptions]

### Knowledge Pipeline
- **Ingest** any format — videos, PDFs, transcriptions, podcasts
- **Extract** structured DNA: philosophies, mental models, heuristics, frameworks, methodologies
- **Build** playbooks, dossiers, and theme-based knowledge bases

### AI Agents
- **Mind Clones** — AI agents that reason like specific experts
- **Cargo Agents** — Functional role agents (Sales, Marketing, Ops, Finance)
- **Conclave** — Multi-agent deliberation with evidence-based debate

### Developer Experience
- **20+ hooks** for automated validation, session management, quality control
- **Slash commands** for common operations (/ingest, /save, /resume, /conclave)
- **Skill system** with auto-routing based on keyword detection

| `/conclave` | Multi-agent deliberation session |
| `/save` | Save current session state |
| `/resume` | Resume previous session |
| `/setup` | Environment setup wizard |

## DNA Schema

Knowledge is structured in 5 layers:

|-------|------|-------------|
| L1 | Philosophies | Core beliefs and worldview |
| L2 | Mental Models | Thinking and decision frameworks |
| L3 | Heuristics | Practical rules and decision shortcuts |
| L4 | Frameworks | Structured methodologies and processes |
| L5 | Methodologies | Step-by-step implementations |

```

**Writing guidelines:**
- English-first. No Portuguese in the main body (except proper nouns).
- Concise. Every sentence must earn its place.
- Code blocks for commands. Tables for structured data.
- No marketing hyperbole ("revolutionary", "game-changing", etc.)
- Be honest about requirements (Claude Code Max/Pro is expensive).
- Badge versions must match package.json (1.3.0, >=18, 3.10+).
- Keep it under 300 lines.

**IMPORTANT:** The current README is 1224 lines. This is a FULL REWRITE, not an edit. Write the new content from scratch. Do NOT try to preserve the existing marketing content.

**IMPORTANT:** Check if `.github/assets/banner.svg` exists before referencing it. If it doesn't exist, do NOT reference it.
