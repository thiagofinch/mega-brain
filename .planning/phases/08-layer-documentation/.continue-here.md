<current_state>
Running /gsd:discuss-phase 8 to capture implementation decisions before planning.
User selected ALL 4 gray areas to discuss: Document structure, .gitignore templates, Classification criteria, Practical usage.
Completed 1 of 4 areas (Document structure) before context limit hit.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 7: Full Audit - COMPLETE (all plans executed, verified, roadmap updated)
  - audit_layers.py created (411 lines)
  - AUDIT-REPORT.json + .md generated (20,797 items classified)
  - DELETE candidates identified (finance-agent, talent-agent)

- Phase 8: Started discuss-phase
  - Area 1 "Document structure" - COMPLETE:
    - Single LAYERS.md file (not split per layer)
    - Use real examples from AUDIT-REPORT.json
    - Section depth: Claude's discretion based on audit results
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Phase 8 discuss-phase (3 areas remaining):
  - Area 2: .gitignore templates - NOT STARTED
  - Area 3: Classification criteria - NOT STARTED
  - Area 4: Practical usage - NOT STARTED

- After discuss-phase completes:
  - /gsd:plan-phase 8
  - /gsd:execute-phase 8
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- LAYERS.md: Single file, not split per layer (easier to search/compare)
- Examples: Use real paths from AUDIT-REPORT.json (concrete, useful)
- Section depth: Claude decides based on Phase 7 audit data
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - context limit triggered pause, not a blocker
</blockers>

<context>
Phase 8 is about creating documentation for the layer classification system built in Phase 7.
The audit found 20,797 items with 58.6% in REVIEW category - the docs need to help refine these.
User wants actionable docs that let "any person classify a new file."
</context>

<next_action>
Resume /gsd:discuss-phase 8 - continue with remaining 3 areas:
1. .gitignore templates (how to structure them per layer)
2. Classification criteria (decision tree? edge cases?)
3. Practical usage (quick reference vs detailed guide)

Partial CONTEXT.md already saved at .planning/phases/08-layer-documentation/08-CONTEXT.md
