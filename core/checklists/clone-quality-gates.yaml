# Clone Quality Gates Checklist
# Template for tracking gate status per cloning subject
# Reference: core/protocols/quality-gates-9-checkpoints.md
# Schema: core/schemas/quality-gate.schema.json
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this template for each new cloning subject
#   2. Save as: logs/quality-gates/{person_id}/GATES-STATUS.yaml
#   3. Update gate entries as each gate is evaluated
#   4. Pipeline automation reads this file to enforce gate dependencies
